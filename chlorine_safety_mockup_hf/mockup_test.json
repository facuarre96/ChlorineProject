In all the experiments, O2 continuously decreased and CO2 concentration increased, the pH augmented and a significant softening was observed in all the fruits. By day 14, L* values decreased in all the fruits, with the greatest changes found in the chlorinated samples (approximately 12 units). Peppers treated with the aqueous solutions showed greater changes in the quality attributes with increasing washing times and especially when chlorine was used. The exposure for three min to gaseous O3 reduced the mesophiles, psychrotrophes and fungal populations of the fresh-cut peppers in 2.5, 3.3 and 1.8 log units, respectively. Combined with modified atmosphere, this could be an appropriate method to maintain the quality and extend the storage period of minimally processed red bell peppers.", "label": 1}

Biofilm formation may also be of importance for survival and virulence in food-related staphylococci. In the present work, staphylococci from the food industry were found to differ greatly in their abilities to form biofilms on polystyrene. A total of 7 and 21 of 144 food-related strains were found to be strong and weak biofilm formers, respectively. Glucose and sodium chloride stimulated biofilm formation. The biofilm-forming strains belonged to nine different coagulase-negative species of Staphylococcus. The icaA gene of the intercellular adhesion locus was detected by Southern blotting and hybridization in 38 of 67 food-related strains tested. The presence of icaA was positively correlated with strong biofilm formation. The ica,4 gene was partly sequenced for 22 food-related strains from nine different species of Staphylococcus, and their icaA genes were found to have DNA similarities to previously sequenced icaA genes of 69 to 100%. Northern blot analysis indicated that the expression of the ica genes was higher in strong biofilm formers than that seen with strains not forming biofilms. Biofilm formation on polystyrene was positively correlated with biofilm formation on stainless steel and with resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds, a group of disinfectants.", "label": 0}

Because of the parasite's extreme chlorine tolerance, transmission can occur even in well-maintained treated recreational water venues (e.g. pools) and a focal cryptosporidiosis outbreak can evolve into a community-wide outbreak associated with multiple recreational water venues and settings (e.g. childcare facilities). In August 2004 in Auglaize County, Ohio, multiple cryptosporidiosis cases were identified and anecdotally linked to pool A. Within 5 days of the first case being reported, pool A was hyperchlorinated to achieve 99\u00b79% Cryptosporidium inactivition. A case-control study was launched to epidemiologically ascertain the outbreak source 11 days later. A total of 150 confirmed and probable cases were identified; the temporal distribution of illness onset was peaked, indicating a point-source exposure. Cryptosporidiosis was significantly associated with swimming in pool A (matched odds ratio 121\u00b77, 95% confidence interval 27\u00b74-?) but not with another venue or setting. The findings of this investigation suggest that proactive implementation of control measures, when increased Cryptosporidium transmission is detected but before an outbreak source is epidemiologically ascertained, might prevent a focal cryptosporidiosis outbreak from evolving into a community-wide outbreak.", "label": 0}
{"id": "3155", "title": "CPA-7 influences immune profile and elicits anti-prostate cancer effects by inhibiting activated STAT3", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Platinum-based chemotherapy is emerging as the first line of treatment for castration resistant prostate cancer. Among the family of platinum (IV)-based compounds, a member known as CPA-7 inhibits the growth of multiple cancer cell lines. However, how and to what extent CPA-7 elicits its anti-prostate cancer effects in vivo is largely unknown. METHODS: In this study, we firstly assessed the potential toxicity of the synthesized CPA-7 in a prostate cancer model as well as in normal mice. Next, we evaluated the in vitro effects of CPA-7 on the growth of prostate cancer cells using cell counting assay, and calculated the tumor sizes and cumulative survival rate of the tumor bearing mice by Kaplan-Meier method during CPA-7 treatment. Then we measured the expression level of the activated form of STAT3 (one targets of CPA-7) and its transcriptive activity post CPA-7 treatment by synergistically using western blot, IHC, and firefly luciferase reporter assays. Finally, effects of CPA-7 on immune cell trafficking in the tumor draining lymph nodes and in the spleens are evaluated with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Treatment with CPA-7 significantly inhibited growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and also in mice resulting in a prolonged survival and a decreased recurrence rate. These therapeutic effects are due, at least in part, to functional depletion of STAT3 in prostate tumor tissue as well as in the surrounding areas of tumor cell invasion. CPA-7 treatment also resulted in a reduced level of regulatory T cells and increased levels of cytotoxic T and T helper cells in the spleen and in tumor infiltrating lymph nodes. This favorable effect on immune cell trafficking may account for the amnestic immune response against recurrent prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: CPA-7 is a promising new therapeutic agent for prostate cancer that both inhibits tumor cell proliferation and stimulates anti-tumor immunity. It has potential as first line treatment and/or as an adjuvant for refractory prostate cancer.", "label": 0}
{"id": "3364", "title": "High resolution melting-curve (HRM) analysis for the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis in humans", "abstract": "Cryptosporidiosis of humans is an intestinal disease caused predominantly by infection with Cryptosporidium hominis or C. parvum. This disease is transmitted mainly via the faecal-oral route (water or food) and has major socioeconomic impact globally. The diagnosis and genetic characterization of the main species and population variants (also called \"genotypes'' and \"subgenotypes'') of Cryptosporidium infecting humans is central to the prevention, surveillance and control of cryptosporidiosis, particularly as there is presently no cost effective anti-cryptosporidial chemotherapeutic regimen or vaccine available. In the present study, we established a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-coupled high resolution melting-curve (HRM) analysis method, utilizing the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS-2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA as the genetic marker, for the diagnosis of Cryptosporidium hominis, C. parvum or C. meleagridis infection. An evaluation of the method revealed intra- and inter-assay variabilities of <1.5 and 3.5%, respectively. Cryptosporidium hominis, C. parvum and C. meleagridis were detected in 97, 44 and 2, respectively, of the 143 Cryptosporidium oocyst DNA samples originating from Australians with clinical cryptosporidiosis. The melting profiles characterized by peaks of 72.47 +/- 0.33 degrees C and 74.19 +/- 0.45 degrees C (profile 1), 72.17 +/- 0.32 degrees C (profile 2) and 73.33 +/- 0.03 degrees C (profile 3) genetically identified as C. hominis, C. parvum and C. meleagridis, respectively. In conclusion, PCR-coupled melting analysis of ITS-2 achieved the diagnosis of Cryptosporidium hominis, C. parvum or C. meleagridis infection. This approach is well suited for the rapid screening of large numbers of Cryptosporidium oocyst DNA samples and, although qualitative, is significantly less time-consuming to carry out than electrophoretic analysis and has the added advantage of data storage and analysis capabilities in silico. This method provides a useful tool for investigating the epidemiology and outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis, and could be applicable to species of Cryptosporidium other than those investigated herein.

Salinity stress is considered as one of the major abiotic stresses which strongly reduced crop productivity. A pot expt. was conducted at wire house of the National Research Center, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt to elucidate the effect of pre-sowing seed treatment with proline (0, 5 and 10 mM as P0, P1 and P2, resp.) on some physiol., biochem. and anatomical attributes of faba bean (Vicia faba L.) plants under seawater stress (0.23, 3.13, 6.25 dS/m as tap water TW, SW1 and SW2, resp.). The irrigation with sea water was applied 16 days after sowing and lasted for 50 days. Plant samples were collected after 65 days from sowing. Results showed that increasing sea water concn. induced redn. in all growth parameters (plant height, no. of leaves and shoot dry wts./plant), photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids), total carbohydrate, contents of P, Ca++, K+ and K:Na ratio of faba bean leaves compared with those of the untreated unstressed plants (TWP0). Increasing sea water stress led to increases in total phenolics, free amino acids, proline and sol. carbohydrate as well as values of N, Na+ and Cl-. Special attention was paid to the effect of proline treatments on the salt stressed faba bean that stimulates plant salt tolerance via improving growth parameters, photosynthetic pigments, sol. carbohydrate and total carbohydrate meanwhile phenolic content, proline, Na+, Cl- were decreased relative to their corresponding salinity controls. Sea water stress and proline treatments induced over expression for new protein bands with high d. The effect of salinity stress and/or proline on anatomical structure of vegetative organs was under consideration. From these results, pre-sowing faba bean seed treatment with proline seem to enhance faba bean salt tolerance by amelioration of photosynthetic pigments, ion accumulations and anatomical structure of vegetative organs, hence improved plant growth and the preservation of a suitable plant water status under salinity conditions.

The Ames test revealed that 57.14% of dyes were mutagenic and acting directly. The rec-assay detected 50% of dyes to be mutagenic; of these, 71.43% were direct acting, whereas 28.57% required Aroclor-induced exogenous metabolic activation. Used together, the two tests detected 78.57% of the dyes to be mutagenic, and a 50% correlation was found between these two tests. Groupwise, three out of four azo dyes and all five anthraquinone dyes were found to be mutagenic by the Ames assay; the rec-assay detected methine/polymethine (1 out of 3), an oxazine, and a triphenylmethane dye to be mutagenic, besides the azo (1 out of 4) and the anthraquinone (3 out of 5) dyes. The structure-activity analysis attributed the mutagenicity of dyes to the structural alerts such as phenylenediamine, amino and nitro- groups, methylation, CH=CH, and chloro groups; whereas deamination, bulkier groups, and sulfonation may be responsible for diminishing mutagenicity.", "label": 0}

First, chlorination was tested as a ref. disinfection process. Chlorination at a very high dose concn. of Cl2 (75 mg L-1) and a long contact time (10 min) were required to achieve approx. 90% ARB and pB10 plasmid transfer removal efficiencies. However, even these stringent conditions only resulted in a 78.8% redn. of pB10 plasmid concns. In case of ozonation, the estd. CT (concn. \u00d7 contact time) value (at C0 = 7 mg L-1) for achieving 4-log pB10 plasmid removal efficiency was 127.15 mg\u00b7min L-1, which was 1.04- and 1.25-fold higher than those required for ARB (122.73 mg\u00b7min L-1) and a model nonantibiotic resistant bacterial strain, E. coli K-12, (101.4 mg\u00b7min L-1), resp. In preventing pB10 plasmid transfer, ozonation achieved better performance under conditions of higher concns. of humic acid and lower pH. Our study results demonstrated that the applicability of CT concept in practice, conventionally used for disinfection, might not be appropriate for antibiotic resistance control in the wastewater treatment process. Further studies should be conducted in wastewater engineering on how to implement multiple barriers including disinfection to prevent ARB and ARG discharge into the environment.

The effects of ClO2 on bacterial cell morphology, outer membrane permeability, cytoplasmic membrane disruption and intracellular enzymatic activity were also studied to elucidate the mechanism of action on the cells. Increasing temperature and disinfectant concentration were proportional to the rate of cell killing, but efficacy was found to be significantly subdued at 0.5 mg/L and less dependent on the bacterial density. The bactericidal efficiency was higher at alkaline pH of 8 or above as compared to neutral and slightly acidic pH of 7 and 6.5 respectively. The disinfection kinetic curves followed a biphasic pattern of rapid inactivation within the initial 2 min which were followed by a tailing even in the presence of residual biocide. The curves were adequately described by the Cavg Hom model. Transmission Electron Microscopy images of the bacteria cells exposed to lethal concentrations of ClO2 indicated very little observable morphological damage to the outer membranes of the cells. ClO2 however was found to increase the permeability of the outer and cytoplasmic membranes leading to the leakage of membrane components such as 260 nm absorbing materials and inhibiting the activity of the intracellular enzyme beta-D-galactosidase. It is suggested that the disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane and subsequent efflux of intracellular components result in the inactivation of the Gram-negative bacteria.", "label": 0}

In the last decades, this enzyme has been targeted for inhibition but despite the numerous efforts made to identify potent and safe ALR2 inhibitors, many clinical candidates have been a failure. For this reason the research of new ALR2 inhibitors highly effective, selective and with suitable pharmacokinetic properties is still of great interest. In this paper some new N-(aroyl)-N-(arylmethyloxy)alanines have been synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit ALR2. Some of the synthesized compounds exhibit IC50 in the low micromolar range and all have proved to be highly selective towards ALR2. The N-(aroyl)-N-(arylmethyloxy)-?-alanines are a promising starting point for the development of new ALR2 selective drugs with the aim of delaying the onset of diabetic complications.", "label": 0}

{"id": "6201", "title": "Influence of lactic acid and acetic acid on Salmonella spp. growth and expression of acid tolerance-related genes", "abstract": "Salmonella spp. is an important foodborne pathogen, often associated with meat products. This pathogen presents a complex tolerance mechanism in the presence of organic acids, which is regulated by a diversity of genes, including rpoS, nlpD and clpP. The present study aimed to measure the expression of such genes by Salmonella strains subjected to acid stress conditions, and associate these data with microbial growth. A culture collection composed of 79 strains of Salmonella spp. obtained from bovine and swine production chains was subjected to PFGE using XbaI, and 3 strains (serovars Derby, Typhimurium and Meleagridis) were selected for acid tolerance trials. The selected strains were inoculated in meat extract broth (MEB) added to lactic or acetic acids at a final pH of 4.0, 5.0 or 6.0, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. As controls, Salmonella strains were inoculated in MEB at pH 7.0, and incubated in the same conditions. Bacterial populations were monitored by direct plating and gene expression using qPCR. Salmonella presented similar populations to controls and evident expression of rpoS at pH 5.0 and 6.0. However, Salmonella populations were not detectable after 6 h at pH 4.0. The adaptability of Salmonella to pH 5.0 and 6.0 emphasizes the importance of adequate monitoring of pH reduction during cleaning procedures in food industries, such as organic acid spraying in bovine carcasses. The data obtained demonstrated the relevance of rpoS in the acid tolerance mechanism of Salmonella strains, prompting further studies to investigate its expression in meat systems.", "label": 0}

Due its intrinsic multidrug resistance and its ability to colonize several environments, we selected Ps. aeruginosa isolates as indicator of antimicrobial resistance frequency. Methods and Results : Twenty-seven Ps. aeruginosa strains isolated from five stages of HWTP identified by rrs 16S rDNA sequencing were submitted against 12 antimicrobials through disk diffusion method. Among these isolates, 62\u00b79% showed aztreonam resistance, followed by ticarcillin/clavulanic acid (33\u00b73%) and cefepime (22\u00b72%). Of these isolates, 22\u00b72% were classified as multidrug-resistant (MDR ? 3 classes). Five 16S rRNA gene libraries of Pseudomonas genus were constructed, one for each stages of the plant, yielding 93 sequences clustered in 41 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Each treatment step showed unique OTU's compn., suggesting changes in Pseudomonas spp. communities during the process. Several Pseudomonas species involved in biodegrdn. and bioremediation of xenobiotics were detected suggesting a pos. impact in the wastewater treatment. Conclusions : Our strategy using metagenomics assocd. with the isolation of Ps. aeruginosa strains as bio-indicator allowed us to assess their antimicrobial susceptibility, the viability and diversity of Pseudomonas species in the hospital wastewater. Significance and Impact of the Study : The presence of MDR bacteria from treated effluents alerts for the need to improve these systems to avoid the spreading of resistance genes in aquatic ecosystems. This has special relevance in Brazil, where a significant portion of the population has no access to treated water. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}

Highest concentrations in fishes and lamprey are PCN congeners such as nos. 42, 52, 60, 61 and 69, which do not have vicinal (adjacent) carbon atoms unsubstituted with chlorine (NVC-Cl PCNs) and seem to be relatively resistant in the marine environment. In mussel, chloronaphthalenes such as nos. 38/40, 33/34/37, 28/43 and 47 dominate, i.e. the congeners, which have two or three vicinal carbon atoms unsubstituted with chlorine (DVC-Cl and TVC-Cl PCNs).
