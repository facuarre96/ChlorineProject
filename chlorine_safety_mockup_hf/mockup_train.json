A study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of a spray application of chlorine in killing Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, yeasts and molds, and total aerobic mesophilic microorganisms on whole apples, tomatoes, and lettuce leaves. Inoculated produce was treated (sprayed and then soaked) with water (control) or solutions containing 200 or 2,000 ppm of chlorine for 0, 1, 3, 5, or 10 min, rinsed with sterile water, and analyzed for populations (CFU/cm2) of target microorganisms. Compared to the control treatment, further reductions in numbers of pathogens of 0.35 to 2.30 log CFU/cm2 were achieved by treatment with chlorine. Chlorine was generally more effective at 2,000 ppm than at 200 ppm. Inactivation of microorganisms occurred essentially within 1 min after application of chlorine. These reductions are significant relative to populations of pathogenic microorganisms that may be present on produce. Spray application of chlorine to raw produce at food service or household levels may be a suitable, and more convenient, alternative to treatment by dipping or submersion.", "label": 1}

Moreover, toxic Shiga strains of bacteria E. coli can cause life-threatening hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Because of the recent restrictions imposed on the usage of chlorine, outbreaks of these two bacterial species have become more common. In this study we have developed a novel rotation generator and its effectiveness against bacteria Legionella pneumophila and Escherichia coli was tested for various types of hydrodynamic cavitation (attached steady cavitation, developed unsteady cavitation and supercavitation). The results show that the supercavitation was the only effective form of cavitation. It enabled more than 3logs reductions for both bacterial species and was also effective against a more persistent Gram positive bacteria, B. subtilis. The deactivation mechanism is at present unknown. It is proposed that when bacterial cells enter a supercavitation cavity, an immediate pressure drop occurs and this results in bursting of the cellular membrane. The new rotation generator that induced supercavitation proved to be economically and microbiologically far more effective than the classical Venturi section (super)cavitation.", "label": 0}

In this study, wastewater genotoxicity in a MF-RO process for municipal wastewater reclamation and also the effects of chemical agent injections were evaluated by SOS/umu genotoxicity test. The genotoxicity of RO concentrate ranged 500-559 mug 4-NQO (4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide)/L and 12-22 mug 4-NQO/mg DOC, was much higher than that of RO influent. Further research suggested that Kathon biocide was a key chemical agent associated with the genotoxicity increase. Kathon biocide used in RO system was highly genotoxic in vitro and Kathon biocide retained in RO system could contribute to a higher genotoxicity of RO concentrate. Hence, treatments for biocides before discharging are necessary. Chlorination of secondary effluent could significantly decrease the genotoxicity and increasing chlorine dosage could be an efficacious method to decrease the genotoxicity of RO concentrate. According to the result of the experiment, the dosage of chlorine in dual-membrane process could be set to about 2.5 mg Cl(2)/L. The effect of antiscalant (2-phosphomobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid) was also investigated; it turned out to have no effect on genotoxicity.", "label": 0}

The iodine concentration in cow's milk depends on the iodine intake in the animal's daily rations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first experiment, which lasted for 90 days, investigated the effectiveness of salt licks containing 0 (control group), 150, and 300 mg I/kg (experimental groups) and the effect on the iodine content of cow's milk and blood plasma. The second experiment determined the effect of udder disinfection and iodine teat dipping with iodine disinfectant (experimental group) compared to chlorine dip (control group) on the iodine content of milk and blood plasma. Milk iodine and blood plasma concentrations were meas- ured using the Sandell-Kolthoff method modified by the Bobek and Kolczak procedure. RESULT: Salt licks containing 150 and 300 mg I/kg increased iodine intake by 7.5 and 15.0 mg I/day, respectively. Average iodine intake in the control group was 6.23 mg I/day, and 13.68 and 21.10 mg I/day in the experimental groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in the average cows' milk yield, which averaged 21.0 +/- 1.1 kg/day. Average milk iodine content was 53.8 mug/1000 mL (control group), 65.0 and 84.7 mug/1000 mL (experimental groups). Average plasma iodine content tended to increase in the experimental groups, but the differences between the groups were not significant. In the second experiment iodine udder disinfection and teat dipping increased average milk iodine content from 44.0 +/- 1.6 to 59.3 +/- 2.3 mug/1000 mL. Average plasma iodine content increased only slightly, with a non- significant difference between the control and experimental groups. CONCLUSION: The iodine content of salt licks at 150 and 300 mg I/kg makes it possible to obtain from 65 to 85 mug I/1000 mL of cow's milk. Pre-milking udder hygiene and post-milking iodine teat dipping additionally increase the iodine content of milk by around 15 mug I/1000 mL milk, i.e. an increase of 35% in relation to cows from the control group.", "label": 0}

Animals were envenomated by intramuscular injection of SSV at a dosage of 0.34 mg/kg. Systemic hemodynamics showed no significant changes except for a tendency of decrease in cardiac output (CO). The glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the rate of urine flow (V) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), and effective renal blood flow (ERBF) significantly decreased, while filtration fraction (FF) significantly increased at 180 min after envenomation. Envenomated animals showed a reduction in renal fraction (RF), while renal vascular resistance (RVR) increased stepwise throughout the experimental periods. Animals pretreated with sodium bicarbonate showed no significant changes of CO, TPR MAP, HR, and packed cell volume (PCV) while receiving sea snake venom. Animals pretreated with sodium bicarbonate showed no changes in GFR, ERPF, ERBF, RF, and RVR after envenomation. The rate of urine flow markedly increased in envenomated animals which received pretreatment with bicarbonate. After envenomation alone, there were no differences in the plasma concentration of sodium (PNa) and chloride (PCl) as compared to the control value, whereas the plasma concentration of potassium (PK) increased at 180 min after envenomation. Animals pre-treated with bicarbonate showed a stepwise increase in both UNaV, FE(NA), U(Cl)V, and FE(Cl) accompanying SSV injection. Neither PNa nor PCl were affected, while PK significantly decreased in animals given SSV with bicarbonate loading. UKV and FEK increased stepwise in envenomated animals treated with bicarbonate throughout the period of study. All groups of animals given SSV, with or without NaHCO3 infusion, showed a marked elevation of the concentration of urinary myoglobin (U(Mb)), plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and plasma creatine phosphokinase (CPK) throughout experimental periods. The urinary myoglobin excretion markedly increased in animals after SSV injection accompanied by NaHCO3 infusion. It can be concluded that large amounts of myoglobin present in the renal tubules in envenomated animals can precipitate, particularly under acidic conditions, resulting in increased intratubular pressure and subsequently decreased renal hemodynamics including GFR and ERBF. An infusion of NaHCO3 to render urine more alkaline could have a protective role against depression of renal function following sea snake venom administration.", "label": 0}

The competition for water resources coupled with the generation of wastewater is creates addnl. pressure on the available supplies and increasing pollution level. To address such challenges it has become necessary to build new or enhance existing treatment systems. In different part of Iraq including in Samarra City effort is being made to enhance the water quality in regard to its phys., chem., and biol. characteristics as well as the minerals and org. substances which may produce adverse physiol. effects. In order to evaluate different aspect of water quality this study focused on evaluating the drinking water quality and also the performance of the two treatment plants in Samarra City located on the left bank of Tigris River to the north of Baghdad City. The investigation covered the period of Dec., 2004 to May, 2005. The first is the main conventional water treatment plant with a capacity of 2400m3/h. and the second is a compact unit with a capacity of 200m3/h. The collected water data cover some of the important phys. and chem. parameters of water quality; covering temp., TDS, turbidity, pH and residual chlorine. While the bacteriol. parameters covered total plate count (TPC) and E-coli for stages of treatment plants. The results show that turbidity of raw water is not high (3.84-425) NTU compared with Al-Karkh water project in Baghdad City (6-1400) NTU, because the intakes of WTPs are located in the downstream of Samarra barrage which serves as a pre-sedimentation tank. Low clarifiers turbidity removal efficiencies of (48.323 %) and (32.09 %) were obtained for treatment plant and compact unit resp., while for filters removal efficiencies were (63.2 %) and (39.05 %) resp. The monthly av. turbidity of supplied water for conventional water treatment plant and compact unit were (4.3 and 18.2) NTU, the percent of violation to Iraqi Specifications were (29.4 % and 64.7%) resp. Not always, increasing in raw water turbidity result in an increase in turbidity removal efficiency. pH values and TDS concns. of supplied water are within Iraqi, EPA and WHO Specifications. Low amt. and interrupted chlorination in WTP and CU, so, irregular chlorination results in frequent outbreak of waterborne diseases. It can be recommend to improve the water quality monitoring program through the application of; coagulant aids to overcome the high turbidity of raw water during the rainy season, the hexagonal tube settler in the sedimentation tank of the compact unit to get the designed SOR and anthracite with sand as a dual porous media to increase the filtration rate to overcome the shortage in hot seasons.

The concentration of free chlorine greatly affects the PL emission of the ZnO QDs at 525 nm. Since hypochlorite gains electrons with high efficiency, it takes electrons from the oxygen vacancies of ZnO QDs, which gives rise to defect emission in ZnO QDs. UV-vis data analysis shows that free chlorine does not affect the optical absorption spectra of ZnO QDs. The optical sensing of free chlorine using ZnO QDs has several advantages, like quick response time, good selectivity and of course high sensitivity. The pH has very little effect on the PL emission of ZnO QDs. It does not interfere in the sensing mechanism for free chlorine. After 60 s, the response of the ZnO QDs remains stable. The present sensor shows high selectivity with respect to various common cations, as well as anions.", "label": 0}

In order to go deeply into the mechanism of the process, the behaviors of two dissolved-type electrodes (ordinary steel and aluminum) and a non-dissolved-type (carbon graphite) electrode were compared. The ordinary steel electrode was found more efficient for E. coli cells destruction compared to aluminum and carbon graphite electrodes. In order to determine the most favorable condition for the treatment, the effect of various supporting electrolytes including, sodium chloride, sodium sulfate and sodium nitrate, was scrutinized. E. coli is inactivated by 5 log units for a charge loading of 37.30 F/m(3) for sodium sulfate, 24.87 F/m(3) for sodium nitrate and 12.43 F/m(3) for sodium chloride. It thus appears that the most favorable supporting electrolyte type for this method of disinfection is sodium chloride, a fact which can be explained by the formation of disinfectant by-products such as chlorine dioxide, hypochlorite ions and perchlorate ions. From the results obtained, electrocoagulation applied to the elimination of E. coli proceeds through three combined effects: the electric field, the actions of oxidants electrogenerated during the process and the adsorption by the metallic hydroxides formed in solution.", "label": 1}

Significant differences emerged only for L. monocytogenes (after 40 and 60 min). Highest reductions (up to about 8 log CFU/ml) were observed by using the silver and brass electrodes after 60 min. Differences in terms of electrical parameters (voltage, current, active power) and chemical species generated in the liquid medium (nitrites and nitrates concentrations) were not significant, relevant or directly attributable to the decontamination efficacy of the different electrodes. Ozone production was higher for oxidation-resistant electrode materials. The decontamination effect was influenced by silver and brass antibacterial properties.

Herein, novel polyamide (PA) TFC NF membranes synthesized through interfacial polymerization (IP) of amino functional polyethylene glycol (PEG) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) are designed for achieving dual resistance to fouling and chlorine. The hydrophilic PEG based PA TFC NF membranes show positive charge since the isoelectric points range from pH=8.9 to pH=9.1 and the salts rejection are in the order of R(MgCl<inf>2</inf>)>R(MgSO<inf>4</inf>)>R(NaCl)>R(Na<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>). The high chlorine resistant performance has been proven by maintaining good salt rejections and high water flux of PEG based membranes after treatment by 2000ppm NaClO for 24h. Besides, high hydrophilicity (water angle of 15-18.2\u00b0) accounts for the excellent fouling resistance of the PEG based membranes with a water flux recovery of 90.2% using BSA as a model molecule. Importantly, the hydrophilic PEG based NF membranes have been exploited to separate several water soluble antibiotics (such as tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic applied in the treatment of various types of bacterial infections). By optimizing operating conditions, the advanced membranes show highly stable tobramycin solution flux of 37Lm<sup>-2</sup>h<sup>-1</sup> alongside tobramycin rejections up to 96% with 50ppm feed concentration under 8.0bar. When the feed concentration increases up to 800ppm, our membranes can still exhibit a high rejection over 92%.

Among the seven isomers, only ?-BHC has a potent insecticidal activity. ?-BHC poisoning symptoms accompanied by the violent tremor of the body, particularly in the legs and abnormal fluttering were consistently correlated with central nervous system effects, and the action was shown on the ganglia rather than on the isolated nerve cord. The excitatory effects of ?-BHC poisoning on spontaneous activity and synaptic function in the sixth abdominal ganglion of the American cockroach result from the presynaptic action that causes an excessive release of acetylcholine. F.

{"id": "500", "title": "Quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides: hypoxia-selective therapeutic agents", "abstract": "A problem that confronts clinicians in the treatment of cancer is the resistance of hypoxic tumors to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Thus, the development of new drugs that are toxic to hypoxic cells found in solid tumors is an important objective for effective anticancer chemotherapy. We recently showed that the heterocyclic aromatic N-oxides, quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides (QdNOs), are cytotoxic to tumor cells cultured under hypoxia. In this study, we evaluated the hypoxia-selective toxicity of four diversely substituted QdNOs and determined their effect on the expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1alpha in the human colon cancer cell line T-84. The various QdNOs were found to possess a 50- to 100-fold greater cytotoxicity to T-84 cells cultured under hypoxia compared with oxia. Interestingly, the hypoxia cytotoxicity ratio (HCR), the ratio of equitoxic concentrations of the drug under aerobic/anoxic conditions, was highly structure related and depended on the nature of the substituents on the QdNO heterocycle. The most cytotoxic 2-benzoyl-3-phenyl-6,7-dichloro derivative of QdNO (DCQ) was potent at a dose of 1 microM with an HCR of 100 and significantly reduced the levels of HIF-1alpha transcript and protein. The 2-benzoyl-3-phenyl derivative (BPQ) had a hypoxia potency of 20 microM and an HCR of 40. By contrast, the 2-aceto-3-methyl and the 2,3-tetramethylene (TMQ) derivatives of QdNO were much less cytotoxic under hypoxia (HCRs of 8.5 and 6.5, respectively) and reduced the expression of HIF-1alpha mRNA to a much lesser extent. Because the nonchlorinated analogue BPQ did not demonstrate behavior similar to that of DCQ, we hypothesize that the C-6, C-7-chlorine of DCQ might play a significant role in the selective hypoxic cytotoxicity of the drug.", "label": 0}

In this study, nisin and two Enterococcus faecium strains were evaluated for their effect on biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes cultured in brain heart infusion broth and on stainless steel coupons. Elimination of preformed L monocytogenes biofilms by peroxyacetic acid also was tested. Adhesion control experiments were performed with pure cultures of L. monocytogenes after swab collection of adhered cells, which were then enumerated on PALCAM agar plates and visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Formation of a biofilm was recorded when the number of adhered cells was at least 10(3) CFU/cm(2). When L. monocytogenes was cocultured with E. faecium bac(-), the number of adhered L. monocytogenes cells was 2.5 log lower (P = 0.002) when initially compared with the control culture, but after 6 h of incubation a biofilm was again detected. However, in coculture on stainless steel coupons, E. faecium bac(+) inhibited L. monocytogenes adherence and did not allow biofilm formation for up to 48 It (P < 0.001). In the presence of nisin or after treatment with peroxyacetic acid, bacterial growth was reduced (P < 0.001) up to 4.6 and 5.6 log CFU/cm(2), respectively, when compared with L. monocytogenes cultures on untreated coupons. However, after these treatments, cells were still present, and after 24 h of incubation, a renewed biofilm was detected in L. monocytogenes cultures treated with nisin. Although all tested conditions reduced L. monocytogenes growth to some extent, only coculture with E. faecium bac+ efficiently reduced biofilm formation, suggesting a potential control strategy for this pathogen.", "label": 0}

Additionally, a combined treatment of immersion in HOCl, followed by immersion in ASC and then exposure to ClO2, gas was investigated. Tomatoes were spot inoculated with a 5-strain Salmonella cocktail on smooth surfaces, stem scar tissue, or puncture wounds. A 3 replicate set of each of the sample groups was stored at 20 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH) and retested after 5 d. Greater than 4.0-log unit reductions of Salmonella spp. inoculated on the smooth surface of the tomatoes were seen for all aqueous sanitizer treatments, with Salmonella populations below the detection limit after 5 d of storage. All aqueous treatment groups showed > 1.0-log unit reductions in Salmonella at the stem scar and > 2.0-log unit reduction at puncture wounds. The ClO2 gas treatment reduced Salmonella to undetectable levels at the stem scar, but had no apparent effect on populations inoculated in puncture wounds. The combined treatment resulted in a 3.0-log unit reduction of inoculated Salmonella at puncture wounds. in all cases except for treatment with chlorine, surviving Salmonella populations did not increase after the 5 d of storage.

Soil salinity causes a significant redn. in plant yield and productivity depending on the redn. of the influx of water into the roots caused by the high external osmotic potential in the soil. Due to salinity problems worldwide, each year about 2-3 Mha of land go out of agricultural prodn. Therefore, the development of salinity-tolerant crops is crucial for sustainable agriculture. Hence, understanding the physiol., biochem., and mol. basis of plant salt tolerance will help to improve salt stress tolerance in plants. It has been reported by different researchers that salt tolerance is a complex trait interacting with plant metab., leading to inhibition of growth, development, and reprodn. of plants. Salt tolerance requires the involvement of several different traits, such as the accumulation and compartmentalization of ions, the synthesis of compatible solutes for osmotic adjustment, the ability to accumulate essential nutrients such as K+ and Ca2+ in the presence of high concns. of Na+, the ability to limit the entry of these saline ions into the transpiration stream, to continue to regulate transpiration in the presence of high concns. of Na+ and Cl-, and an efficient reactive oxygen species-scavenging capacity.

Inoculated tomatoes were then passed single file over a 1.5-m conveyor equipped with plastic, foam, or brush rollers followed by 25 previously washed uninoculated tomatoes. Tomato samples were collected after 2 min of both washing and roller conveying, with all 25 uninoculated tomatoes collected individually after conveying. Roller surface samples were collected before and after conveying the uninoculated tomatoes. Both tomato and surface samples were quantitatively examined for Salmonella by direct plating or membrane filtration using xylose lysine Tergitol 4 agar. Regardless of the roller type, Salmonella populations on inoculated tomatoes did not significantly (P < 0.05) decrease during contact with the roller conveyors. After conveying uninoculated tomatoes over contaminated foam rollers, 96% of the 25 tomatoes were cross-contaminated with Salmonella at >100 CFU per tomato. With plastic rollers, 24 and 76% of tomatoes were cross-contaminated with Salmonella at 10 to 100 and 1 to 10 CFU per tomato, respectively. In contrast, only 8% of 25 tomatoes were cross-contaminated with brush rollers with Salmonella populations of 1 to 10 CFU per tomato. Overall, cross-contamination was greatest with foam, followed by plastic and brush rollers (P < 0.05). Adding peroxyacetic acid or chlorine to the wash water significantly decreased cross-contamination during tomato conveying, with chlorine less effective in controlling Salmonella on foam compared with plastic and brush rollers.", "label": 0}

The consumption of RTE vegetables has increased in Brazil over the last two decades, but little is known about the risks associated to the consumption of these products. This study evaluated the prevalence and counts of L. monocytogenes in 512 packages of ready-to-eat vegetables marketed in Sao Paulo. The isolates were characterized for their serotypes, ribotypes, positivity for virulence genes inlA, inlC and inlJ, resistance to chlorine, growth rate variability and capability to form biofilm on stainless steel (AISI 304, #4) coupons. L. monocytogenes was detected in 3.1% of the samples. Only five samples presented countable levels, with counts between 1.0x10(1) and 2.6x10(2)CFU/g. Isolates belonged to serotypes 1/2b or 4b and most were positive for genes inlC and inlJ. Ribotypable isolates were grouped into four groups: 1038 (69.4%), 19175 (11.3%), 19191 (17.7%) and 18604 (one isolate). Most isolates survived to exposure to 125 ppm of a chlorine-based disinfectant for 3 min. All isolates were capable to attach to the coupons, reaching counts above 4 log(10) CFU/cm(2) and the growth rate (mu) at 25 degrees C of the majority of the isolates varied between 0.1 and 0.2 log OD/h, but for few strains the mu was as high as 0.26 log OD/h. Results of this survey indicate that RTE vegetables may be vehicles of L. monocytogenes strains with limited variation in serotype, ribotype and virulence factors but varying significantly in resistance to chlorine disinfectants, capability of forming biofilm and growth rate. Data obtained is of foremost importance to serve as baseline for the development of scientific-based policies to control the incidence of L. monocytogenes in RTE vegetables in Brazil.", "label": 0}

Understanding the phys. and chem. characteristics of NOM is essential to improving drinking water treatment processes. The size of NOM has important implications for drinking water treatment and the formation of DBPs, where the high mol. wt., hydrophobic components of NOM have been found to be effectively removed by conventional drinking water treatment processes, while the lower mol. wt. and certain hydrophilic components of NOM are more difficult to remove using these processes. In our study, we collected raw (untreated) waters from three different drinking water reservoirs, characterised the mol. wt. (MW) distribution of the NOM in these waters using anal. scale high performance size exclusion chromatog. (HPSEC), and isolated apparent MW (AMW) fractions of the NOM using preparative scale HPSEC. We also investigated the reactivity of the AMW fractions of NOM in terms of disinfection byproducts (DBP) formation potential from chlorination and chloramination. We focused on the formation potential of halogen-specific adsorbable org. halogen (AOX) and nitrogen-contg. DBPs (N-DBPs), since brominated and iodinated DBPs and N-DBPs have been reported to be significantly more cytotoxic, genotoxic, and carcinogenic than the regulated DBPs. Our study found that the AMW fractions of NOM with higher SUVA254 values generally produced higher concns. of halogenated DBPs, measured as halogen-specific AOX. Halogenated N-DBPs formed only a small fraction of AOX in both chlorination and chloramination, with higher relative contributions from halogenated N-DBPs in chloraminated samples. The propensity of the formation of N-DBPs, esp. N-nitrosamines and haloacetamides, was higher in chloramination. Since these DBPs are more toxic than the regulated DBPs, further evaluation of the health risk trade-offs when selecting chlorine or chloramine as a disinfectant is essential. The size of NOM had little influence on the formation of halogenated N-DBPs, but the low to medium AMW fractions of NOM tended to form higher concns. of N-nitrosamines. Chlorine tended to be incorporated into the higher AMW fractions of NOM, while bromine and iodine seemed to be preferentially incorporated into the lower AMW fractions of NOM. Since conventional water treatment processes are ineffective for the removal of the low to medium MW fractions of NOM, improved water treatment processes may be needed to minimise the formation of brominated and iodinated DBPs, as well as N-nitrosamines, esp. for source waters that contain significant amts. of org. matter of low to medium MW.

The same concentrations of metaldehyde activated a complex, excitatory response in previously quiescent siphon/mantle preparations but did not modify the contractile responses of the preparations to acetylcholine. The relatively low level of toxicity of metaldehyde to zebra mussels, compared to its toxicity to snails and slugs, and the difficulty of applying this relatively insoluble molluscicide in the aqueous environment suggest that metaldehyde would not be an effective zebra mussel control agent.

The genotoxic effects were assayed by two biochemical methods developed for detection of single-strand breaks of DNA in mammalian cells, i.e., by the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) and by the DNA unwinding method, respectively. The DNA unwinding method showed that this compound did not induce DNA damage at concentrations &lt;7 ?g/ml. Alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis revealed approximately double the level of DNA damage (in comparison to untreated control DNA) at a concentration of 2 ?g/ml, which reduced proliferation to approximately 30%, and triple the level of DNA damage at higher concentrations (6 and 7 ?g/ml), which inhibited completely both DNA synthesis and proteosynthesis. Cells with moderately damaged DNA were more common than cells with heavily damaged DNA. Parallel experiments with the strong mutagen and carcinogen MNNG showed that MNNG induced in cells a high level of DNA damage at concentrations which did not reduce the mitotic index or proteosynthesis, while DNA synthesis inhibited only partially. After treatment with MNNG, cells with heavily damaged DNA were more common than cells with moderately damaged DNA. Duslin P-treated VH10 cells were also tested cytogenetically, confirming that Duslin P induced neither chromosomal aberrations nor aneuploidy. We conclude that Duslin P has no mutagenic effect on bacteria, does not induce chromosomal aberrations and CREST positive or CREST negative micronuclei in human cells and induces only a small increase of DNA damage in human cells which is consistent with DNA fragmentation due to cell death.", "label": 0}

Initially, toxin uptake was established as a function of dose by seeding serial toxin dilutions into small aquaria containing 4\u201310 cm goldfish (Carassius auratus). The possibility that gills or lateral lines were principal toxin entry points was ruled out by plugging fish oesophagi with a rubber-like, dental-impression compound. Toxin uptake was reduced nearly sixfold by this procedure. Water ingestion rates were measured by exposing groups of 8\u201310 cm fish for varying time intervals to a constant flow of water containing 0\u00b72% toxic supernatant from a botulinum culture. The potency of this supernatant was determined simultaneously in additional fish by intragastric inoculation.

Thermal resistance depended on the phage considered, but a marked heat-resistance was exhibited by one phage (Ib3) since its high titre suspensions were completely inactivated only after 45 min at 72 \u00b0C or 15 min at 90 \u00b0C. A clear protective effect of the milk was revealed when the three suspension media were compared. As regards to the effects of biocides on phages, only peracetic acid was found to be effective for inactivating high titre suspensions. Ethanol, even at a concentration of 100%, was not suitable to assure no surviving phage particles and isopropanol turned out to be less effective than ethanol. Sodium hypochlorite at 200\u2013400 ppm inactivated the phages completely, except phage Ib3, which was only destroyed after treatments with 1200 ppm.

The GTHMUS cDNA shares 93.7% nucleotide sequence identity with a human liver cDNA clone, GTH411, that is encoded as the GST1 locus. Comparison of the liver and muscle cDNA sequences shows two regions of remarkable sequence conservation: a 140-nucleotide region in the 5' coding portion of the mol. that has a single silent nucleotide substitution, and a 550-nucleotide region, including the entire 3' noncoding region, that has only 3 nucleotide substitutions or deletions.

To help control this pathogen in fresh produce, a better understanding of the interaction of human NoV and fresh produce needs to be established. In this study the attachment of human NoV and animal caliciviruses (murine norovirus, MNV-1; Tulane virus, TV) to fresh produce was evaluated, using both visualization and viral enumeration techniques. It was found that a human NoV GII.4 strain attached efficiently to the Romaine lettuce leaves and roots and green onion shoots, and that washing with PBS or 200 ppm of chlorine removed less than 0.4 log of viral RNA copies from the tissues. In contrast, TV and MNV-1 bound more efficiently to Romaine lettuce leaves than to the roots, and simple washing removed less than 1 log of viruses from the lettuce leaves and 1-4 log PFU of viruses from roots. Subsequently, the location of virus particles in fresh produce was visualized using a fluorescence-based Quantum Dots (Q-Dots) assay and confocal microscopy. It was found that human NoV virus-like particles (VLPs), TV, and MNV-1 associated with the surface of Romaine lettuce and were found aggregating in and around the stomata. In green onions, human NoV VLPs were found between the cells of the epidermis and cell walls of both the shoots and roots. However, TV and MNV-1 were found to be covering the surface of the epidermal cells in both the shoots and roots of green onions.

In this study, we characterized water quality in one study zone with continuous supply and three zones with intermittent supply in the drinking water distribution network in Arraij\u00e1n, Panama. Low or zero pressures occurred in all zones, and negative pressures occurred in the continuous zone and two of the intermittent zones. Despite hydraulic conditions that created risks for backflow and contaminant intrusion, only four of 423 (0.9%) grab samples collected at random times were positive for total coliform bacteria and only one was positive for E.\u00a0coli. Only nine of 496 (1.8%) samples had turbidity >1.0 NTU and all samples had ?0.2\u00a0mg/L free chlorine residual. In contrast, water quality was often degraded during the first-flush period (when supply first returned after an outage). Still, routine and first-flush water quality under intermittent supply was much better in Arraij\u00e1n than that reported in a previous study conducted in India. Better water quality in Arraij\u00e1n could be due to better water quality leaving the treatment plant, shorter supply outages, higher supply pressures, a more consistent and higher chlorine residual, and fewer contaminant sources near pipes. The results illustrate that intermittent supply and its effects on water quality can vary greatly between and within distribution networks. The study also demonstrated that monitoring techniques designed specifically for intermittent supply, such as continuous pressure monitoring and sampling the first flush, can detect water quality threats and degradation that would not likely be detected with conventional monitoring.", "label": 0}

Up till now there have been only limited reports dealing with the effect of decontamination on the respiration of lightly processed produce. In this paper water, sodium hypochlorite, neutral electrolysed oxidising water and peroxyacetic acid were evaluated for their effect on the respiration rate of fresh-cut vegetables such as carrot, iceberg lettuce, leek and white cabbage. Respiration rate measurements were done at 7 degrees C and 3% O-2 by means of the closed method. Following that, the influence of a packaging delay on the respiration rate of water washed and treated (80 mg/L peroxyacetic acid) carrot and white cabbage was examined. Sodium hypochlorite did not have a significant influence on the respiration rate of carrot, leek and cabbage, but increased that of iceberg lettuce from 0.30 to 0.46 mmol O-2/kg h. Washing leek and iceberg lettuce with peroxyacetic acid did not change the respiration rate, but decreased that of carrot and white cabbage to a level of less than half of its initial value. Apparently the respiration rate of fresh-cut produce with a large area of cut surfaces, was influenced by peroxyacetic acid decontamination. Grated carrots did not show any significant respiration after a treatment with 250 mg/L peroxyacetic acid. A treatment with neutral electrolysed oxidising water containing 30 mg/L free chlorine decreased the respiration of leek and white cabbage whereas with 5 mg/L it reduced the respiration of white cabbage only. During a packaging delay of 24 or 48 h a sharp increase in respiration of water washed vegetables as well as vegetables treated with peroxyacetic acid was observed. In general, besides the degree of cutting, other processing effects such as the type of sanitizer and the time between processing and packaging can have an influence on the respiration and must be taken into account when an appropriate packaging configuration needs to be designed for a specific commodity.

In this study, we have examined the drug and its analogs for their modes of interaction with the receptors, with a particular emphasis on finding molecular determinants for their functional properties. Changes in the substituents on N5 and C6 of the heterocyclic ring produced no major effects on binding characteristics but yielded drugs of widely varying efficacy (antagonist to full agonist), measured as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated 36Cl- uptake and t-butylbicyclophosphoro[35S]thionate binding in rat cerebrocortical membranes. The relative binding affinity and efficacy of the analogs measured in brain membranes were similar to those in cloned GABAA receptors of the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 (type I) and alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 (type II) subtypes. The imidazoquinoxalines showed no marked subtype selectivity. Their Ki value against [3H]flunitrazepam binding for type I was only 2-3 times lower than that for type II, and their rank order for agonistic activity was the same in the two subtypes, measured as GABA-mediated Cl- currents in human kidney cells (A293) expressing the subtypes of GABAA receptors. According to computational modeling of the drugs using both molecular and quantum mechanics, the agonistic activity of the imidazoquinoxaline derivatives depends on the presence of a bulky alkyl substituent at N5 and the deformation of the substituted portion of the otherwise planar ring system induced by a bulky moiety at N5 or C6. With a fixed N5 substituent (isopropyl), the relative efficacy in the brain membranes, as well as in the cloned receptors, appeared to be dependent on the degree of the ring deformation. This out-of-plane portion of the imidazoquinoxalines can be assigned to the general region occupied by the 5-phenyl group of diazepam and other agonistic functional groups of several nonbenzodiazepine ligands. It seems that this region, apparently common to various agonistic ligands, interacts with an agonistic pocket in type I and type II subtypes of the benzodiazepine receptors in the brain. Our results also provide direct support for the view that the agonists and nonagonists share largely overlapping binding regions in the benzodiazepine receptor, which has been proposed earlier from in vivo efficacy measurements of other series of ligands.", "label": 0}

There is little evidence regarding best practice for patients requiring surgical intervention. The aim of this multicentre study was to review our experience in patients requiring surgery for C. difficile colitis. Methods Patients who underwent surgery for C. difficile colitis in 5 hospitals in Southeast England over a 7-year period (1 teaching hospital and 4 district general hospitals) were identified from histopathology databases. Data were collected regarding the presentation, indication for surgery and post-operative outcomes. Results 15 patients (9 males; mean age = 71 years (range 35\u201384 years)) underwent surgery. 46% of patients (n = 7) contracted C. difficile during their hospital admission for other medical reasons and 73% of patients were initially admitted under other medical specialties. Diagnosis was only made preoperatively in 8 patients (53%). Indications for surgery were peritonitis and systemic toxicity (n = 12), failure of medical management (n = 2) and unresolving large bowel dilatation (n = 1). 12 patients underwent total colectomy and the rest underwent segmental resection. All patients were admitted to the intensive care unit post operatively with a mean stay of 6 days. 2 patients needed a second look laparotomy.

In this work, a hydantoin derivative, 3-monomethylol-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (MDMH), was grafted onto the nascent aromatic polyamide membrane surfaces by the reactions with active groups (e.g., acyl chloride groups) in the surfaces. The grafted MDMH moieties with high reaction activity and free chlorine could play as sacrificial pendant groups when membranes suffer from chlorine attacks, and the chlorination products N-halamines with strong antimicrobial function could sterilize microorganisms on membrane surfaces and then regenerate to MDMH. This was designed as a novel means to improve both chlorine resistances and anti-biofouling properties of the aromatic polyamide TFC RO membranes. Attenuated total reflectance mode Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) revealed that the MDMH-modified membranes had two characteristic bands at 1772 and 1709 cm-1 corresponding to two carbonyl groups in hydantoin ring. This suggested the successful grafting of MDMH onto the membrane surfaces, which was further confirmed and quantified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. After modification with MDMH, the membrane surface hydrophilicity increased obviously as contact angles decreased from 57.7\u00b0 to 50.4-31.5\u00b0. But, there was no obvious change in membrane surface roughness after modification. The MDMH-modified membranes were shown to possess high chlorine resistances with small changes in water fluxes and salt rejections after chlorination with 100-2000 ppm h chlorine at pH 4. The chlorinated MDMH-modified membranes demonstrated obvious sterilization effects on Escherchia coli and substantial preventions against microbial fouling. Therefore, the MDMH-modified membranes offer a potential use as a new type of chlorine resistance and anti-biofouling TFC RO membranes. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "label": 0}

Electrolytically generated Cu and Ag ions at low levels, in addition to very low chlorine concentrations, have been suggested as an alternative to routine chlorination. We have examined the combination of Cu and Ag ions with low levels of iodine. Pseudomonas cepacia was grown either in rich medium or under nutrient restriction prior to disinfection. Survival of the organism and its ability to regrow after treatment as well as the effects of varying buffers, metal ion and iodine concentrations were determined. Low concentrations of metal ions (100 ppb Cu and 11 ppb Ag) and iodine (200 ppb) were more effective than either metal ions or iodine alone against Ps. cepacia grown on rich agar or in low nutrient buffer. After iodination, buffer-grown suspensions recovered to their original cell concentrations within 7 d. When Cu and Ag ions were used with or without iodine, regrowth was prevented. The results show that low concentrations of Cu and Ag in combination with iodine permit effective disinfection of bacteria after cultivation on either rich media or under nutrient restriction.

We tested the SSM with a widely introduced fish Gambusia holbrooki (Girard) (Pisces, Poeciliidae) and the std. lab. test species Daphnia magna Straus (Crustacea, Daphniidae). The stress was simulated by short-term exposure to acid mine drainage (AMD) and to acidified ref. water (ACID). Recording of behavioral responses with the multispecies freshwater biomonitor (MFB) generated continuous time-dependent dose-response data that were modeled in three-dimensional (3D) surface plots. Both the pH-dependent mortalities and the strong linear correlations between pH and aq. metals confirmed the toxicity of the AMD and ACID gradients, resp., for fish and Daphnia, the latter being more sensitive. AMD stress at pH ? 5.5 amplified circadian rhythmicity in both species, while ACID stress did so only in G. holbrooki. A behavioral stepwise stress response was found in both species: D. magna decreased locomotion and ventilation (first step) (AMD, ACID), followed by increased ventilation (second step) (AMD). G. holbrooki decreased locomotion (first step) (AMD, ACID) and increased ventilation at intermediate pH levels (second step) (AMD). Both species, although from different taxonomic groups and feeding habits, followed the SSM, which might be expanded to a general concept for describing the behavioral responses of aquatic organisms to pollution. Stepwise stress responses might be applied in online biomonitors to provide more sensitive and graduated alarm settings, hence optimizing the \"early warning\" detection of pollution waves.

Beef was contaminated with an Escherichia coli O157:H7 isolate with known minimum inhibitory concentration against lactic acid (0.09% v/v), then wrapped with the lactic-acid polyamide film and vacuum packaged. During storage at 12 \u00b0C, the numbers of E. coli were 1 log unit lower than that of a control (untreated polyamide film) and decreased by an additional 1 log during storage for 14 days.", "label": 0}
{"id": "2537", "title": "N-Halamine modified thermoplastic polyurethane with rechargeable antimicrobial function for food contact surface", "abstract": "A polymer blend of two N-halamine precursors was prepd. and homogeneously incorporated into TPU structure via a solvent casting method, and an N-halamine modified TPU film with rechargeable antimicrobial activity resulted after treating with chlorine bleach. Antimicrobial efficacies were evaluated against both Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli). Results showed that the N-halamine modified TPU film caused 6 log CFU redn. of bacteria redn. within 2 h of contact. Moreover, the N-halamine modified TPU displayed desirable rechargeability and stability, which maintained sufficient antimicrobial activity after 20 cycles of \"discharge-recharge\" process and over 4 wk of storage. Besides, the tensile strength and surface tension of TPU were not adversely affected by N-halamine modification. The N-halamine modified TPU with rechargeable antimicrobial function exhibited great potential as a cheap, safe and effective food contact surface material for preventing food microbial cross-contamination.

Clinical infection caused by C meningosepticum is very rare among healthy adults. We present the case of a patient with end-stage renal disease who developed purulent pericarditis with C meningosepticum infection, which rapidly evolved into cardiac tamponade and death. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which C meningosepticum caused fatal purulent pericarditis in a hemodialysis patient.", "label": 0}
{"id": "6765", "title": "New agents for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia", "abstract": "The heterogeneity of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been established by many new insights into the diagnosis, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, treatment, and prognosis of patients with AML. Morphology remains the foundation for the diagnosis. However, additional diagnostic studies, including immunophenotyping, cytogenetic evaluation, and molecular genetic studies, are necessary to develop treatments because specific subtypes of AML can now be approached with targeted therapy. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), defined by a single molecular abnormality, is now treated with specific targeted therapy, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and this subtype of AML is now highly curable. Currently, a number of agents have been explored in AML, including anti-CD33 antibodies and immunoconjugate drugs, inhibitors of multidrug resistance proteins, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-Bcl-2 transcription agents, and inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). New alkylating agents, and purine analogs such as Cloretazine and clofarabine, affect DNA and ribonucleoside reductases, respectively. These agents have shown promise in small studies. Large phase III studies will address whether these are effective in inducing complete responses. Combining targeted agents with chemotherapy may improve the response rates. The plan for the future is to find therapeutic strategies that are specific for patients based on the specific biology of the disease. Future studies will investigate combinations of targeted therapies with each other and with chemotherapies to maximize the inhibition of multiple pathways present in AML. Additionally, evaluation of the identified prognostic factors and gene mutations will enable further pathologic classification of patients with AML.", "label": 0}
{"id": "4646", "title": "Effects of X-ray treatments on pathogenic bacteria, inherent microflora, color, and firmness on whole cantaloupe", "abstract": "Inactivation of inoculated Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica and Shigella flexneri on whole cantaloupes using X-ray at different doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 kGy) was studied. The effect of X-ray on quality parameters (color and texture) of untreated and treated whole cantaloupes was instrumentally determined. The effect of X-ray on microflora counts (mesophilic counts, psychrotrophic counts and yeast and mold counts) of untreated and treated whole cantaloupes was also determined during storage at 22 \u00b0C for 20 days. A mixture of three strains of each tested organism was spot inoculated (100 ?l), separately, onto the surface (5 cm2) of cantaloupe rinds (approximately 8\u20139 log CFU ml? 1) separately, air dried (60 min), and then treated with X-ray at 22 \u00b0C and 55% relative humidity. Surviving bacterial populations on cantaloupe surfaces were evaluated using a nonselective medium (tryptic soy agar) with a selective medium overlay for each bacterium; E. coli O157:H7 (CT-SMAC agar), L. monocytogenes (MOA), and S. enterica and S. flexneri (XLD). More than a 5 log CFU reduction was achieved after treatment with 2.0 kGy X-ray, for all tested pathogens. No significant effect of X-ray treatment on cantaloupe color or firmness was detected. Furthermore, treatment with X-ray significantly reduced the initial inherent microflora on whole cantaloupes and inherent levels were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower than the control sample throughout storage for 20 days.", "label": 0}

This class of antibacterials exhibits Gram-positive activity, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus. We define the structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) of this class of antibiotics with the synthesis and evaluation of a series of 59 derivatives with variations in the C ring or C and D rings. A total of 17 compounds showed activity against S. aureus. Four derivatives were evaluated against a panel of 16 Gram-positive strains, inclusive of several methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains. These compounds are broadly active against Gram-positive bacteria.", "label": 0}
