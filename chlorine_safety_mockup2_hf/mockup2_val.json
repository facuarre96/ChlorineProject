{"id": "8210", "title": "Genotypic differentiation in the stomatal response to salinity and contrasting photosynthetic and photoprotection responses in five olive (Olea europaea L.) cultivars", "abstract": "Olive tree is moderately tolerant to salinity. Differences in salt tolerance among olive tree cultivars are documented. Salt-mediated decreases of stomatal conductance and photosynthesis are common in the studied cultivars, but other photosynthetic characteristics in response to increasing salinity are much less investigated. Greenhouse expts. were conducted to investigate the responses to increasing salinity up to 200 mM NaCl of five olive tree cultivars: Chemlali', Chetoui', Arbequina I18', Arbosana I43' and Koroneiki', widely used in Tunisia. Techniques used include detns. of leaf concns. of the toxic ions Na and Cl, photosynthetic pigment analyses, gas exchange and chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence measurements. Relationships between thermal energy dissipation and changes in pigment compn. were investigated. With 100 mM NaCl water, the most readily available water in arid regions of Tunisia, Chemlali', Chetoui' and Arbosana' grew similarly to control plants, which is a valuable information for horticultural purposes. In all cultivars, leaf Na and Cl concns. increased and net CO2 assimilation rates decreased as salt concn. increased. A neg. correlation was obsd. between photosynthesis and leaf thickness. Data revealed genotypic differentiation in the stomatal response to salinity, decreasing in Koroneiki', Arbequina' and Arbosana' but remaining fairly const. in Chemlali' and Chetoui'. In those cultivars where the amt. of energy thermally dissipated increased in response to salinity, it was well correlated with increases of (zeaxanthin + antheraxanthin)/(violaxanthin + antheraxanthin + zeaxanthin) ((Z + A)/(V + A + Z)) and lutein to Chl molar ratios. In summary, salinity caused marked redns. in photosynthetic rates well correlated with leaf Na and Cl accumulation. Photosynthesis limitation was partially attributed to stomata closure, except in the cultivars Chemlali' and Chetoui' in which stomatal conductances were unaltered. Possible decrease of CO2 mesophyll conductance mediated by increases of leaf thickness is discussed. Salinity increased Z+A- and/or lutein-mediated thermal energy dissipation of some of the olive tree cultivars investigated. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}
{"id": "1229", "title": "Purification of breast cancer resistance protein ABCG2 and role of arginine-482", "abstract": "Human ABCG2 was efficiently overexpressed in insect cell membranes, solubilized with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethyl ammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, and purified through N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Its functionality was assessed by high vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity, and nucleotide-binding capacity. Interestingly, the R482T point mutation increased both maximal hydrolysis rate and affinity for MgATP, and lowered sensitivity to vanadate inhibition. Direct nucleotide binding, as monitored by quenching of intrinsic fluorescence, indicated a mutation-related preference for ATP over ADP. The R482T mutation only produced a limited change, if any, on the binding of drug substrates, indicating that methotrexate, on the one hand, and rhodamine 123 or doxorubicin, on the other hand, bound similarly to wildtype and mutant transporters whether or not they were subject to cellular transport. In addition, the characteristic inhibitors GF120918 and 6-prenylchrysin, which alter mitoxantrone efflux much better for wild-type than mutant ABCG2, bound similarly to purified ABCG2, while the highly-potent Ko143 bound in the nanomolar range also effective in inhibition of drug transport. All results indicate that the role of the arginine-482 mutation on substrate drug transport and inhibitor efficiency is not mediated by changes in drug binding. © Birkhäuser Verlag, 2006.", "label": 0}
{"id": "5254", "title": "Risk assessment case study - Chloroform and related substances", "abstract": "Chlorine, used as an important disinfectant for drinking water, can react with naturally occurring organic matter to form chloroform, bromodichloromethane, chlorodibromomethane and bromofonn. Chloroform and other trihalomethanes have been shown to increase tumours of the liver. kidney or large intestine in rats or mice. The risk to man from these contaminants must be assessed carefully since there is considerable benefit associated with the use of chlorine. The weight of evidence suggests that chloroform is non-genotoxic and there are data, for each site, to indicate that rumours only occur at high doses where there is also tissue damage. Bromodichloromethane has also been shown to increase liver and kidney tumours but this and bromoform have been shown to increase large intestinal rumours in rats. The weight of evidence is that they are only weak genotoxins and they do not appear to be active in vivo. It is probable that the mechanism for the liver and kidney rumours is the same as for chloroform but the mechanism for the large intestinal tumours is uncertain. However, the toxicity and carcinogenicity of these substances is profoundly affected by dosing in corn oil. New studies suggest that dosing in drinking water would not result in increases in rumours. The evidence suggests that the use of a threshold approach, based on a tolerable daily intake, would be the most appropriate way of determining safe levels in drinking water.

Swimming has constructive effects on human physical and mental health care and lack of proper sanitation and disinfection Regulations of water in swimming pools is led to health problems and infectious disease transmission among swimmers. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the results of swimming pools in Kermanshah with the national standards. This study was descriptive-sectional and carried out in 2016 in 24 active pools in Kermanshah city by collecting statistics. In the survey in addition of the characterization of Public Pools Through interviews, heterotrophic bacteria, fecal coliforms, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and physicochemical parameters such as residual chlorine, turbidity were assessed in the sampling sites and were recorded in the relevant forms. All calculations were performed with SPSS software (version 16) and statistical significance was considered 0.05. The results showed that from 99 samples in 15.2% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has exceeded the standard level. In addition, 17.2% Staphylococcus aureus, 15.2% and the amount of fecal coliform, 17.2% bacteria heterotroph and 17.2% of residual chlorine levels were out of the standard limit. According on the results, residua chlorine, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fecal coliform, heterotroph bacteria indicators had the minimum compliance with standard levels which indicates the need for continuous monitoring of physical, chemical and biological indicators of water as well as filtration and disinfection of water. It also recommended alternative antibiotics.", "label": 0}
{"id": "5850", "title": "Disinfection of selected vegetables under nonthermal treatments: Chlorine, acid citric, ultraviolet light and ozone", "abstract": "Lettuce, tomatoes and carrots were evaluated under four disinfection methods. Chlorine (50, 100 and 200 ppm) was compared for effectiveness with citric acid (0.5, 1 and 1.5%), UV light (UV-C) (0.65 and 1.6 mW/cm2) and ozone (5 ppm) to inactivate Escherichia coli ATCC 11775. Processing times were from 3 min up to 60 min. Hunter color parameters, color functions (ΔE, hue, chroma), tomato color index (TCI) and whiteness index (WI) were evaluated after disinfection. Results showed that citric acid was not effective for inactivation of E. coli at the tested conditions. UV-C was effective in the inactivation of the microorganism when fluence was higher, being more effective in the smooth surface of tomato (2.7 log). Meanwhile, ozone was also able to inactivate bacteria in tomatoes (2.2 log) after only 3 min. Carrots and lettuce showed lower inactivation for all treatments because of their porous and roughened surfaces. UV-C was the treatment that most affected the color of the produce; it generated browning of lettuce, and increase of TCI and WI of carrots. Ozone also affected the greenness of lettuce. Concn., dose and processing times of novel disinfection methods need to be evaluated not only for microbial counts, but also sensory properties. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}
{"id": "7100", "title": "Presence of Trihalomethanes in ready-to-eat vegetables disinfected with chlorine", "abstract": "Trihalomethanes (THMs) - CHCl3, CHCl2Br, CHClBr2 and CHBr3 - are drinking water disinfection by-products (DBPs). These compounds can also be absorbed by different types of foods, including ready-to-eat (RTE) fresh vegetables. The potential absorption of THMs during washing of RTE vegetables could pose a potential risk to consumers' health. The concentration of THMs in the water used in the manufacturing process of these products shall not exceed the limit of 100 or 80 mu gL(-1) according to European Union (EU) and United States legislation, respectively. By contrast, there is little information about the presence of such compounds in the final product. This study evaluated the concentration of THMs in different types of RTE vegetables (carrots, iceberg lettuce, lettuce, mixed salad, parsley, parsley and garlic, rocket salad, valerian) after washing with chlorinated water. In the 115 samples analysed, the average value of total THMs was equal to 76.7 ng g(-1). Chloroform was the THM present in the largest percentage in all the RTE vegetables. These results show that the process of washing RTE vegetables should be optimised in order to reduce the risk for consumers associated with the presence of DBPs.", "label": 0}
{"id": "2810", "title": "Bacterial contamination of keyboards: efficacy and functional impact of disinfectants", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Computers are ubiquitous in the healthcare setting and have been shown to be contaminated with potentially pathogenic microorganisms. This study was performed to determine the degree of microbial contamination, the efficacy of different disinfectants, and the cosmetic and functional effects of the disinfectants on the computer keyboards. METHODS: We assessed the effectiveness of 6 different disinfectants (1 each containing chlorine, alcohol, or phenol and 3 containing quaternary ammonium) against 3 test organisms (oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [ORSA], Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species) inoculated onto study computer keyboards. We also assessed the computer keyboards for functional and cosmetic damage after disinfectant use. RESULTS: Potential pathogens cultured from more than 50% of the computers included coagulase-negative staphylococci (100% of keyboards), diphtheroids (80%), Micrococcus species (72%), and Bacillus species (64%). Other pathogens cultured included ORSA (4% of keyboards), OSSA (4%), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus species (12%), and nonfermentative gram-negative rods (36%). All disinfectants, as well as the sterile water control, were effective at removing or inactivating more than 95% of the test bacteria. No functional or cosmetic damage to the computer keyboards was observed after 300 disinfection cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that microbial contamination of keyboards is prevalent and that keyboards may be successfully decontaminated with disinfectants. Keyboards should be disinfected daily or when visibly soiled or if they become contaminated with blood.", "label": 0}
{"id": "8713", "title": "Effects of UV treatment on biological fouling in a California aqueduct", "abstract": "The East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) operates six water treatment plants throughout the East Bay in California. The primary source water is snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada collected at the Pardee Reservoir. The water travels from the reservoir through 90 mi of aqueduct before reaching either immediate treatment or subsequent storage at one of several terminal reservoirs. EBMUD is interested in lowering total trihalomethane (THM) levels and haloacetic acid (HAA) levels in its treated water. An important mechanism leading to the formation of these disinfection byproducts (DBPs) is the application of chlorine in aqueduct water to suppress biofilm. Biofilm control is crit. to mitigate headloss and biocorrosion in the aqueduct. A potential method of controlling biofouling while minimizing THM and HAA formation would be to replace free chlorine with UV light as primary disinfection. The focus of this project was to det. the effectiveness of UV treatment on its own and in combination with free chlorine (Cl2) and chlorine dioxide (ClO2) in suppressing biofilm growth in aqueduct water. The study also assessed DBP concns. and the potential for UV to reduce chem. disinfectants. To simulate the aqueduct, eight annular reactors (ARs) were set up at the Pardee Reservoir. It was shown that chlorine dioxide in combination with UV treatment was most effective at controlling heterotrophic bacterial levels in the ARs. All ARs pre-treated with UV had higher log removal than when ARs were only disinfected chem. Pretreatment with UV did not lower the required chem. dose to reach the goal effluent residual in ARs treated with ClO2 or Cl2. However, on av. TTHM and HAA levels were lower in those ARs dosed with chlorine and pre-treated with UV compared to those treated with Cl2 disinfection only. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

It is revealed that chlorination of the A-ring has a profound effect on activity. Moreover, di-chlorination of the 6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline structure results in a 10-fold increase in potency compared to capsazepine.", "label": 0}
{"id": "6974", "title": "Water quality of swimming pools in Athens area", "abstract": "A representative sample of 11 indoor and outdoor swimming pools were studied with respect to crit. physicochem., health-related, microbiol. and tech. parameters. These pools were used either as competition (athletic) or recreation pools. Useful correlations of the above parameters were deduced and properly attributed. Results, checked against well-established stds. such as DIN 19643, showed poor compliance with them in all studied parameters. Thus, compliance for health-related parameters was 0-100%; 20-100% for phys. and chem. parameters; 45-91% for microbiol. parameters; and 27-36% for tech. parameters. The most crit. parameters implicated for poor water quality were redox potential, turbidity, and the appearance of certain opportunistic pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). These were attributed to poor process design of pools and lack of sufficient vocational training of the tech. personnel operating water treatment installations. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}
