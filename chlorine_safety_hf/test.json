The use of a combined PB/beta NF induction regime using oral dosing is therefore considered to be a suitable substitute for Aroclor 1254.", "label": 0}

The primary aim of this study was to compare efficacy of the B.17 and ILM formulations in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). A secondary aim was to determine if dietary alterations could enhance the immune response and/or elicit greater levels of protection. Therefore, a basal diet (BioOlympic fry diet; control feed) and an immunostimulatory diet (BioPro; IS feed) were fed to rainbow trout at 2% body weight (bwt) per day for 2 weeks prior to immersion immunization with the B.17 vaccine, ILM vaccine, or a TYES media control. A booster immunization was administered two weeks post initial vaccination, and feeding of the respective feeds continued for one additional week at which time all groups received the control diet until the end of the experiment. In trial 1, an acute chlorine spike occurred just prior to pathogen challenge (week 7) resulting in substantial mortality among treatment groups. Interestingly, fish fed the IS feed had significantly lower mortality (36.7%) than fish fed the control feed (67%). Vaccinated fish had significantly higher antibody titers than the control fish at week 2 through 7 in trial 1. In trial 2, antibody titers for all vaccinated fish were significantly greater than controls at week 4, but at weeks 6 and 8 the titers of B.17 vaccinated fish were not significantly different from controls. However, average titers for ILM vaccinated were significantly greater than control fish at weeks 6 and 8. Cumulative percent mortality (CPM) in B.17 and ILM vaccinated groups was significantly lower than control groups at the point where CPM reached 60% (mid-way through outbreak), but by the end of the challenge (28 days) ILM vaccinated fish had significantly lower CPM than either control or B.17 vaccinated fish. When comparing dietary effects, CPM was not significantly different but RPS values for fish fed the BioPro IS feed were consistently elevated over groups fed the control diet regardless of the vaccine formulation administered. This study demonstrates increased efficacy of the ILM vaccine in rainbow trout, and provides evidence that a commercial \u201chealth enhancing\u201d diet can provide benefits in response to an acute stress event and may contribute to increased vaccine performance. Statement of relevance This manuscript addresses an important and very practical problem in aquaculture. Coldwater disease is a major disease affecting salmonid aquaculture around the world. There is no approved vaccine available in the US. This manuscript reports the beneficial effects of feeding commercial immunostimulatory functional feeds on the efficacy of two formulations of a coldwater disease vaccine. The results presented here are highly relevant to the development of aquaculture and finding sustainable and non-antibiotic based aquatic animal health management strategies. This study will contribute towards coldwater disease management and identifies potential benefits of commercial functional feeds commonly used in the aquaculture industry.", "label": 0}

To assess OCV acceptability and knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) regarding cholera and WaSH, we conducted cross-sectional surveys, 1 month before (baseline) and 3 and 12 months after (first and second follow-up) a preemptive OCV campaign in Maela, a long-standing refugee camp on the Thailand-Burma border. We randomly selected households for the surveys, and administered questionnaires to female heads of households. In total, 271 (77%), 187 (81%), and 199 (85%) households were included in the baseline, first and second follow-up surveys, respectively. Anticipated OCV acceptability was 97% at baseline, and 91% and 85% of household members were reported to have received 1 and 2 OCV doses at first follow-up. Compared with baseline, statistically significant differences (95% Wald confidence interval not overlapping zero) were noted at first and second follow-up among the proportions of respondents who correctly identified two or more means of cholera prevention (62% versus 78% and 80%), reported boiling or treating drinking water (19% versus 44% and 69%), and washing hands with soap (66% versus 77% and 85%); a significant difference was also observed in the proportion of households with soap available at handwashing areas (84% versus 90% and 95%), consistent with reported behaviors. No significant difference was noted in the proportion of households testing positive for Escherichia coli in stored household drinking water at second follow-up (39% versus 49% and 34%). Overall, we observed some positive, and no negative changes in cholera- and WaSH-related KAPs after an OCV campaign in Maela refugee camp. OCV campaigns may provide opportunities to reinforce beneficial WaSH-related KAPs for comprehensive cholera prevention and control.", "label": 0}

Compared with other Brazilian species of Bothrops, the toxinology of B. insularis is still poorly understood, and so far, no fraction from this venom with amino acid oxidase activity had been isolated or its biological activity tested. We investigated the biochemical and biological effects of one l-amino acid oxidase enzyme isolated from B. insularis snake venom (BiLAO), which was purified using HPLC and sequence grade. We also evaluated the renal effects induced by BiLAO. Chromatographic profile of B. insularis whole venom disclosed seven main fractions (I, II, III, IV, V, VI and VII) and the main LAO enzymatic activity was detected in fraction II. The group treated with BiLAO showed a decrease in perfusion pressure (C(120)=110.28+/-3.69; BiLAO(120)=82.2+/-5.6 mmHg*); renal vascular resistance (C(120)=5.48+/-0.53; BiLAO(120)=4.12+/-0.42 mmHg/mL/g/min*), urinary flow (C(120)=0.160+/-0.020; BiLAO(120)=0.064+/-0.012 mL/g/min*), glomerular filtration rate (C(120)=0.697+/-0.084; BiLAO(120)=0.176+/-0.017 mL/g/min*), sodium (C(120)=79.76+/-0.56; BiLAO(120)=65.39+/-6.19%*), potassium (C(120)=69.94+/-6.86; BiLAO(120)=60.26+/-2.24%*) and chloride tubular reabsortion (C(120)=78.53+/-2.33; BiLAO(120)=64.58+/-6.68%*). Acute tubular necrosis foci were observed in the group treated with the LAO fraction of the B. insularis snake venom. Some findings have the same morphological aspect of apoptosis, more evident cortically; otherwise, reversible degenerative phenomena represented by hydropic ballooning with extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization and discontinuity of the cell brush borders in the proximal tubular epithelium were observed; furthermore, necrotic detachment of these cells into the tubular lumina, and increased amount of protein deposits in the distal and proximal tubules were observed. In conclusion, the slowness of blood flow and of glomerular filtration resulted in more time for filtration and tubular reabsorption, with elevation of the total percentage of sodium and chlorine reabsorption. The maintenance of the decrease in glomerular filtration rate would determine the subsequent decreases, which were noticed in these parameters. The necrosis observed was the result of damage cell induced by l-amino acid oxidase isolated from B. insularis venom.", "label": 0}

Several reasons for disinfection problems were previously investigated. This paper describes the results of a study of two factors that could affect disinfection in this plant: (1) the potential for the development of disinfection-resistant fecal coliforms in the operation of this specific WWTP and (2) the nature of the wastewater matrix that this particular WWTP handles that could interfere with chlorine disinfection. The study suggested that the WWTP oxidation towers supported growth or recovery of fecal coliform bacteria. This bacterial subpopulation seemed to have increased resistance to routine chlorine disinfection. Inactivation rate constants calculated for periods between 15 and 45 minutes after chlorine addition were significantly lower for fecal coliforms originating from oxidation towers than for fecal coliforms from other sources. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of such conditions created by a treatment process. The study of the plant-specific matrix determined no statistically significant effects on disinfection.", "label": 1}

Mean oxygen consumption and Cl- uptake by PMNL were stimulated by both pilate (P+) and non-pilate (P-) gonococci, although the levels were much reduced in the presence of P+ organisms. P+ gonococci also initiated low levels of polarisation or depolarisation in contrast with P- cells, which caused hyperpolarisation followed by depolarisation in the PMNL. Most of the strains showed these patterns. High performance liquid chromatography of extracts of unstimulated PMNL and of PMNL challenged with gonococci confirmed production of hypochlorous acid (HOC1) in the leucocyte. Furthermore, addition of radiolabelled Cl- to the PMNLs showed that some of the Cl- taken up by the cells in response to gonococcal challenge was incorporated into the HOC1, suggesting a direct relationship between stimulation of Cl- uptake and production of active chlorine compounds in the leucocyte.", "label": 0}

Waterborne outbreaks of NoV are commonly reported. A novel GII.17 NoV strain emerged as a major cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks in China during the winter of 2014/2015. During this time, an outbreak of gastroenteritis occurred at a hotel in a ski park in Hebei Province, China. Epidemiological investigations indicated that one water well, which had only recently been in use, was the probable source. GII.17 NoV was detected by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from samples taken from cases, from concentrated water samples from water well, and from the nearby sewage settling tank. Nucleotide sequences of NoV extracted from clinical and water specimens were genetically identical and had 99\u00a0% homology with Beijing/CHN/2015. All epidemiological data indicated that GII.17 NoV was responsible for this outbreak. This is the first reported laboratory-confirmed waterborne outbreak caused by GII.17 NoV genotype in China.

Container-grown 'Bridal Pink' roses (on R. manetti rootstock) in a peat moss-based growing medium were irrigated, using moderate leaching fractions (25 % targeted, 37.5 % actual), with complete nutrient solutions supplemented with NaCl at 0, 5, and 10 mm. These salt concentrations affected the electrical conductivity (EC) and C1 concentrations measured in the leachates, but had no significant effects on flower yield and quality over four growth and flowering flushes (approximate to29 weeks). Cumulative yields over this period increased an average of approximate to13% per leachate EC unit. Thereafter, the applied NaCl concentrations were increased 3-fold to 0, 15, and 30 mm and the plants continued to be evaluated for another four flowering flushes. No significant differences in cut-flower yield and quality were observed among salt treatments despite further increases in leachate EC and Na and Cl concentrations. Symptoms of salt injury were visually observed during the last three flowering cycles, and most heavily on the oldest foliage of plants receiving the highest salt concentration (30 mm), but not on the foliage of harvested shoots. The concentration of most nutrients in leaf tissue was not significantly affected by any of the treatments over the course of the experiment. Leaf Na concentrations were not affected by NaCl applications, averaging 42 mg(.)kg(-1) across treatments. Conversely, leaf Cl concentrations increased significantly and cumulatively over time with salt additions, and ranged from 1.0 to 17.5 g(.)kg(-1) (0.1 to 1.75%).

The results point out a net variability of bacterial biofilm susceptibility according to the nutrients present. Chlorine and monochloramine showed an equal biocidal activity on lactose medium-grown E. coli ATCC 10536 and glycerol-ammonium nitrate medium-grown nonmucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. In contrast, the effect of monochloramine is greater compared with that of chlorine on E. coli and mucoid P. aeruginosa biofilms grown in sucrose and glycerol-ammonium nitrate media, respectively. In these culture conditions, treatment with 25 mg monochloramine/L for 2 h reduced culturable cells by 4.5 logs (99.997%) for E. coli and about 3 logs (99.87%) for mucoid P. aeruginosa while the similar treatment with chlorine reduced culturable cells in these biofilms by 2.2 logs (99.4%) and 1 log (10%), respectively. The decrease of chlorine disinfection efficacy on sucrose and glycerol-ammonium nitrate medium-grown biofilms is postulated to be linked to the higher polysaccharide production observed in these media. It seems likely that monochloramine produces a high leakage of material absorbing at 260 nm from sucrose medium-grown E. coli biofilm, which could indicate its better penetration into biofilms.", "label": 1}

The inactivation rate of FE was higher than that of PAE and the reactivation ratio of PAE was higher than that of FE, indicating the threat of particle-Associated bacteria. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to determine the factors influencing the disinfection efficiency of ClO2 in inactivating PAE. The experimental results indicated that particle concentration was a principal factor influencing the PAE inactivation efficiency, presenting a negative correlation, while exposure time and ClO2 dosage revealed a positive correlation. The inactivation kinetics of PAE using ClO2 was also investigated and the results demonstrated that PAE inactivation with ClO2 fitted the Chick-Watson kinetic model. The inactivation rate constants of PAE were found to follow the Arrhenius expression with an activation energy of 107.5 kJ/mol, indicating a relatively strong temperature dependence. However, there are minor effects of pH and initial ClO2 dosage on PAE inactivation rate constant.", "label": 0}

Conventionally practiced dechlorination with sulfite reduces the most refractory organic chloramines too slowly to produce wastewater effluents that meet current ecosystem protection criteria in the United States (i.e. total residual chlorine < or =0.011mg Cl(2)/L in freshwaters). Seeking faster dechlorinating agents, we have measured the rates that four test chloramines (NH(2)Cl, N-Cl-piperidine, N-Cl-leucylalanine and N-Cl-alanylalanine) react with 10 selected reducing agents at pH 7.4 and pH 8.4. The aqueous-phase reducing agents that offer speed advantages over sulfite alone include dithionite, thiosulfate, and iodide-mediated sulfite. Ascorbic acid was the most reactive of the sulfur-free agents but was found to be slow relative to sulfite. The potential biological oxygen demand might constrain the choice of aqueous reductants. Metallic iron is shown to reduce inorganic and organic chloramines effectively.

In the present study, the effect of Na and/or Cl application on the reduction and assimilation of nitrate in S. salsa was examined by growing plants in nutrient solutions with the following four treatments: -Na center dot-Cl, +Na center dot-Cl, -Na center dot+Cl and +Na center dot+Cl at 5 mol m(-3). Growth was stimulated by the application of Cl, but not Na. The total amount of nitrogen absorbed did not differ among treatments. However, nitrate accumulation in the plant, particularly in the stem, was much higher in the -Na center dot-Cl and +Na center dot-Cl treatments than in the -Na center dot+Cl and +Na center dot+Cl treatments. In contrast, the accumulation of crude protein in all plant tissues and of amino acids in the leaves was higher in the -Na center dot+Cl and +Na center dot+Cl treatments than in the -Na center dot-Cl and +Na center dot-Cl treatments. Thus, nitrate reduction and assimilation were stimulated by Cl application, irrespective of Na application. Increased nitrate reduction was considered to be the main cause of the increased nitrate assimilation induced by Cl.

Ca2+-sequestration by these intracellular organelles was determined using radioactive 45CaCl2. All three mixtures studied, Aroclor 1016, Aroclor 1254 and Aroclor 1260, were equally potent in inhibiting microsomal and mitochondrial Ca2+-sequestration with IC50 values of 6-8 microM. 1,2,3,7,8-Pentachlorodibenzofuran had no effect on Ca2+-sequestration by these organelles. The SAR among the congeners revealed: (1) congeners with ortho-/meta- or ortho-, para-chlorine substitutions were the most potent in inhibiting microsomal and mitochondrial Ca2+-sequestration (IC50 = 2.4-22.3 microM); (2) congeners with only para- but without ortho-substitutions were not effective in inhibiting Ca2+-sequestration by microsomes and mitochondria; (3) increased chlorination was not related to the effectiveness of these congeners.

The most important target for keeping overall quality of these commodities is a decrease in microbial spoilage flora as these cause both decay and safety problems. Every step in the production chain will influence microbial load and the implementation of an accurate disinfection program should be the main concern of commercial processing. The only step that reduces microbial load throughout the production chain is washing disinfection, and the keys are proper handling and optimizing existing techniques or a combination of them. Chlorine is a common efficient sanitation agent but there is the risk of undesirable by-products upon reaction with organic matter and this may lead to new regulatory restrictions in the future. Moreover, its efficacy is poor for some products. Consequently the minimal processing industry wants safer alternatives. Several antimicrobial washing solutions, O(3), UV-C radiation, intense light pulses, super high O(2), N(2)O and noble gases, alone or in combination, are presently considered promising treatments.

The seed used for sprouting appears to be the primary source of these pathogens. The aim of this study was to determine whether the efficacy of commercial citrus-related products for sanitizing sprouting seed is similar to that of high levels of chlorine. Five products (Citrex, Pangermex, Citricidal, Citrobio, and Environne) were tested at concentrations of up to 20,000 ppm in sterile tap water and compared with buffered chlorine (at 16,000 ppm). Alfalfa seeds were inoculated with four-strain cocktails of Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 to give final initial concentrations of ca. 9.0 and 7.0 CFU/g, respectively. Treatments (10 min) with Citrex, Pangermex, and Citricidal at 20,000 ppm and chlorine at 16,000 ppm produced similar log reductions for alfalfa seed inoculated with four-strain cocktails of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella (3.42 to 3.46 log CFU/g and 3.56 to 3.74 log CFU/g, respectively), and all four treatments were significantly (P<0.05) more effective than the control treatment (a buffer wash). Citrobio at 20,000 ppm was as effective as the other three products and chlorine against Salmonella but not against E. coli O157:H7. Environne was not more effective (producing reductions of 2.2 to 2.9 log CFU/g) than the control treatment (which produced reductions of 2.1 to 2.3 log CFU/g) against either pathogen. None of the treatments reduced seed germination. In vitro assays, as well as transmission electron microscopy, confirmed the antibacterial nature of the products that were effective against the two pathogens and indicated that they were bactericidal.

The water from the WSPs is chlorinated for safety prior to reuse on nearby farmland. Cyanobacteria concentrations of approximately 1.2 x 106 cells mL(-1) increased the chlorine demand dramatically. Operators continuously increased the disinfectant dose up to 50 mg L(-1) to achieve operational guideline values for combined chlorine (0.5-1.0 mg L(-1)) prior to reuse.

Combined chlorine, disinfection by-product formation, cyanobacteria cell concentration, Escherichia coli inactivation, as well as dissolved organic carbon and free ammonia were monitored. This study shows that, in the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms, CCR does not directly suggest pathogen removal efficiency and is therefore not an ideal parameter to evaluate the effectiveness of disinfection process in WWTP.

There are distinct differences in strategies for control of pathogens in fish used for research compared to fishes reared as pets or in aquaculture. Also, much can be learned from strategies and protocols for control of diseases in rodents used in research, but there are differences. This is due, in part, the unique aquatic environment that is modified by the source and quality of the water provided and the design of facilities.

Here, the authors report a novel sol. bis-chelated gold(I)-diphosphine compd. (GC20) with strong anticancer activity and low toxicity. GC20 shows strong antiproliferation potency against a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines including cisplatin-resistant cancer cells (IC50 ? 0.5 ?M) and significantly reduces tumor growth in several tumor xenografts in mouse models at doses as low as 2 mg/kg. Studies of its mechanism revealed that GC20 specifically inhibits the enzymic activity of thioredoxin reductase by binding to selenocysteine residue, without targeting other well-known selenol and thiol groups contained in biomols. Remarkably, in animal studies GC20 was shown to be well tolerated even at the high dose of 8 mg/kg. The authors' results strongly suggest that GC20 represents a promising candidate for the development of novel anticancer drugs. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

Pure cultures of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and V. cholerae, and a mixed culture of Enterococcus faecium and E. faecilis were grown in saline solution to simulate ballast water and were treated with dosages of ferrate ranging from 0.25 to 5.0 mg/L. A ferrate dose of 5 mg/L resulted in complete disinfection of all organisms tested, and smaller dosages were also very effective. Tailing was consistently observed, and the Hom's model (1972) appeared to most accurately represent the action of ferrate on these organisms. Salinity and pH did not adversely affect results, and regrowth was not a problem. Ferrate shows good potential as an effective disinfectant in the treatment of ballast water. Water Environ.

As model water the effluent of biological denitrification unit for nitrate removal from groundwater, which is characterized by high organic matter and bacteria release, was used. The injury of photocatalysis on coliform bacteria was characterized by means of selective (mEndo) and less selective (mT7) culture media. Different catalyst loadings as well as photolysis and adsorption effects were investigated. Photocatalysis was effective in coliform bacteria inactivation (91-99% after 60 min irradiation time, depending on both catalyst loading and initial density of coliform bacteria detected by mEndo), although no total removal was observed after 60 min irradiation time. The contribution of adsorption mechanism was significant (60-98% after 60 min, depending on catalyst loading) compared to previous investigations probably due to the nature of source water rich in particulate organic matter and biofilm. Photocatalysis process did not result in any irreversible injury (98.8% being the higher injury) under investigated conditions, thus a bacteria regrowth may take place under optimum environment conditions if any final disinfection process (e.g., chlorine or chlorine dioxide) is not used.

Implications for anaesthesia and intensive care\u2020", "abstract": "In the wake of recent atrocities there has been renewed apprehension regarding the possibility of chemical and biological weapon (CBW) deployment by terrorists. Despite various international agreements that proscribe their use, certain states continue to develop chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction. Of greater concern, recent historical examples support the prospect that state-independent organizations have the capability to produce such weapons. Indeed, the deliberate deployment of anthrax has claimed several lives in the USA since September 11, 2001. In the event of a significant CBW attack, medical services would be stretched. However, victim survival may be improved by the prompt, coordinated response of military and civil authorities, in conjunction with appropriate medical care. In comparison with most other specialties, anaesthetists have the professional academic background in physiology and pharmacology to be able to understand the nature of the injuries caused by CBWs. Anaesthetists, therefore, play a vital role both in the initial resuscitation of casualties and in their continued treatment in an intensive care setting. This article assesses the current risk of CBW deployment by terrorists, considers factors which would affect the severity of an attack, and discusses the pathophysiology of those CBWs most likely to be used.

{"id": "3672", "title": "Effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy on blood pressure and peripheral edema", "abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used drugs with potential effects on systemic blood pressure. NSAIDs act by inhibiting synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid via cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2, the 2 isoforms of COX. NSAIDs may affect blood pressure via the renin-angiotensin pathway, alterations in sodium and water retention in the kidneys, inhibition of vasodilating PGs, and production of various vasoconstricting factors, including endothelin-1 and P450-mediated metabolites of arachidonic acid. In 2 meta-analyses, it was found that NSAIDs have small but significant effects on blood pressure, most notably in hypertensive patients on antihypertensive medication. NSAIDs cause small (&lt;5 mm Hg) elevations in systolic blood pressure, and little or no change in diastolic blood pressure. The incidence rates of hypertension and peripheral edema were low, ranging from &lt;1% to &gt;9% of patients. The incidence and levels of hypertension associated with COX-2 inhibitors are within the range of those observed with nonspecific NSAIDs. Apparent differences between the COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib may be functions of differences in study population susceptibilities to NSAID-mediated hypertensive effects. Patients at risk for hypertension should be monitored for changes in blood pressure during NSAID treatment.", "label": 0}

The basis of the method is the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with the fluorogenic substrate monochlorobimane (MCB). This screening method makes it possible to isolate and characterize one recombinant clone that is active with MCB among thousands of inactive variants. Colonies containing GSTs that catalyze the conjugation of GSH with MCB display fluorescence under long-wavelength UV light. The fluorescence is visible instantly. One rat and 11 human GSTs representing four distinct enzyme classes were studied, and all except human GST T1-1 gave rise to fluorescent colonies. The colony assay based on MCB can consequently be broadly applied for identifying active GSTs both after subcloning of wild-type enzymes and in the screening of mutant libraries. Populations of bacteria expressing GSTs can also be analyzed by flow cytometry. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.", "label": 0}

The membrane filter technique was used to detect total coliforms and thermotolerant coliforms on endo agar and MFc agar, respectively. The residual chlorine levels in water from the reservoir, from standpipes along the distribution line, and from households were determined with a commercial test kit. Of a total of 104 drinking water samples obtained from households, 84 (80.8%), 56 (53.8%), and 70 (67.3%) tested positive for total coliforms, thermotolerant coliforms, and Escherichia coli, respectively. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05, chi2). Of the 81 water samples collected from the Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) main supply to households, 38 (46.9%), 13 (16.0%), and 27 (33.3%) were contaminated by total coliforms, thermotolerant coliforms, and E. coli, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05, chi2). Eight (20.5%) of 39 water samples from standpipes along the distribution line tested positive for total coliforms, compared with 4 (10.3%) samples testing positive for thermotolerant coliforms. All five samples of treated water obtained from the reservoir tested negative for coliforms. There was a significant difference (P = 0.004) in the mean residual chlorine levels in water from the reservoir, water from standpipes, and water from households.

The mutation conferred catabolite repression resistance as M7 supported xylanase production on glucose-based medium that was 8.8-fold higher than that of wild type. Product formation parameters were highest in media containing a combination of corncob and corn steep liquor. Among the soluble substrates, xylose was the best inducer. In the presence of glucose, the wild type produced 26 IU of xylanase per g of glucose while the xylanase yield of the mutant was 224 IU per g of glucose. Thermodynamic studies showed that M7 required lower Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy for product formation than the wild type. In biobleaching studies an 18.6% decrease in kappa number and 2.63% increase in brightness for enzyme-treated pulp was observed. Moreover prebleaching with M7-derived enzyme resulted in a 27.3% reduction in chlorine demand as compared with that of 18.5% decrease when wild organism-derived enzyme was employed.

{"id": "7639", "title": "Data collection to support a simplified bacterial regrowth model for distribution systems", "abstract": "The main objectives of this research were to: (1) collect field measurements of bacterial regrowth over a 12-mo study (Sept., 1998-August, 1999) in the Durham and Raleigh (North Carolina) distribution systems to add to the data base from our previous 17-mo study of the same systems and (2) initiate development of a deterministic model of bacterial regrowth that will eventually be linked with components that account for uncertainty in parameter ests. to yield a more realistic model. Heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs) by the R2A agar method, total coliforms, biodegradable dissolved org. carbon (BDOC), chlorine residual (in Durham), combined chlorine (in Raleigh), disinfectant demand, disinfectant decay rates, total org. carbon (TOC), and temp. were measured monthly in the finished water and 10 stations in each distribution system. A tracer study was conducted in Durham to measure mean water residence time. The study design was unique because it included a neg. step input of fluoride at one water treatment plant (WTP) in Durham (Williams WTP) and a simultaneous switch in coagulant at the other (Brown WTP). This permitted calcn. of the percent contribution of water from each WTP at each sampling station and a weighted av. of the mean residence time of water originating from each WTP. Mean water residence time was defined from interpretation of the concn.-time data of chem. tracers at each sampling station. We believe that mean residence time can be correlated with water age as calcd. in hydraulic network models. Based on the HPC data in the Durham and Raleigh distribution systems, the effectiveness of chlorine and combined chlorine in controlling regrowth was judged about equal and confirmed our previous findings. High HPCs were found at stations with low chlorine concns. in Durham and low combined chlorine concns. in Raleigh. Low residual concns. were generally assocd. with long mean residence time, as expected. Although the BDOC was less than 0.5 mg/L, it was sufficient to produce regrowth at stations with low disinfectant residual. The bulk decay rates for free and combined chlorine showed that a simple, first-order rate model is simplistic; concn. of oxidizable org. matter should be included. A mechanistic model of regrowth was developed for a long section of pipe of a fixed diam. under steady-state flow conditions. The model included bacterial growth and attachment to the pipe wall, subsequent bacterial detachment, and chlorine inactivation of bacteria in bulk soln. The model showed that regrowth is very sensitive to the free-chlorine dosage in the finished water. Decreasing the chlorine dosage from 0.7 to 0.5 mg/L increased the HPCs by several orders of magnitude. Once a biofilm was established on the pipe, neither increasing the chlorine dosage nor decreasing the BDOC in the finished water reduced regrowth substantially over 100 h of simulation. The tracer data collected in both Durham and Raleigh will provide an excellent basis for calibration of existing network models such as EPANET. About 27 sets of monthly water quality data are available for testing the accuracy of model predictions for chlorine or chloramine residuals in such models. The development of new models that include bacterial regrowth may be advanced as well by use of our HPC data. The data sets would provide for testing of uncertainty in parameter ests. because, in such models, a distribution of parameter values must be included, and this requires calibration with many sets of data.

Wounded tomatoes placed in a flume with free chlorine at 30 mg/L and then exposed to spores for 1 min developed about 50% less decay incidence during storage at 24\u00b0C for 6 days than did fruit exposed to spores and water alone. In the absence of chlorine, incidence averaged 57% (range, 15 to 95%) for R. stolonifer and 38% (range, 17 to 58%) for G. candidum. Sporadic sour rot lesions were obsd. among fruit that had been treated with free chlorine at 75 mg/L, whereas chlorine at up to 180 mg/L failed to completely protect fruit from Rhizopus rot. A water-sol. dye rapidly penetrated wounds on tomato fruit. The dye framed the outlines of cells at the wound surface and appeared to penetrate into a few intercellular spaces. Application of 1% sodium hypochlorite decolorized the dye on the wound surface, whereas deposits located below the wound surface remained blue. Thus, spores suspended in moving water can escape the action of chlorine if carried into intercellular spaces by diffusion or by capillary movement of cell sap and water.

Lytic bacteriophage cocktails and a levulinic acid produce wash were investigated for their effectiveness against the foodborne pathogens Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella spp., and Salmonella on broccoli, cantaloupe, and strawberries. Inoculated samples were treated with bacteriophage cocktails (BC) before storage at 10 degrees C for 24 h, a levulinic acid produce wash (PW) after storage at 10 degrees C for 24 h, or a combination of the washes (BCPW) before and after storage. All three treatments were compared against a 200-ppm free available chlorine wash. Wash solutions were prepared using potable water and water with an increased organic content of 2.5 g/liter total dissolved solids and total organic carbon. BCPW was the most effective treatment, producing the highest log reductions in the pathogens. Produce treated with BCPW in potable water with a PW exposure time of 5 min resulted in the highest reduction of each pathogen for all samples tested. The type of produce and wash solution had significant effects on the efficacy of the individual treatments. The chlorine wash in water with higher organic content was the least effective treatment tested. An additive effect of BCPW was seen in water with higher organic content, resulting in greater than 4.0-log reductions in pathogens. Our findings indicate that the combination of antimicrobial BC with a commercial produce wash is a very effective method for treating produce contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, Shigella spp., and Salmonella even in the presence of high loads of organic matter.", "label": 1}

These envelopes contribute to the gelatinization endotherm of starch through the controlled dispersion of internal starch polymer. Ghost remnants are shown to be derived from the external layers of the granules for a range of starches with different amylose/amylopectin ratios. The ghost remnants are composed primarily of amylopectin and exhibit elastic/plastic properties. The surface amylopectin is shown to be structurally distinct from internal amylopectin. During the early stages of granule gelatinization, high amylopectin starch granules swell by 200% in size, where the outer layer of the granule forms an envelope surrounding the disrupted internal starch polymers. High amylose starches do not swell, but do form envelopes at high temperatures (? 90 \u00b0C). At a critical stress point the swollen envelope ruptures becoming a ghost, releasing the majority of the internal starch molecules, while a minority of the starch polymers remain trapped by the collapsed ghost. During the final stages of gelatinization the ruptured envelope degrades into ghost remnants. Manipulation of the starch granule surface, either genetically or chemically, would result in alteration of the gelatinization endotherm.", "label": 0}

To improve salinity tolerance, transgenic Carrizo citrange rootstocks that overexpress glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II genes were obtained and their salt stress tolerance was evaluated. Molecular analysis showed high expression for both glyoxalase genes (BjGlyI and PgGlyII) in 5H03 and 5H04 lines. Under control conditions, transgenic and wild type plants presented normal morphology. In salinity treatments, the transgenic plants showed less yellowing, marginal burn in lower leaves and showed less than 40% of leaf damage compared with wild type plants. The transgenic plants showed a significant increase in the dry weight of shoot but there are no differences in the root and complete plant dry weight. In addition, a higher accumulation of chlorine is observed in the roots in transgenic line 5H03 but in shoot it was lower. Also, the wild type plant accumulated around 20% more chlorine in the shoot compared to roots. These results suggest that heterologous expression of glyoxalase system genes could enhance salt stress tolerance in Carrizo citrange rootstock and could be a good biotechnological approach to improve the abiotic stress tolerance in woody plant species.", "label": 0}

Thus there is considerable interest in identifying new sensitizers that localize more effectively in tumors, absorb more strongly at longer wavelengths and can be prepared in high purity. Much of this interest has been directed towards chlorins (reduced porphyrins), which typically absorb strongly in the red.

Decontamination of grapefruit leaves infected with Xcc in relation to disinfectant (none or Pro-San), temperature (0, 10, 40, 45, and 50\u00a0\u00b0C), treatment duration (0, 2, 5, 10, and 20\u00a0min), and assessment time (0, 2, 7, and 14 days post treatment [dpt]) was examined using a split\u2013split\u2013split plot design. Reductions in Xcc recovery generally increased with increasing treatment duration and temperature, and they were greater for treatments involving Pro-San. To examine the general trend of increased Xcc recovery with increasing dpt, nonlinear mixed regression analysis was used to fit a monomolecular model to relative Xcc recovery data.

{"id": "4633", "title": "Opportunities for mitigating pathogen contamination during on-farm food production", "abstract": "Fruits, vegetables, and meat are susceptible to contamination by foodborne pathogens at many points from production through preparation in the home. This review will largely highlight approaches and progress made in the last five years to address strategies to reduce pathogen contamination in animal production but will also touch on the emerging field of preharvest produce food safety. Mitigation strategies can be divided into those that address pathogen reduction in the environment and those that target reduction/elimination of pathogen contamination in animals or plants. The former strategy has been encompassed in studies evaluating sanitation treatments of facilities as well as in numerous epidemiologic risk assessment studies (both on-farm assessments and computer simulation models) that identify management practices that impact pathogen prevalence in animals. Interventions to significantly reduce pathogen exposure via feed or water are dependent on their role as a significant contributor to pathogen contamination in the animal production system. In addition, inconsistent results obtained with interventions of dietary additives or formulation modifications (grain versus forage; inclusion of distiller's grains) on pathogen prevalence in animals have been attributed to a range of factors including target organism, grain type, level of inclusion, the animal's health or stress level, and ability to survive the gastric acidic conditions. Recent attempts to microencapsulate organic acids or bacteriophage within feed have met with only marginal improvements in reducing pathogen carriage in animals but this approach may have greater potential with other antimicrobial additives (i.e., essential oils). Bacteriophage therapy, in general, can significantly reduce pathogen carriage in animals but based on its transient nature and the potential for development of phage-resistant subpopulations, this approach should be administered to animals just prior to slaughter and preferably to animals that are suspected \u201csuper-shedders\u201d. Other promising on-farm intervention approaches have included breeding for pathogen resistance, vaccines, and dietary bacteriocins. To optimize interventions on a cost basis, studies have also determined that application of dietary interventions at specific time points in the animal's production cycle is a useful strategy to reduce pathogen carriage (e.g., probiotics to fertilized eggs and acidified feed to fattening swine). In conclusion, applicable management and intervention strategies may vary depending on the type of food under production; however, it is important to consider from a holistic view how any new intervention strategies will affect the overall production system in order to maintain a successful, efficient food production environment.", "label": 0}

With the anticipation of more stringent total suspended solids and total residual chlorine discharge regulations being imposed on water treatment plant process wastewater discharges (filter backwash and filter-to-waste wastewater, and sludge discharge from the sedimentation basins), dechloramination facilities are being considered as part of the residual solids treatment facilities in the Evansville Water Filtration Plant (WFP) for treatment of the plant process wastewater before discharge to the Ohio River. A comprehensive summary of dechloramination technologies is currently not available, and therefore a literature review was undertaken with the objectives of recommending the most feasible and cost-effective dechloramination alternative and presenting a conceptual design of dechloramination process for treatment of the filter backwash and filter-to-waste wastewater. The dechloramination alternatives examd. in this study include: (1) dechloramination with passive non-chem. methods; (2) dechloramination using regular dechlorination chems.; (3) dechloramination with activated carbon filters; (4) dechloramination with UV light; (5) dechloramination with breakpoint chlorination and dechlorination; and (6) dechloramination using proprietary dechloraminators.

Presence of Legionella in the hospital drinking water is the only risk factor known with certainty to be predictive of risk for contracting Legionnaires' disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Given the high frequency of infection by nonpneumophila and nonserogroup 1 species, both Legionella respiratory culture on selective media and urine antigen testing should be available in the hospital clinical microbiology laboratory. If the drinking water is contaminated by nonpneumophila or nonserogroup 1 species, Legionella culture on selective media must be available for patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia. The impact of PCR application for environmental water specimen remains to be elucidated. Its advantage is that it is a rapid test and its weakness is its low specificity. Copper-silver ionization disinfection and point-of-use (POU) filters have proved effective. Chlorine dioxide and monochloramine are under evaluation and their ultimate role remains to be elucidated. Routine Legionella cultures in concert with disinfectant levels are the best indicators for ensuring long-term efficacy. Percentage distal site positivity for Legionella in drinking water is accurate in predicting risk. Quantitative criteria (CFU/ml) have proven inaccurate and should be abandoned.

Although regeneration of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) was once thought to be impossible, studies over the past two decades have shown that axonal growth after spinal cord injury can occur when provided with the correct substratum. Traditionally, tissue transplantation or peripheral nerve grafting are used to repair damaged or diseased regions of the CNS, but donor shortage and immunological problems associated with infectious disease are often encountered. Fortunately, recent advances in neuroscience, cell culture, and biomaterials provide optimistic future using new treatments for nerve injuries. Biomaterial scaffold creates substrate within which cells are instructed to form a tissue or an organ in a highly controlled way.

Fillets were washed with an ECAS4 solution containing either 45 ppm or 150 ppm of free chlorine and bacterial species enumerated on selective and non-selective media, followed by identification of pure isolates by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The dominant spoilage microbiota in KGW and TAS fillets stored at 4 +/- 1 degrees C were Pseudomonas spp. and Shewanella spp. At either concentration, ECAS4 significantly reduced total bacterial load and specific spoilage organisms on KGW and TAS fillets (approx. 1-2 log colony-forming units) during storage and significantly extended the shelf life of the fillets by 2 and 4 days, respectively. The significant increase in shelf life and quality of fillets was corroborated by raw and cooked sensory evaluation. ECAS4 sanitization could have a significant impact on the overall food industry, translating into health and economic benefits through reduction of food spoilage bacteria and potentially, foodborne pathogens without many of the disadvantages of currently approved biocides.", "label": 1}

In an effort to find a more effective biocide to control biofouling, we investigated the potential of N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) as a biofouling control agent in polyamide membrane. The results of this study show that there are no significant changes in the surface characteristics of polyamide membrane (measured by XPS and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform IR spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR)) when it is exposed to a high concn. of NCS (5000 mg/L as Cl2). Also, there were no significant changes in membrane performance based on permeate flux and salt rejection after exposure to the same concn. of NCS. Most importantly, inactivation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 GFP biofilm cells by 10 mg/L of NCS was 2.2 log after 30 min, which is far greater than that of chlorine. Overall, the results of this study suggest that NCS is a promising novel agent for biofouling control in polyamide membrane processes due to its effective inactivation of biofilm cells on membrane and min. effect on membrane structure and performance.

Some studies have reported enhanced tumor cytotoxicity when sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is combined with photodynamic therapy (PDT). In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic effect of SPDT-activated chlorin e6 (Ce6) on MDA-MB-231 cells. Ce6 was found to localize mainly in mitochondria, with maximal uptake within 4 h. Cell survival was estimated by MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltertrazolium bromide tetrazolium) assay 24 h after irradiation; the combined therapy enhanced cytotoxicity to a greater extent. Apoptosis was analyzed using annexin V-PE/7-ADD (7-aminoactinomycin D) staining as well as DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining, and the results indicated that the cells with apoptotic characteristics were significantly increased in groups given combined therapy. Rhodamine-123 staining and cytochrome c release revealed more serious damage of mitochondria after combined treatment. The generation of reactive oxygen species detected by flow cytometry was greatly increased in\u00a0cells treated with the combination therapy, and the loss in cell viability could be effectively rescued with the reactive oxygen species inhibitor N-acetylcysteine. Moreover, enhancement of cell membrane permeability after ultrasound treatment was evaluated using FD-500, and it was found that the much higher uptake of Ce6 might be involved in PDT therapy with pre-treatment ultrasound. These results suggest that ultrasound enhances the cytotoxicity of Ce6-mediated PDT, possibly because of the increased intracellular Ce6 level and ROS formation by ultrasound pre-treatment.", "label": 0}

The objective of this study was to understand the mechanisms of pathogen colonization of plants relative to lettuce leaf structures so that radiation treatment of fresh leafy vegetables can be optimized. Leaves of iceberg, Boston, green leaf, and red leaf lettuces were cut into pieces, submerged in a cocktail mixture of two isolates of Escherichia coli (Rifampicin resistant), and subjected to a vacuum perfusion process to force the bacterial cells into the intercellular spaces in the leaves. Sixty bags containing 20 g of lettuce each were tested. The inoculated leaves were gamma irradiated (Lanthanum-140, 0.16 kGy/h) at 0.25\u20131.0-kGy (surface dose values), with increments of 0.25 kGy at 15 \u00b0C. Microbial analysis was performed right after irradiation, including non-irradiated leaf pieces (controls). A dose uniformity ratio (max/min dose) of 2.8 was set to confirm the effect of non-uniform dose distribution. Calculated D10-values varied between 48 and 62% based on the dose distribution from the entrance dose. However, despite the subtle differences in composition and structure among the four lettuce varieties, the D10-values were not significantly different. Irradiation up to 1.0-kGy resulted in 3\u20134-log reduction of internalized E. coli on the lettuce leaves. The SEM images suggest that the contamination sites of pathogens in leafy vegetables are mainly localized on crevices and into the stomata. This study shows that irradiation effectively reduces viable E. coli cells internalized in lettuce, and decontamination is not influenced by lettuce variety. Ionizing irradiation effectively reduced the population of internalized pathogen in a dose-dependent manner and could be used as an effective killing step to mitigate the risk of foodborne disease outbreaks.", "label": 0}
{"id": "3350", "title": "Non-thermal plasma-activated water inactivation of food-borne pathogen on fresh produce", "abstract": "Non-thermal plasma has been widely considered to be an effective method for decontamination of foods. Recently, numerous studies report that plasma-activated water (PAW) also has outstanding antibacterial ability. This study presents the first report on the potential of PAW for the inactivation of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) inoculated on strawberries. PAW treatments achieved a reduction of S. aureus ranging from 1.6 to 2.3 log at day-0 storage, while 1.7 to 3.4 log at day-4 storage. The inactivation efficiency depended on the plasma-activated time for PAW generation and PAW-treated time of strawberries inoculated with S. aureus. LIVE/DEAD staining and scanning electron microscopy results confirm that PAW could damage the bacterial cell wall. Moreover, optical emission spectra and oxidation reduction potential results demonstrate the inactivation is mainly attributed to oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species in PAW. In addition, no significant change was found in color, firmness and pH of the PAW treated strawberries. Thus, PAW can be a promising alternative to traditional sanitizers applied in the fresh produce industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "label": 0}

In vitro studies with recombinant human enzymes showed LCI699 to be a potent, reversible, competitive inhibitor of aldosterone synthase (Ki ? 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 nmol/L in humans) with relative selectivity over 11?-hydroxylase. Methods: Hormonal effects of orally administered LCI699 were examd. in rat and monkey in vivo models of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and angiotensin-II-stimulated aldosterone release, and were compared with the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone in a randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted in 99 healthy human subjects. The effects of LCI699 and eplerenone on cardiac and renal sequelae of aldosterone excess were investigated in a double-transgenic rat (dTGR) model overexpressing human renin and angiotensinogen. Results: Rat and monkey in vivo models of stimulated aldosterone release predicted human dose- and exposure-response relationships, but overestimated the selectivity of LCI699 in humans. In the dTGR model, LCI699 dose-dependently blocked increases in aldosterone, prevented development of cardiac and renal functional abnormalities independent of blood pressure changes, and prolonged survival. Eplerenone prolonged survival to a similar extent, but was less effective in preventing cardiac and renal damage. In healthy human subjects, LCI699 0.5 mg selectively reduced plasma and 24 h urinary aldosterone by 49 \u00b1 3% and 39 \u00b1 6% resp. (Day 1, mean \u00b1 SEM; P < 0.001 vs placebo), which was assocd. with natriuresis and an increase in plasma renin activity. Doses of LCI699 greater than 1 mg inhibited basal and ACTH-stimulated cortisol. Eplerenone 100 mg increased plasma and 24 h urinary aldosterone while stimulating natriuresis and increasing renin activity. In contrast to eplerenone, LCI699 increased the aldosterone precursor 11-deoxycorticosterone and urinary potassium excretion. Conclusions: These results provide new insights into the cardiac and renal effects of inhibiting aldosterone synthase in exptl. models and translation of the hormonal effects to humans. Selective inhibition of aldosterone synthase appears to be a promising approach to treat diseases assocd. with aldosterone excess. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

Design of experiments (DoE) showed that 10 mg/L zosteric acid sodium salt reduced C. albicans adhesion and the subsequent biofilm formation by at least 70%, on both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces of 96-well plates. Indeed, biofilm imaging revealed the dramatic impact of zosteric acid sodium salt on biofilm thickness and morphology, due to the inability of the cells to form filamentous structures while remaining metabolically active. In the same way, 10 mg/L zosteric acid sodium salt inhibited C. albicans biofilm formation when added after the adhesion phase. Contrary to zosteric acid sodium salt, methyl zosterate did not affect yeast biofilm. In addition, zosteric acid sodium salt enhanced sensitivity to chlorhexidine, chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, and cis-2-decenoic acid, with a reduction of 0.5 to 8 log units. Preliminary in vitro studies using suitable primary cell based models revealed that zosteric acid sodium salt did not compromise the cellular activity, adhesion, proliferation or morphology of either the murine fibroblast line L929 or the human osteosarcoma line MG-63. Thus the use of zosteric acid sodium salt could provide a suitable, innovative, preventive, and integrative approach to preventing yeast biofilm formation.", "label": 1}

The C. parvum adhesion to human Intestinal 407 cells was significantly suppressed by a low dose (1 mu g/ml) of Mekabu facoidan (1 mu g/ml) (approx. 20.5 oocysts,p < 0.0001), but not by de-sulfated fucoidan (approx. 138.2 oocysts), as compared with that (approx. 121.0 oocysts) of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The in vivo experiments presented here revealed that C parvum oocysts in the fucoidan-treated mice was reduced nearly one fifth (approx. 5.4 x 10(4) oocysts,p < 0.02) of the total number of oocysts (approx. 3.0 x 105) in mice treated with PBS, but no significant effect of de-sulfated fucoidan was observed. These results show that (i) fucoidan effectively inhibits the growth of C. parvum in mice; and (ii) the ester sulfate of fucoidan is an active site to prevent the adhesion of C. parvum to the intestinal epithelial cells. Finally, we concluded that fucoidan might inhibit cryptosporidiosis through the direct binding of fucoidan to the C. parvum-derived functional mediators in the intestinal epithelial cells in neonatal mice.

Each oxidant (chlorine, chlorine dioxide, ozone) has the potential to reduce NDMA formation with varying degree of efficiencies depending on the precursors in source waters. In general, ozone and chlorine are effective oxidants for controlling NDMA precursors, likely due to their high reaction rate consts. with amines.

However, research is needed to determine the ability of these sanitizers to prevent the transfer of pathogens from contaminated to uncontaminated tomatoes, particularly under realistic packinghouse conditions. The goal of this research was to assess the minimum levels of sanitizer needed to prevent Salmonella cross-contamination between tomatoes in a model flume system under clean conditions and conditions where organic matter was added. Inoculated tomatoes (ca. 8.3 log CFU per tomato) were treated along with uninoculated tomatoes in a model flume system containing 0, 10, or 25 ppm of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) under organic loading conditions of 0, 500, or 4,000 ppm of chemical oxygen demand (COD). In the absence of HOCl, uninoculated tomatoes were highly contaminated (ca. 5 log CFU per tomato) by 15 s. No contamination was detectable (<2 log CFU per tomato) on uninoculated tomatoes when HOCl was present, except with 10 ppm at 4,000 ppm of COD, suggesting failure of 10 ppm of HOCl as a sanitizer under very high organic loading conditions. In the presence of HOCl or peroxyacetic acid, Salmonella was undetectable (<1 log CFU/ml) in the model flume water samples after 2 and 30 s, respectively. Upon enrichment, none of the uninoculated tomatoes treated with 25 ppm of HOCl for 120 s were positive for Salmonella, even in the presence of organic loading at 500 ppm of COD. Based on these findings, 25 ppm of HOCl may be adequate to prevent cross-contamination when the concentration is properly maintained, COD does not exceed 500 ppm, and tomatoes are treated for at least 120 s. Further validation in a larger commercial setting and using higher organic loading levels is necessary because managing HOCl at this low concentration is difficult, especially in a recirculating system.

Materials and methods The retrospective analysis included 71 children (mean age 2 years) hospitalized in the Gastroenterology Unit between Jan 2008 and Dec 2010. In all children with the Campylobacter infection clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and associated infections were analyzed. Results Campylobacter infection was diagnosed in 71 children (42 boys), which represented 5.28% of the children among 1343 patients hospitalized because of vomiting or diarrhea. In 22 children the Campylobacter infection was accompanied by other gastrointestinal infections (enteropathogenic strains of E. coli, Rotavirus, Salmonella). Mean duration of hospitalization was 7.24 days. According to age, analyzing the clinical symptoms of campylobacteriosis statistically significant incidence of watery diarrhea in children over 1 year of age has been shown, and abdominal pain in children over 3 years of age has been demonstrated. Diarrhea with blood occurred most frequently in children under 1 year of age. Conclusions Due to the observed increasing incidence of Campylobacter infections it seems to be reasonable to take feces inoculation in children with diarrhea to 3 years of age, especially in the presence of bloody feces.", "label": 0}
{"id": "1416", "title": "A new method for efficient detection of Cryptosporidium RNA by real-time reverse transcription-PCR with surfactants", "abstract": "Cryptosporidium is one of the most common causes of waterborne diseases worldwide. Its oocysts possess a robust wall that is extremely resistant to the chlorine used for potable water disinfection. The current procedures of nucleic acid extraction and purification, such as the freeze-thaw (F/T) method and the commercial kits, are time consuming and expensive. To this end, a surfactant extraction treatment (SET) was developed as a method to extract nucleic acids from Cryptosporidium using only surfactants. The use of 18S rRNA improves the sensitivity of Cryptosporidium detection for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), because 18S rRNA molecules are constitutively present in high copy numbers. Therefore, we applied SET to the detection of Cryptosporidium 18S rRNA using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for the first time. RT-PCR was inhibited by 0.01% of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), whereas the inhibition did not occur with 5% of the nonionic surfactants Tween 20, Triton X-100, Tween 80, and Triton X-114. However, the nonionic surfactants could not completely suppress the inhibition induced by 0.1% SDS. We successfully extracted 18S rRNA genes from oocysts by SET without the F/T method and detected them by real-time RT-PCR.", "label": 0}

Like many redox-regulated transcription factors, the Escherichia coli repressor NemR responds to RCS by using the reversible oxidation of highly conserved cysteines to alter its DNA-binding affinity. However, earlier work showed that RCS response in NemR does not depend on any commonly known oxidative cysteine modifications. We have now determined the crystal structure of NemR, showing that the regulatory cysteine, Cys106, is in close proximity to a highly conserved lysine (Lys175). We used crystallographic, biochemical, and mass spectrometric analyses to analyze the role of this lysine residue in RCS sensing. Based on our results, we hypothesize that RCS treatment of NemR results in the formation of a reversible Cys106-Lys175 sulfenamide bond. This is, to our knowledge, the first description of a protein whose function is regulated by a cysteine-lysine sulfenamide thiol switch, constituting a novel addition to the biological repertoire of functional redox switches.", "label": 0}

Different exposure times, as well as concns. of the disinfectants were evaluated. In addn., org. acids such as lactic and acetic were examd. for their ability to inactivate L. monocytogenes present on the surface of vegetables.

This has led to great interest in detecting serum autoantibodies raised against small quantities of oxidatively modified host proteins in patients with autoimmune inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we provide protocols for the preparation and chemical characterization of oxidatively modified protein antigens and procedures for their use in immunoblotting and ELISAs that detect autoantibodies against these antigens in clinical samples. These gel electrophoresis- and plate reader-based immunochemical methods sometimes suffer from low analytical specificity and/or sensitivity when used for serum autoantibody detection. This is often because a single solid-phase protein (antigen) is exposed to a complex mixture of serum proteins that undergo nonspecific binding. Therefore more sensitive/specific techniques are required to detect autoantibodies specifically directed against oxidatively modified proteins. To address this, we describe novel affinity chromatography protocols by which purified autoantibodies are isolated from small volumes (<1 ml) of serum. We have also developed strategies to conjugate submilligram amounts of isolated immunoglobulins and other proteins to fluorophores. This set of methods will help facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic autoantibodies in patients.", "label": 0}

The increasing resistance to vancomycin is the result of a change of an amide linkage (D-Ala-D-Ala) to an eater linkage (D-Ala-D-Lactate) in the bacterial cell-wall precursors. Results: We have used a peptide terminating in the sequence -Lys-D-Ala-D-Lactate linked by its amino terminus to a docosanoyl (C-22) acyl chain and anchored in a supported lipid monolayer to mimic the surface of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Surface plasmon resonance analysis was then used to investigate the binding of glycopeptide group antibiotics to this surface. Vancomycin, which dimerises weakly, bound with low affinity, whereas strongly dimerising antibiotics, such as chloroeremomycin, bound with higher affinities. Antibiotics that have attached hydrophobic groups, such as teicoplanin and biphenylchloroeremomycin (LY307599), bound to the lipid monolayer. This resulted in an enhanced affinity for the lipid-anchored peptide at the surface relative to affinities for an analogous non-anchored peptide in solution. Conclusions: We have shown that the affinities of glycopeptide antibiotics for a model of the surface of a vancomycin-resistant bacterium are enhanced relative to affinities determined in free solution. We have also shown that antibiotics that have membrane anchors bind tightly to the model surface and that this feature is an important determinant of the ability of an antibiotic to kill vancomycin-resistant enterococci.", "label": 0}

Based upon available data, a six log (99.9999 %) reduction in virus level from screened and tested blood components should significantly reduce or eliminate the risk of post-transfusion infection. The objective has been to identify \u00ab genericmethods, that is, one that would be applicable to all virus. For red cells, physical and chemical approaches have been studied ; for platelets, the approaches have been limited to chemical. The physical methods include depletion of leukocytes by filtration, removal of plasma by washing, and viral inactivation by heat. Among the chemicals investigated to inactivate or help displace virus are ozone, detergents, and hypochlorous acid. Several photochemicals have also received intensive investigation : merocyanine 540, a benzoporphyrin derivative, aluminum phthalocyanine, and methylene blue. For platelets, photochemical inactivation methods using merocyanine 540, and two psoralen derivatives, 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and aminomethyl trimethyl psoralen (AMT), have also been studied. Approaches which include washing are not suitable. For the most part, either viral removal or inactivation has been insufficient, or red cell or platelet damage unacceptable. However, there are a few indications that at least inactivation of a specific virus, such as HIV, may be possible without major cell damage. These studies are in their early stages and significant work remains. If feasibility is clearly shown in vitro, it is likely that in vivo primate studies to demonstrate safety and efficacy will be required.", "label": 0}

Methods Fifty-two freshly extracted teeth with pulpal necrosis and associated periradicular radiolucencies were obtained from 34 subjects. Twenty-six teeth with 49 canals received chemomechanical debridement (CMD) with 6% NaOCl, and 26 teeth with 52 canals received CMD plus PDT. For PDT, root canal systems were incubated with methylene blue (MB) at concentration of 50 ?g/mL for 5 minutes, followed by exposure to red light at 665 nm with an energy fluence of 30 J/cm2. The contents of root canals were sampled by flushing the canals at baseline and after CMD alone or CMD+PDT and were serially diluted and cultured on blood agar. Survival fractions were calculated by counting colony-forming units (CFUs). Partial characterization of root canal species at baseline and after CMD alone or CMD+PDT was performed by using DNA probes to a panel of 39 endodontic species in the checkerboard assay. Results The Mantel-Haenszel ?2 test for treatment effects demonstrated the better performance of CMD+PDT over CMD (P = .026). CMD+PDT significantly reduced the frequency of positive canals relative to CMD alone (P = .0003). After CMD+PDT, 45 of 52 canals (86.5%) had no CFUs as compared with 24 of 49 canals (49%) treated with CMD (canal flush samples). The CFU reductions were similar when teeth or canals were treated as independent entities. Post-treatment detection levels for all species were markedly lower for canals treated by CMD+PDT than they were for those treated by CMD alone. Bacterial species within dentinal tubules were detected in 17 of 22 (77.3%) and 15 of 29 (51.7%) canals in the CMD and CMD+PDT groups, respectively (P = .034). Conclusions Data indicate that PDT significantly reduces residual bacteria within the root canal system, and that PDT, if further enhanced by technical improvements, holds substantial promise as an adjunct to CMD.", "label": 0}

The use of monochloramine (MCA) as the primary biocide is as effective as the use of free-chlorine in cooling systems using secondary-treated municipal wastewater (MWW) as the sole makeup water source. However, severe scaling caused by the secondary effluent necessitates incorporation of an additional treatment of secondary effluent (i.e.,tertiary treatment) prior to use as makeup water for recirculating cooling systems. In the research reported in this paper, the effectiveness of MCA as a cooling-system biocide was evaluated for three types of tertiary-treated MWW, as follows: (1)acidification, (2)nitrification and sand filtration, and (3)nitrification, sand filtration, and granular activated-carbon adsorption. The impact of these tertiary treatment processes on chloramination was studied in both laboratory and pilot-scale experiments. For the third type of MWW treatment, reducing the total organic carbon (TOC) content in MWW exerted a 37% decrease in biological growth potential but less than a 5% decrease in biological growth rate. A MCA residual of 2-3mg/L was required to achieve biological-growth control objectives with respect to planktonic and sessile heterotrophic bacteria in cooling systems regardless of the tertiary treatment employed. Legionella analyses indicated that chloramination was effective in controlling proliferation of these species for all tertiary-treated wastewaters. Overall, preformed MCA was effective as a primary biocide in all tertiary-treated MWW evaluated in the research reported in this paper. Nitrification followed by sand filtration was the optimal tertiary treatment among the three investigated MWW because the biological-control objectives could be achieved with lower doses. The use of granular activated-carbon adsorption revealed no additional benefit compared to nitrification and sand filtration.", "label": 0}

At a UV dose of 51 mJ/cm(2), the sequential exposure to UV or the simultaneous exposure in the primary disinfection stage enhanced MS2 inactivation rates during the secondary disinfection stage by chlorine by 1.5-2.7 times, compared to the rates solely by free chlorine.

FA and BaP activated by S9 from Aroclor 1254 (PCB)-treated rats induce HPRT mutations in CHO cells with about equal effectiveness at the same exposure doses, which also lead to the same frequencies of repairable DNA adducts, enzyme-induced strand breaks being used as an indirect measure of adducts to DNA. FA was also shown to be an efficient inducer of SCE in human peripheral lymphocytes cocultivated with PCB-treated HepG2 cells or with liver cells from PCB-pretreated rats. For the induction of SCE, FA and BaP were shown to act additively. From metabolic studies with liver microsomes from C57Bl/6 mice it is concluded that, whereas BaP induces the metabolism of BaP to the mutagenic epoxide, neither BaP nor FA is able to induce the metabolism of FA. In mutation experiments with V79 cells (XEM2) constitutive for P450 IA1 activity, BaP 7,8-diol but not FA 2,3-diol provokes a high frequency of HPRT mutations.

Cefotaxime, cefalexin, ampicillin and tetracycline were completely removed under all three initial free chlorine dosages (5 mg/L, 10 mg/L, and 15 mg/L). The removal efficiencies of sulphamethoxazole, sulphadiazine, roxithromycin, anhydro-erythromycin, ofloxacin, and trimethoprim were closely correlated to the residual free chlorine concentration, and no further significant mass removal was observed after the residual free chlorine concentration decreased to less than 0.75 mg/L. Ammonia plays a critical role during chlorination because of its competition with antibiotics for free chlorine to form combined chlorine, which reacts slowly with these antibiotics. Except for norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, the removal behaviours of the 10 other target antibiotics under ammonia nitrogen concentrations ranging from 2 to 15 mg/L were characterised by a rapid initial removal rate upon contact with free chlorine during the first 5 s-1 min (depending on the specific antibiotic and ammonia nitrogen concentration) and then a much slower removal rate. Free chlorine was responsible for the reaction with antibiotics during the rapid stage (first 5 s-1 min), whereas combined chlorine reacted with antibiotics in the subsequent slow stage. Combined chlorine can remove norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin at a relatively faster rate. The presence of suspended solids at 30 mg/L slightly decreased the antibiotic removal rate. The kinetic rate constants decreased by 2.1-13.9%, while the half-lives increased by 2.0-15.0% compared to those of a 0 mg/L suspended solid for the target antibiotics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Orthogonal experiment was performed to determine the recipe of the disinfectant powder. Stability test, suspension quantitative bactericidal test, simulation field trial, and animal toxicity test were carried out to observe its bactericidal and toxicological effects. RESULTS: The orthogonal experiment showed that the type of water solution had no effect on the disinfectant powder and the best ratio of sodium chlorite to solid acid was 1:3. Ten grams of the disinfectant powder was fully dissolved in 20 mL water for 2 min, and diluted to 500 mL in water. After 5-10 min, the concentration of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) solution was 266 mg/L to 276 mg/L. After stored at 54 degrees C for 14 d, the average concentration of ClO2 was decreased by 5.03%. Suspension quantitative bactericidal test showed that the average killing logarithm (KL) value for both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in 100 mg/L ClO2 solution for 2 min was over 5.00. in simulation field trial, the average descending KL value for Escherichia coli in the solution containing 100 mg/L ClO2 for 5 min was over 3.00.

However, the adaptation and the resistance of the sludge microbial ecosystem to stress conditions is a major question as it may definitively limit the effect of some treatments. Defence mechanisms developed by aerobic organisms, in particular, in response to oxidative stress involve various antioxidant activities and compounds such as glutathione. An HPLC method was developed for measuring reduced and total glutathione (GSH and GSHt) in perchloric acid sludge extracts. The method was sensitive, highly specific and validated for linearity, precision and recovery. Considering the extraction yield and the oxidation of GSH during extract storage, the measured GSH concentration was estimated to represent 60% of the GSH content from activated sludges. GSHt ranged from 0.32 to 3.34 mumol g(-1) volatile solids and the GSH/GSHt ratio ranged from 32% to 91%. Measurements performed on sludges stressed in precise conditions selected to reach a reduction of sludge production showed a decrease of GSH and GSHt concentrations with thermal, mechanical, electric and ozone stress.

The same reduction of C. jejuni was obtained with 0.02-0.04 mg/l of free chlorine in 12 min at 4 degrees C and 2 min at 10 degrees C. These results indicate that C, jejuni is more sensitive to chlorine than most other waterborne pathogens and E, coli, indicating that it may easily be controlled by present disinfection practices. Y. enterocolitica is about as sensitive to chlorine as E. coli, but may survive for a longer time in cold, clean surface waters. E. coli is an adequate indicator for C. jejuni both in water sources and in chlorinated drinking water. E. coli, however, is not a safe indicator for the presence of Y. enterocolitica O:3 under all conditions, and especially not in oligotrophic lake water. Furthermore, the results for Y. enterocolitica O:3 indicate an association between enhanced resistance to chlorine and the presence of a virulence plasmid.

Current methods of detecting these organisms in water are insensitive, labor-intensive, highly subjective, and severely limited by sample turbidity. We describe here an alternative technique utilizing electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology for detecting C. parvum oocysts in environmental water samples. This method is quantitative, reproducible, and requires only minimal sample processing. Currently, the ECL assay can detect as few as one oocyst in one milliliter of concentrated test sample with sample turbidity of up to 10,000 nephelometric turbidity units. Water and sewer samples collected during a cryptosporidiosis outbreak were tested by ECL assay. Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts were found in the source water at the time of outbreak, and a sharply decreasing level of oocysts in sewer samples was observed over a three-month period following the outbreak.", "label": 0}

To indicate microbiol. quality of drinking water produced by the Alice water treatment plant (AWTP), heterotrophic plate count bacteria (HPC), Salmonella species (SP), fecal coliform (FC), and total coliform (TC) bacteria were detd. using std. methods. Also measured were physicochem. properties (pH, temp., turbidity, residual Cl2, F-, PO43-, Cr, SO42-, NO3-, NO2-, Cu, Cd, Zn, total hardness, COD). Drinking water chem. quality was acceptable except for turbidity, which was 1.6-4.7 NTU according to location in the distribution system. High turbidity resulted in the absence of or low residual Cl2 (<0.3 mg/L) in water. Failure of the AWTP to protect the distribution system with sufficient residual Cl2 resulted in microbiol. quality (HPC, 2.2 \u00d7 103 to 9.6 \u00d7 104 colony-forming units [cfu]/mL; SP, 0-29 cfu/100 mL; FC, 6-39 cfu/100 mL; TC, 7-209 cfu/100 mL) which exceeded potable water stds. Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Serratia odorifera, Salmonella arizonae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Serratia liquefaciens, and Serratia marcescens were present in all water samples; there was also the possibility of Vibrio species in Victoria East Clinic water. Thus, drinking water supplied by AWTP poses a health threat to consumers and calls for urgent intervention by local authorities. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}

The GAC process further reduces total org. C (TOC) to <1.0 mg/L before the water enters the final disinfection and pH adjustment treatment steps. By allowing GAC contactors to reduce TOC available for reaction with Cl2, the principal disinfectant, the city can meet proposed Stage 1 and Stage 2 requirements of the Disinfectant/Disinfection Byproduct Rule (D/DBP) for both trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids. The GAC must be periodically reactivated for continued adsorption of TOC using on-site multiple hearth furnaces. A balancing act exists between water quality and furnace operations to be cost effective without compromising water quality. Optimization of this process is discussed. A modified furnace reactivation schedule helped optimize GAC use. Overall, reactivation costs decreased by 8% in 1997 while continuing to maintain distribution system trihalomethane formation to below proposed Stage 2 D/DBP Rule concns. The reactivation schedule modification had a large impact on TOC removal across the GAC process.

Dishwater contains organic matter and bacteria and bacterial activities are partly reduced by high pH (11-12) and temperature (55-65 degrees C) in professional and domestic dishwashers. In manual dishwashing, temperature and pH are kept lower (45 degrees C and pH 7), which is less sufficient for the reduction of bacteria. In a broth, organic loaded in order to mimic dishwater, solutions of Ag or hypochlorite were added at 45 degrees C and pH 7 and samples were withdrawn for a period of 40 minutes. 1 ppm Ag+ was required to obtain a 1 to 2 log unit reduction of B. cereus and S. aureus in 10 minutes. An addition of 160 ppm hypochlorite reduced B. cereus and S. aureus by 4 log units in two minutes, whereas 16 ppm of hypochlorite had no effect on the survival of S. aureus. The level of free residual chlorine varied with the COD value of the cultured solutions. We found that both silver and hypochlorite can be used as antibacterial agents in dishwater. The disadvantage with the use of hypochlorite is that the COD value determines the antibacterial effect. Using Ag+ solutions to reduce bacteria has the drawback that they are toxic to water-living organisms and are considered to develop Ag+ resistant bacteria. To reduce the risk of cross-contamination from dishwater to dishware high temperature and detergent with high pH is to be preferred.", "label": 1}

To uncover the genetic basis and pathophysiological processes that could provide additional homeostatic capacities during lung injury, 40 inbred murine strains were exposed to chlorine, and haplotype association mapping was performed. The identified single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations were evaluated through transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling. Using >/= 10% allelic frequency and >/= 10% phenotype explained as threshold criteria, promoter SNPs that could eliminate putative transcriptional factor recognition sites in candidate genes were assessed by determining transcript levels through microarray and reverse real-time PCR during chlorine exposure. The mean survival time varied by approximately 5-fold among strains, and SNP associations were identified for 13 candidate genes on chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 9, and 15. Microarrays revealed several differentially enriched pathways, including protein transport (decreased more in the sensitive C57BLKS/J lung) and protein catabolic process (increased more in the resistant C57BL/10J lung).

Improvement of pulmonary gas exchange in patients and animals with acute lung injury nursed in the prone position was observed in recent years. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of prone and supine positions on pulmonary and cardiovascular functions following experimental chlorine gas lung injury. Methods: Twenty anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs were exposed to chlorine gas (400 p.p.m. in air) for 20 min in the supine position, then assigned randomly to ventilation in the supine or prone positions (n=10 in each group). Hemodynamics, gas exchange, lung mechanics and oxygen transport were evaluated for 5h. Results: All animals showed severe pulmonary dysfunction immediately after chlorine gassing with a threefold increase in pulmonary vascular resistance index, a drop in arterial oxygenation (12.3\u00b11.3 kPa to 5.4\u00b10.7 kPa) and a fall in lung-thorax compliance (22\u00b11 ml cmH2O-1 to 8\u00b12 ml cmH2O-1).

Lung-thorax compliance improved significantly with time in the prone group only (P<0.01). Oxygen delivery increased significantly in prone animals compared with animals nursed in the supine posture (P<0.001).

Individual and multiple-sequential interventions were evaluated at three processing plants: (i) plant A (New York wash, postevisceration wash, inside-outside bird washes 1 and 2, chlorine dioxide wash, chlorine dioxide wash plus chlorine chiller, chiller exit spray, and postchiller wash), (ii) plant B (New York wash, inside-outside bird washes 1 and 2, trisodium phosphate wash, and chlorine chiller), and (iii) plant C (trisodium phosphate wash and chlorine chiller). The majority of individual interventions effectively or significantly (P < 0.05) reduced microbial populations on or in carcasses, carcass parts, and processing water. Reductions in APC, TCC, and ECC due to individual interventions ranged from 0 to 1.2, 0 to 1.2, and 0 to 0.8 log CFU/ml, respectively.

Percent injury following treatment ranged from 84% to 99%. Injured Listeria were repaired in Listeria repair broth (LRB) at 37 degrees C. Comparison of the repair curves generated by each method indicated that the time for repair was greater for sanitizer-injured cells (14 h) than for heat-injured cells (5 h). Sites of injury were determined by repairing heat- and sanitizer-treated Listeria in LRB supplemented with one of the following inhibitors: rifampicin (10 and 20 mu g/ml), chloramphenicol (5 mu g/ml), cycloserine D (10 and 20 mu g/ml), and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP) (2.5 mu g/ml). In both heat- and sanitizer-injured populations, a total inhibition of repair was seen following incubation with rifampicin, chloramphenicol and CCCP. These results clearly indicate a requirement for mRNA, protein synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation for repair to occur. The cell wall is not a site of damage since cycloserine D had no effect on repair of heat- or sanitizer-injured Listeria. Investigation of damage to the cell membrane showed that stress caused by sublethal heat or sanitizer did not allow proteins or nucleotides to leak into the medium. The recognition of injury and repair in Listeria will lead to improved methods of detection and ultimately to control strategies which prevent outgrowth of this organism in foods.", "label": 0}

The results obtained with this technique were compared to two other enumeration methods, the plate count (PC) and conventional direct viable count (c-DVC). An environmental isolate (Klebsiella pneumoniae Kp1) was used to form biofilms on stainless steel coupons in a stirred batch reactor. The in situ DVC method was applied to directly assess the viability of bacteria in biofilms without disturbing the integrity of the interfacial community. As additional advantages, the results were observed after 4 h instead of the 24 h incubation time required for colony formation and total cell numbers that remained on the substratum were enumerated. Chlorine and monochloramine were used to determine the susceptibilities of attached and planktonic bacteria to disinfection treatment using this novel analytical approach. The planktonic cells in the reactor showed no significant change in susceptibility to disinfectants during the period of biofilm formation. In addition, the attached cells did not reveal any more resistance to disinfection than planktonic cells. The disinfection studies of young biofilms indicated that 0.25 mg/l free chlorine (at pH 7.2) and 1 mg/l monochloramine (at pH 9.0) have comparable disinfection efficiencies at 25 degrees C. Although being a weaker disinfectant, monochloramine was more effective in removing attached bacteria from the substratum than free chlorine. The in situ DVC method always showed at least one log higher viable cell densities than the PC method, suggesting that the in situ DVC method is more efficient in the enumeration of biofilm bacteria. The results also indicated that the in situ DVC method can provide more accurate information regarding the cell numbers and viability of bacteria within biofilms following disinfection.", "label": 0}

In addition, the application of silver ions in combination with other biocides, especially UV254 (UV-C) irradiation, was reported to be effective in enhancing its germicidal activity. However, it is not yet known how UV-A (300-400 nm) or visible light irradiation, which have little or no antimicrobial activities, affect microorganism inactivation by silver ions. This study newly reports that the inactivation efficiencies of Escherichia coli and MS-2 phage by silver ions were significantly enhanced by UV-A or visible light irradiation. UV-A irradiation enhanced the inactivation of E. coli and MS-2 phage by 3.0 and 2.5 log/30 min, respectively, as compared with the simple summated value of individual applications of silver ions and UV-A. A similar trend was observed with visible light irradiation (> 400 nm) although the level of enhancement was lessened. The photochemical reaction of silver-cysteine complex was suggested as a possible mechanism for this enhancement. Spectrophotometric and MALDI-TOF mass analyses support the fact that silver ions coupled with light irradiation causes critical cell damage through the complexation of silver ions with thiol (-SH) groups in structural or enzymatic proteins of the microorganisms and their subsequent photochemical destruction.

The CSF is known to contain a wide range of endogenous neuromodulatory substances, but their collective influence on neuronal activity has been poorly investigated. We show here that replacing artificial CSF (aCSF), routinely used for perfusion of brain slices in vitro, with human CSF (hCSF) powerfully boosts spontaneous firing of CA1, CA3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the rat brain slice. CA1 pyramidal neurons in hCSF display lowered firing thresholds, more depolarized resting membrane potentials and reduced input resistance, mimicking properties of pyramidal neurons recorded in vivo. The increased excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons was completely occluded by intracellular application of GTP?S, suggesting that endogenous neuromodulators in hCSF act on G-protein coupled receptors to enhance excitability. We found no increase in spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission by hCSF, indicating a differential effect on glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. Our findings highlight a previously unknown function of the CSF in promoting spontaneous excitatory activity, and may help to explain differences obsd. in the activity of pyramidal neurons recorded in vivo and in vitro.

One androgenic/anabolic steroid in particular, stanozolol, appears to stabilize the GABA(A) receptor in a moderate-affinity state for benzodiazepine binding. In the present study, we demonstrate the effects of stanozolol on the functional responsiveness of the GABA(A) receptor. After pre-incubation with stanozolol, we observed a decrease in the E(max) and EC50 values for GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx into cortical synaptoneurosornes. Moreover, in the presence of stanozolol, flunitrazepam- enhanced GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx was lost, and the GABA(A) receptor was stabilized in a functional state that was resistant to further desensitization by agonist. Stanozolol does not appear to reduce GABA- stimulated 36Cl- influx by acting as a channel blocker at the well- characterized channel blocker binding site, as illustrated by the GABA- sensitive biphasic effects of stanozolol on [35S]t- butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding.

This was achieved by investigating the modulation of ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated [36Cl-] influx by BZ ligands, as well as pentobarbital after chronic flurazepam treatment, in well characterized mammalian cortical neurons. Chronic flurazepam treatment (5 ?M, 10 days) produced decreased efficacy of BZ agonists (diazepam and flunitrazepam) and inverse agonists (methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-?-carboline-3'-carboxylate and ethyl-?-carboline-3-carboxylate), as measured by GABA-induced [36Cl- ] influx. The chronic flurazepam treatment, although not altering their EC50/IC50 values, decreased the E(max)/-E(max) values. Furthermore, the decreased efficacy was reversed after a 72-hr withdrawal, and by concomitant exposure of the neurons to Ro15-1788 (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6- oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5?][1,4]-BZ-3-carboxylate), a BZ receptor antagonist, but not by R 5135 (3?-hydroxy-16-imino-5?-17-androstan-11-one; a GABA receptor antagonist) and picrotoxin (a channel blocker). The chronic flurazepam treatment also produced uncoupling between pentobarbital and BZ receptor sites, and decreased the efficacy of pentobarbital to enhance GABA-mediated [36Cl-] influx, events also reversed at 72-hr withdrawal and concomitant exposure to Ro15-1788. Chronic flurazepam treatment-induced uncoupling and decreased efficacy of BZ agonists was not reversed by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, R 5135, or channel blocker, picrotoxin. Taken together, these findings suggest that chronic flurazepam treatment produces the decreased efficacy of BZ agonists and inverse agonists and barbiturates with the GABA receptor gated Cl- channel, and these events are mediated selectively via the BZ reception site. However, the set point was not shifted toward the inverse agonistic spectrum of the pharmacological profile. The decreased efficacy may be responsible for the tolerance associated with the chronic BZ treatment. The molecular basis for the decreased efficacy could be due to an alteration in the relative levels of various subunits that form the functional GABA(A) receptors or due to post-translational modification of the receptors.", "label": 0}

Cherry tomatoes were subjected to CPT using helium (He) or a He-oxygen (O2) gas mixture for 2\u201310 min at 400\u2013900 W of plasma generation power. A central composite method was applied to investigate the interactions between treatment conditions and the Salmonella reduction rate, weight loss, or temperature of the tomatoes. CPTs using He and a He-O2 gas mixture at 827 W for 9 min resulted in the greatest reduction in Salmonella numbers (3.5 \u00b1 0.1 and 3.5 \u00b1 0.5 log CFU/tomato, respectively) and temperature increases of 3.0 \u00b1 0.3 and 3.5 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b0C, respectively. He-CPT at 900 W for 10 min, determined as the optimal conditions for Salmonella inactivation in this study, did not appreciably influence the surface morphology of cherry tomatoes. While the optimal He-CPT did not effectively inhibit the growth of Salmonella on the tomatoes at 25 \u00b0C, the treatment prevented the Salmonella growth during storage at 5 \u00b0C, without affecting the tomato respiration rate (P &lt; 0.05). These results demonstrate the potential of CPT as a postharvest technology to improve the microbiological safety of cherry tomatoes against Salmonella, without affecting their biological properties.", "label": 0}

Coagulant/disinfection products (CDPs) have the distinct advantage of providing microbial quality improvement, turbidity reductions and a free chlorine residual (FCR). The laboratory treatment performance of a novel CDP, the 'Pureit((R)) ' sachet, has been evaluated under different water quality conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The CDP performance was evaluated with regard to bacteriological humanitarian water quality objectives as well as the recent World Health Organization recommendations for evaluating POU water treatment options. At least 4 log10 reductions of tested bacterial indicators for a 'highly protective' status were attained in the tested conditions. Treated waters were consistently below 10 MPN per 100 ml with regard to final Escherichia coli concentrations (i.e. 'low risk') with majority of samples with no detectable E. coli (i.e. 'very low risk'). Attainment of the target FCR levels (at least 0.5 and 0.2 mg l(-1) after 0.5 and 24 h respectively) was dependant on the test water matrix. FCRs are thought to have been affected by the product's formulation, which contains a quenching agent intended to reduce chlorinous tastes. Treated water turbidity levels were marginally above the nonhealth-based target of five nephelometric turbidity units, partially due to the filtration cloth employed. CONCLUSIONS: This study has served to identify the performance envelopes of the CDP under challenging conditions. In particular, initial alkaline pHs negatively affected this product's performance with regard to bacterial log10 reductions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This CDP has the potential to attain humanitarian drinking water quality objectives when not operating under extreme conditions; consistently achieving E. coli log10 reductions between 4.5 and 5.2 resulting in treated water with E. coli concentrations mostly below the <1 MPN per 100 ml target level.", "label": 0}

It has become a prototype of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) organisms. Aim To identify risk factors for acquisition of XDR-AB and to develop a colonization risk score in intensive care unit (ICU) patients in a Lebanese tertiary care centre where XDR-AB causes intermittent outbreaks. Methods This retrospective study included 257 patients with baseline negative screening cultures for XDR-AB admitted to a seven-bed ICU from July 2012 to July 2013. Patients' demographic data and clinical characteristics were collected from the hospital's electronic medical records. Univariate analysis of potential risk factors was performed followed by multivariate analysis to determine parameters to be included in the colonization risk score. Findings The rate of XDR-AB acquisition was 15.6%. Multivariate analysis identified urinary catheter placement &gt;6 days (odds ratio: 16.98; 95% confidence interval: 3.96\u201349.56; P &lt; 0.0001), ICU contact pressure for &gt;4 days (2.38; 1.48\u20133.57; P = 0.001), presence of gastrostomy tube (5.44; 1.43\u201320.68; P = 0.013), and previous use of carbapenems or piperacillin\u2013tazobactam (4.20; 1.65\u201311.81; P = 0.002) as parameters to be included in the colonization score. The risk of XDR-AB acquisition was 0, 5.6%, 17.2%, 56.8%, and 80% in the presence of a score of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. A score of 4 indicates high probability of XDR-AB acquisition, suggesting that patient isolation is required; zero indicates a low probability of XDR-AB acquisition. Conclusion Risk factors could be used to develop a score to decide which patients need isolation to limit the spread of XDR-AB.", "label": 0}

Only rinsing with 200 mg/L sodium hypochlorite, peroxyacetic acid or contact with gaseous chlorine dioxide resulted in significantly higher reductions of the total plate count (1.5-2.5 log cfu/g) than the ones achieved by washing with tap water (0.5 log cfu/g). However, those treatments giving the best results from a microbial point of view induced significant changes in the sensory quality. Regarding the effects on nutrient content, the mechanical effects caused by water washing already reduced the vitamin C content by 16-29%. Contrary to washing with neutral electrolysed oxidising water and contact with chlorine dioxide gas, a supplementary decrease of the vitamin C content ranging between 9 and 28% was observed, when peroxyacetic acid or 200 mg/L sodium hypochlorite were used. After the use of peroxyacetic acid or gaseous chlorine dioxide, the phenol content also showed a decreasing trend, although not statistically significant. Apart from the effect of washing with water, the lipophilic nutrients were well retained after a decontamination step except for the alpha-tocopherol content, when peroxyacetic acid was used (-43 to 56%), and for the all-trans-beta-carotene content (-8%) of cabbage in contact with gaseous chlorine dioxide. Because of its potential to reduce the initial microbial load without negative effects on the sensory quality, in combination with its limited effects on nutrient content, a treatment with 80 mg/L peroxyacetic acid is preferable to decontaminate fresh-cut white cabbage.", "label": 1}

Standardized process water, a watery suspension of iceberg lettuce, was used for the experiments. First, the combination of PAA+LA was evaluated for water recycling. In this case disinfectant was added to standardized process water inoculated with Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157 (6logCFU/mL). Regression models were constructed based on the batch inactivation data and validated in industrial process water obtained from fresh-cut leafy green processing plants. The UV254(F) was the best indicator for PAA decay and as such for the E. coli O157 inactivation with PAA+LA. The disinfection efficiency of PAA+LA increased with decreasing pH. Furthermore, PAA+LA efficacy was assessed as a process water disinfectant to be used within the washing tank, using a dynamic washing process with continuous influx of E. coli O157 and organic matter in the washing tank. The process water contamination in the dynamic process was adequately estimated by the developed model that assumed that knowledge of the disinfectant residual was sufficient to estimate the microbial contamination, regardless the physicochemical load. Based on the obtained results, PAA+LA seems to be better suited than chlorine for disinfecting process wash water with a high organic load but a higher disinfectant residual is necessary due to the slower E. coli O157 inactivation kinetics when compared to chlorine.", "label": 1}
{"id": "4549", "title": "Adaptive and cross-adaptive responses of persistent and non-persistent Listeria monocytogenes strains to disinfectants", "abstract": "Persistent and non-persistent Listeria monocytogenes strains were tested for initial resistance and adaptive and cross-adaptive responses towards two quaternary ammonium compounds, alkyl-benzyl-dimethyl ammonium chloride and n-alkyldimethyl ethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, one tertiary alkylamine, 1,3-propanediamine-N-(3-aminopropyl)N-dodecyl, sodium hypochlorite and potassium persulphate. The initial resistance of two persistent and two non-persistent L. monocytogenes strains was observed to differ. Both types of strains adapted after a 2-h sublethal exposure to the quaternary ammonium compounds and the tertiary alkylamine, the highest increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) being 3-fold. Progressively increasing disinfecting concentrations at 10 and 37 \u00b0C resulted in adaptation of L. monocytogenes to all disinfectants except potassium sulphate. The highest observed increase in MIC was over 15-fold, from 0.63 to 10 ?g/ml of n-alkyldimethyl ethylbenzyl ammonium chloride. All strains reached approximately similar MICs. Stability of the increased resistance was tested by measuring MICs every seventh day for 28 days. The increased resistance to sodium hypochlorite disappeared in 1 week, but the quaternary ammonium compounds and the tertiary alkylamine showed increased resistance for 28 days. These results suggest that cellular changes due to adaptive responses continue to have an effect on the resistance some time after the exposure. All disinfectants were shown to cause cross-adaptation of L. monocytogenes, the highest increase in MIC being almost 8-fold. The only agent that L. monocytogenes could not be shown to cross-adapt to was potassium persulphate which did, however, cause cross-adaptation to the other disinfectants. The mechanism behind these adaptive responses seemed to be non-specific as cross-adaptation was observed not only between related but also unrelated disinfectants. These findings suggest that sustaining high disinfectant effectiveness may be unsuccessful by rotation, even when using agents with different mechanisms of action.", "label": 1}

In this work, preadsorptions of CI and SB were developed as simple methods for polysulfone ultrafiltration membrane modification. It was found that hydrogen bonding and Van Der Waals attraction could be responsible for the adsorptions of CI and SB onto membranes, respectively. After modification with CI or SB, the membrane surfaces became more hydrophilic. Membrane permeability improved when modified by SB while decreased a little when modified by CI. The modified membranes had an increase in PEG and BSA rejections and better antifouling properties with higher flux recovery ratios during filtration of a complex pharmaceutical wastewater. Moreover, membrane chlorine tolerance was elevated after modification with either agent, as shown by the mechanical property measurements.", "label": 0}

The role of food handlers therein has well been recognized. The aim of this study was to identify gaps in food handlers' education and to investigate possible associations between reported behavior, knowledge and awareness of NoV, and environmental presence of NoV. For this, face-to-face interviews were conducted using structured questionnaires in 1023 catering companies (i.e. restaurants mainly), 101 non-hospital health care centers, 52 hospital central kitchens and in 102 hospital in-patient units. In addition, three surface swabs were taken at each setting. Multivariate logistic regression was performed on data restricted to NoV high season months only, in which NoV was present in 21/374 (6%) catering companies and 37/233 (16%) institutional settings (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01). The two independent determinants of presence of NoV on environmental surfaces identified were being situated in an institutional setting and having an attitude to continue food handling while sick with vomiting complaints. Several gaps in education and training were identified, demonstrating that knowledge on NoV was low, although awareness of NoV was significantly higher among food handlers in institutional settings than in catering companies. This is the first time questionnaires and environmental testing have been combined in the same study to identify issues of improvement. Training on all important aspects of NoV according to the recently developed Codex Alimentarius guidelines to control viruses in food is strongly recommended.", "label": 0}

These plates were artificially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes in clean conditions, with organic soiling, or after 14 days of biofilm formation after which inactivation of the pathogen by Suma Tab D4 (sodium dichloroisocyanurate, 240 and 300 mg/liter), Suma Bac D10 (quaternary ammonium compound, 740 mg/liter), and bacteriophage suspension (Listex P100) was determined. Both chemical disinfectants performed well in suspension tests and in clean carrier tests according to the European standard with a reduction of more than 5 and 4 log units, respectively, of Listeria cells after 5 min of contact time. However, for the plates with grooves, the reduction could not meet the standard requirement, although a higher reduction of L. monocytogenes was observed in the shallow grooves compared with the deeper grooves. Furthermore, presence of food residues and biofilm reduced the effect of the disinfectants especially in the deep grooves, which was dependent on type of food substrate. Bacteriophages showed the best antimicrobial effect compared with the chemical disinfectants (sodium dichloroisocyanurate and quaternary ammonium compound) in most cases in the shallow grooves, but not in the deep grooves. The chlorine based disinfectants were usually less effective than quaternary ammonium compound. The results clearly demonstrate that surfaces with grooves influenced the antimicrobial effect of the chemical disinfectants and bacteriophages because the pathogen is protected in the deep grooves. The use of bacteriophages to inactivate pathogens on surfaces could be helpful in limited cases; however, use of large quantities in practice may be costly and phage-resistant strains may develop.", "label": 0}

The current control of C difficile endospores with liquid sporicides might have limited efficacy in the health care environment. Sporicidal wipes might offer additional control of surface bioburden and are now increasingly used, although there is little information about their efficacy against spores in practice. Methods Ten wipes were tested for sporicidal efficacy using a recently developed 3-stage protocol that measures the ability of the wipe to remove microbial bioburden from a surface, the potential for microbial transfer from the wipe to other surfaces, and the sporicidal activity of the wipe. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize the association of spores with the wipe fibers, and light scattering was used to measure the size of spore aggregates released from the wipes. Results The ability of the sporicidal wipes to remove C difficile spores from an inanimate surface ranged from 0.22 to 4.09 log10 spores removed within 10 seconds. One wipe did not remove any spores. None of the wipes demonstrated high sporicidal activity (ie, &gt;4 log10 reduction) within 5 minutes of contact time, except for a control wipe soaked in 5,000-ppm sodium hypochlorite. Only one wipe demonstrated some sporicidal activity after 5 minutes, with a 1.50 and a 3.74 log10 reduction in spore number of C difficile NCTC12727 and R20291 (ribotype 027), respectively. All but one wipe demonstrated that spores could be repeatedly transferred to other surfaces. Light-scattering data provided evidence that some wipes were able to break up spore aggregates, potentially releasing more spores onto the surface. Electron microscopy micrographs showed that spores might be loosely associated with some wipes, explaining the rapid release. Conclusion Although the use of sporicidal wipes might offer additional control of microbial burden on surfaces, current efficacy tests might be inadequate to reflect the activity of these wipes in practice. This can lead to the use of wipes that might not be appropriate for applications in the health care environment. Tighter control of labeling and appropriate efficacy tests are needed before antimicrobial wipes are released to the market.", "label": 0}

Growth, injury index, gas exchange, ion accumulation, pigment content, electrolyte leakage (EL) in addn. to antioxidant enzyme activities were measured after two weeks of salt treatments. Salinity did not alter the root or shoot biomass of the three Echinacea species studied. However, the survival rate varied among the species, with the highest rate (96.8%) in E. purpurea and the lowest one (70.7%) in E. angustifolia. In parallel, E. angustifolia plants showed high injury index and EL values compared to the other two species, which indicates its sensitivity to salinity-induced membrane damage even at the lowest salt concn. tested. This species showed a decrease in stomatal conductance, photosynthetic and transpiration rates at all salt concns.; while, in E. purpurea and E. pallida, the photosynthetic rate was reduced only at 75 and 100 mM NaCl. The decline in the leaf gas exchange was highly correlated with Na+ and Cl- contents in all Echinacea species. Although Na+ and Cl- concns. increased in both roots and shoots with increasing external salt concns., the accumulation of Na+ ions in E. angustifolia shoots was higher than in the other two species, resulting in a significant increase in Na+/K+ ratio. Furthermore, E. purpurea retained more Na+ ions in the roots than the other species suggesting higher efficiency in excluding Na+ from the shoots. E. purpurea showed increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities at all salt concns. On the other hand, salinity induced a redn. in catalase (CAT) activity with no change in glutathione reductase (GR) activity in any of the species.

Even though Acanthamoebae are frequently found in water, the cellular changes induced in Acanthamoebae have not been described in the literature. Acanthamoebae are pathogenic amoebae and may provide a reservoir for pathogenic bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila; it is consequently important to understand the response of this amoeba to chlorination, and our study was indeed aimed at examining cellular changes in Acanthamoebae following chlorination. Acanthamoeba trophozoites were treated at various chlorine concentrations (1\u20135 mg/L). A 3-log reduction in Acanthamoebae population was achieved with 5 mg/L of free chlorine. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry experiments indicated that chlorination induced cell permeabilization, size reduction and likely intracellular thiol concentration. Our data show that among the non-cultivable cells some remained impermeabilized (negative staining with propidium iodide), thereby suggesting that these cells might remained viable. A similar state is described in other microorganisms as a VBNC (viable but not cultivable) state. Electron microscopy observations illustrate drastic morphological changes: the pseudopods disappeared and subcellular components, such as mitochondrion, were pronouncedly affected.

The feed water contg. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was electrochem. treated while applying different electrode conditions. Depending on the applied c.d. and the exposure time, inactivation between 4- and 8-log of the targeted microorganisms could be achieved. The disinfection efficiency was driven by the generation of free chlorine as a function of chloride concn. in the water. A synergetic effect of generating both free chlorine and ozone in situ during the disinfection process resulted in an effective bactericidal impact. The formation of the undesired byproducts chlorate and perchlorate depended on the water matrix, the applied c.d. and the desired target disinfection level. In case of synthetic water with a low chloride concn. (20 mg L-1) and an applied c.d. of 167 mA cm-2, a 6-log inactivation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa could be achieved after 5 min of exposure. The overall energy consumption ranged between 0.3 and 0.6 kW h m-3 depending on the applied c.d. and water chem.

Due to the long sprouting period at ambient temps. and high humidity, germinating seeds contaminated with low pathogen levels (0.1 log CFU/g) can result in sprouts with high nos. (? 108 CFU/g) of pathogens. Currently, the recommended treatment method involves soaking seeds in 20,000 ppm (2%) calcium hypochlorite prior to germination. In this study, an alternative treatment involving soaking seeds in a carvacrol nanoemulsion was tested for its efficacy against Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Enteritidis (ATCC BAA-1045) or EGFP expressing E. coli O157:H7 (ATCC 42895) contaminated mung bean and alfalfa seeds. The antimicrobial treatment was performed by soaking inoculated seed batches in the spontaneous nanoemulsion (4000 or 8000 ppm) for 30 or 60 min. The spontaneous nanoemulsion was formed by titrating the oil phase (carvacrol and medium chain triglycerides) and water-sol. surfactant (Tween 80) into sodium citrate buffer. Following treatment, the nos. of surviving cells were detd. by suspending the seeds in TSB and performing plate counts and/or Most Probable No. (MPN) enumeration. Treated seeds were sprouted and tested for the presence of the appropriate pathogen. This treatment successfully inactivated low levels (2 and 3 log CFU/g) of S. Enteritidis and E. coli on either seed types when soaked for either 30 or 60 min at nanoemulsion concns. corresponding to 4000 (0.4%) or 8000 (0.8%) ppm carvacrol. Inoculated alfalfa seeds treated with 4000 ppm nanoemulsion, required a 60 min treatment time to show a similar 2-3 log redn. Complete inactivation was confirmed by germinating treated seeds and performing microbiol. testing. Total sprout yield was not compromised by any of the tested treatments. These results show that carvacrol nanoemulsions may be an alternative antimicrobial treatment method for mung bean and alfalfa seeds. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

Results Fecal indicator organisms, including Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. were isolated from 22 (27.5%) samples, and the majority (92.5%) of the water sources were contaminated with coliforms. A total of 170 bacterial isolates were obtained, including coliforms (70%), Enterococcus spp. (1.8%) and saprophytes (28.2%). A significant number of isolates were multi-drug resistant, which is a cause of concern. A comparison of the microbial quality of the water between urban and rural households revealed no significant differences.

This includes (1) a review on the physicochem. and microbiol. characteristics of rainwater and gray water to det. the necessary treatment options; (2) a review of individual components and potential treatment trains for hybrid systems; and (3) an evaluation of configurations for hybrid systems. The literature review reveals that both untreated rainwater and gray water are highly variable in quality and quantity, and so an equalization basin is proposed to normalize influent into a hybrid system. Both rainwater and gray water should not be reused without treatment due to the presence of pathogens such as Aeromonas, Salmonella, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus. Based on the literature, hybrid systems are categorized under three configurations: (a) sep. treatments of rainwater and gray water; (b) rainwater reused in washing machines prior to reuse as gray water; and (c) combined treatment of rainwater and gray water. In all three designs, rainwater requires only first-flush diversion and disinfection. Combined rainwater-gray water mixts. should be treated as gray water. Greywater requires chem., biol., and phys. treatment to meet non-potable reuse stds. Chem. processes are effective at removing solids, orgs., and surfactants in light gray water, whereas aerobic biol. processes are effective at orgs. removal in mixed and dark gray waters with high org. strength. Phys. processes, particularly membrane filtration, are recommended for polishing effluents from chem. or biol. treatment as membranes foul frequently and are costly. Subsequently, a combination of ozone or UV with chlorine is recommended to eradicate chlorine-resistant Cryptosporidium oocysts from hybrid rainwater-gray water systems and prevent microbial regrowth.

L. monocytogenes was sensitive to ozone (03), chlorine, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Planktonic cells of strain Scott A were completely destroyed by exposure to 0.25 ppm O-3 (8.29-log reduction, CFU per milliliter). Ozone's destruction of Scott A increased when the concentration was increased, with complete elimination at 4.00 ppm O-3 (8.07-log reduction, CFU per chip). A 16-fold increase in sanitizer concentration was required to destroy biofilm cells of L. monocytogenes versus planktonic cells of strain Scott A. Strain 10403S required an ozone concentration of 1.00 ppm to eliminate planktonic cells (8.16-log reduction, CFU per milliliter). Attached cells of the same strain were eliminated at a concentration of 4.00 ppm O-3 (7.47-log reduction, CFU per chip). At 100 ppm chlorine at 20degreesC, the number of planktonic cells of L. monocytogenes 10403S was reduced by 5.77 log CFU/ml after 5 min of exposure and by 6.49 log CFU/ml after 10 min of exposure.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for Perasafe(R), a recently introduced biocide, to contribute to control of C. difficile spores in the patient environment, in comparison with the chlorine-releasing agent sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC). These agents were evaluated against a water control, in a surface test on stainless steel and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) floor covering, materials commonly found in the hospital environment. The organisms studied were a toxigenic clinical isolate of C. difficile, and Bacillus atrophaeus (formerly B. subtilis var niger). The data indicate that in our in vitro system, Perasafe was significantly more active than NaDCC (1000 ppm available chlorine) against C. difficile spores dried on stainless steel surfaces, and against B. atrophaeus on PVC floor covering material, achieving mean log(10) reduction factors in viable counts of 6 and 5.5, respectively, at 10 min exposures. Perasafe appeared to be less lethal in 10 min exposures to C. difficile spores fixed on PVC floor covering material. In general, 1000 ppm chlorine generated from NaDCC showed lower log(10) reduction factors in viable counts at 10 min, ranging from 0.7 to 1.5, than Perasafe which ranged from 2.7 to 6.0.

{"id": "8878", "title": "Ferrates: greener oxidants with multimodal action in water treatment technologies", "abstract": "CONSPECTUS: One of the biggest challenges for humanity in the 21st century is easy access to purified and potable water. The presence of pathogens and toxins in water causes more than two million deaths annually, mostly among children under the age of five. Identifying and deploying effective and sustainable water treatment technologies is critical to meet the urgent need for clean water globally. Among the various agents used in the purification and treatment of water, iron-based materials have garnered particular attention in view of their special attributes such as their earth-abundant and environmentally friendly nature. In recent years, higher-valent tetraoxy iron(VI) (Fe(VI)O4(2-), Fe(VI)), commonly termed, ferrate, is being explored for a broad portfolio of applications, including a greener oxidant in synthetic organic transformations, a water oxidation catalyst, and an efficient agent for abatement of pollutants in water. The use of Fe(VI) as an oxidant/disinfectant and further utilization of the ensuing iron(III) oxides/hydroxide as coagulants are other additional attributes of ferrate for water treatment. This multimodal action and environmentally benign character of Fe(VI) are key advantages over other commonly used oxidants (e.g., chlorine, chlorine dioxide, permanganate, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone). This Account discusses current state-of-the-art applications of Fe(VI) and the associated unique chemistry of these high-valence states of iron. The main focus centers around the description and salient properties of ferrate species involving various electron transfer and oxygen-atom transfer pathways in terms of presently accepted mechanisms. The mechanisms derive the number of electron equivalents per Fe(VI) (i.e., oxidation capacity) in treating various contaminants. The role of pH in the kinetics of the reactions and in determining the removal efficiency of pollutants is highlighted; the rates of competing reactions of Fe(VI) with itself, water, and the contaminants, which are highly pH dependent, determine the optimum pH range of maximum efficacy. The main emphasis of this account is placed on cases where various modes of ferrate action are utilized, including the treatment of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing waste products, antibiotics, viruses, bacteria, arsenic, and heavy metals. For example, the oxidative degradation of N- and S-bearing contaminants by Fe(VI) yields either Fe(II) or Fe(III) via the intermediacy of Fe(IV) and Fe(V) species, respectively (e.g., Fe(VI) --> Fe(IV) --> Fe(II) and Fe(VI) --> Fe(V) --> Fe(III)). Oxidative transformations of antibiotics such as trimethoprim by Fe(VI) generate products with no residual antibiotic activity. Disinfection and inactivation of bacteria and viruses can easily be achieved by Fe(VI). Advanced applications involve the use of ferrate for the degradation of cyanobacteria and microcystin originating from algal blooms and for covalently embedding arsenic and heavy metals into the structure of formed magnetic iron(III) oxides, therefore preventing their leaching. Applications of state-of-the-art analytical techniques, namely, in situ Mossbauer spectroscopy, rapid-freeze electron paramagnetic resonance, nuclear forward scattering of synchrotron radiation, and mass spectrometry will enhance the mechanistic understanding of ferrate species. This will make it possible to unlock the true potential of ferrates for degrading emerging toxins and pollutants, and in the sustainable production and use of nanomaterials in an energy-conserving environment.", "label": 0}

From the plethora of crystal structures of protein-inhibitor complexes we have learned how molecules recognize each other geometrically, but we still have rather superficial understanding of why they bind to each other. This contribution surveys a series of 26 thrombin inhibitors with small systematic structural differences to elucidate the rationale for their widely deviating binding affinity from 185 mu M to 4 nM as recorded by enzyme kinetic measurements. Five well-resolved (resolution 2.30 - 1.47 angstrom) crystal structures of thrombin-inhibitor complexes and an apo-structure of the uncomplexed enzyme (1.50 angstrom) are correlated with thermodynamic data recorded by isothermal titration calorimetry with 12 selected inhibitors from the series. Taking solubility data into account, the variation in physicochemical properties allows conclusions to be reached about the relative importance of the enthalpic binding features as well as to estimate the importance of the parameters more difficult to capture, such as residual ligand entropy and desolvation properties. The collected data reveal a comprehensive picture of the thermodynamic signature that explains the so far poorly understood attractive force experienced by m-chloro-benzylamides to thrombin.

A greater than 5-log reduction of spores was achieved on each surface after the 15 mg/L 0102 gas treatment. The minimum ClO2 gas concentration needed to completely inactivate the inoculated spores was 30 mg/L for paper-and wood surfaces, 25 mg/L for epoxy surfaces, and 20 mg/L for plastic surfaces. The results of this study may provide insight into the parameters of effective decontamination procedures for Bacillus spores.", "label": 0}

This study was conducted to determine the effects of commercially available chilling systems on quality and safety of broiler meat. A total of 300 carcasses in 2 replications were randomly selected from a commercial processor and subjected to 3 systems: immersion chill (IC), air chill (AC), and combi in-line air chill (CIAC). Incidence of Salmonella and Campylobacter were determined on pre- and postchilled carcasses. Quality of the meat was evaluated by carcass yield, drip loss, cook loss, texture, moisture content, sensory qualities, and color (L*, a*, and b*) of boneless skinless breast fillets and skin-on drums. Shelf life of whole carcasses, breast fillets, and drums was also determined. The IC resulted in the most reduction of Salmonella (39.7%) and Campylobacter (43%) incidence due to the washing effect and presence of chlorine in the chilled water. There was no significant difference in shelf-life when comparing the chilling methods. The IC had the highest (P < 0.05) carcass yield (6.5%), followed by CIAC (+1.98.0%) and then AC (-1.10%). Drip loss, cook loss, and moisture content of breast fillets were not significantly different for all the chilling systems, but higher L* value was observed for breast fillets at 24 h postmortem treated with IC and CIAC. However, IC exhibited the lightest color and AC was darkest in the drum samples. Shear force of breast meat was significantly more tender for AC and CIAC.

We previously covered the existing patent literature in this area in 2010, but the notable progress made since then, has highlighted the need for an update to bring the reader up to date on recent developments. New patents in the areas of topically applied antibiotics and agents that can potentiate the action of existing antibiotics may extend their useful lifetime. Developments have also been made in biofilm-disrupting agents. Antimicrobial peptides are nature's way for many life forms to defend themselves against attack by pathogens. Silver has long been known to be a highly active antimicrobial but new inorganic metal derivatives based on bismuth, copper and gallium have emerged. Halogens such as chlorine and iodine can be delivered by novel technologies. A variety of topically applied antimicrobials include chitosan preparations, usnic acid, ceragenins and XF porphyrins. Natural product derived antimicrobials such as tannins and essential oils have also been studied. Novel techniques to deliver reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in situ have been developed. Light-mediated techniques include photodynamic therapy, ultraviolet irradiation, blue light, low-level laser therapy and titania photocatalysis. Passive immunotherapy employs antibodies against pathogens and their virulence factors. Finally an interesting new area uses therapeutic microorganisms such as phages, probiotic bacteria and protozoa to combat infections.", "label": 1}
{"id": "2859", "title": "A Method to Test the Efficacy of Handwashing for the Removal of Emerging Infectious Pathogens", "abstract": "Handwashing is widely recommended to prevent infectious disease transmission. However, little comparable evidence exists on the efficacy of handwashing methods in general. Additionally, little evidence exists comparing handwashing methods to determine which are most efficacious at removing infectious pathogens. Research is needed to provide evidence for the different approaches to handwashing that may be employed during infectious disease outbreaks. Here, a laboratory method to assess the efficacy of handwashing methods at removing microorganisms from hands and their persistence in rinse water is described. Volunteers' hands are first spiked with the test organism and then washed with each handwashing method of interest. Generally, surrogate microorganisms are used to protect human subjects from disease. The number of organisms remaining on volunteers' hands after washing is tested using a modified \"glove juice\" method: the hands are placed in gloves with an eluent and are scrubbed to suspend the microorganisms and make them available for analysis by membrane filtration (bacteria) or plaque assay (viruses/bacteriophages). Rinse water produced from the handwashing is directly collected for analysis. Handwashing efficacy is quantified by comparing the log reduction value between samples taken after handwashing to samples with no handwashing. Rinse water persistence is quantified by comparing rinse water samples from various handwashing methods to samples collected after handwashing with just water. While this method is limited by the need to use surrogate organisms to preserve the safety of human volunteers, it captures aspects of handwashing that are difficult to replicate in an in vitro study and fills research gaps on handwashing efficacy and the persistence of infectious organisms in rinse water.", "label": 1}

This study investigated the effectiveness of aqueous ozone in killing Escherichia. coli O157:H7 on alfalfa sprouts. Alfalfa sprouts inoculated with a five strain cocktail of E. coli O157:H7 were immersed in water containing 21 ppm ozone for 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 min at 4C. To increase availability and accessibility of ozone into sprout crevices, alternative treatments with continuous ozone sparging with and without pressurization were evaluated. Ozone treated sprouts were subjected to 12 psi hydrostatic pressure with pressurized ozone gas for 5 min to aid introduction of aqueous ozone into areas where pathogens may be hidden. Immersion of inoculated alfalfa sprouts (-10(7) CFU/g) in water containing 21 ppm ozone reduced the population of E. coli O157:H7 by 0.85 log(10) CFU/g after 64 min. There were no significant differences in 10910 reductions between the ozone treatments and control or between treatment times. With the exception of 2 min treatments, continuous ozone sparging resulted in reductions of 0.83 - 2.20 log(10) CFU/g, significantly higher (P less than or equal to 0.05) than reductions obtained by sparging with air (0.83 - 1.29 log(10) CFU/g). Application of low hydrostatic pressure (12 psi) for 5 min subsequent to continuous ozone sparging for 2 to 64 min reduced E. coli O157:H7 populations by 2 log(10) CFU/g. Reductions resulting from pressurized ozone treatments did not differ significantly from those resulting from unpressurized ozone treatments, except at 32 min. Ozone treatments did not exhibit a visible detrimental effect on sprout quality. Further investigation is required to develop methods applying ozone for the purpose of the contaminating sprouts and reducing health risks.

{"id": "3526", "title": "Risk assessment of use of cracked eggs in Canada", "abstract": "In 1992, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) amended its Egg Regulations to restrict movement of Canada C eggs (cracks) to federally registered processed egg stations for pasteurization. This was questioned by egg producers and some provinces on economic grounds. It was also in conflict with long-standing practices of marketing eggs in some provinces to retail stores, bakeries, restaurants and institutions or at the farm gate. In order to determine how much of a risk these eggs were to human health, AAFC requested that the Health Protection Branch (HPB) of Health Canada (HC) conduct a risk assessment. On the basis of outbreak data, the main hazard in these eggs was identified as Salmonella. Salmonellae may occasionally be present on shell eggs even after washing, and any Salmonella reaching the membranes can be transferred to an egg mixture through breaking, and will rapidly grow under improper storage conditions. A Relative Risk analysis showed that cracked eggs are 3 to 93 times more likely than uncracked shell eggs to cause outbreaks. A probability of illness of 1 in 3800 was derived from the 40 million cracked eggs produced in Canada and not pasteurized and the probable 10 500 illnesses arising from these. This was for the general population, but this would be greater for those who consume many shell eggs or would do so in an unsafe manner, or are more likely to be infected (5% of consumers who eat raw or lightly cooked eggs daily, rural communities with more opportunities for obtaining cracked eggs, and those who are immunocompromised and in institutions). Even though it is not possible to precisely determine the risk of salmonellosis through cracked eggs, this assessment indicated that there was enough of a concern that a management strategy was needed. Eight options for managing the risk were considered and ranked for acceptability by both HC and AAFC. Ideally, all cracked eggs should be broken and pasteurized, but this is impractical in certain regions of the country, and other options, such as sales to food processors operating under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and at the farm gate in marked cartons and under controlled conditions, were considered to be acceptable, whereas sales to institutions and bakeries were not. This is the first formal food-related microbiological risk assessment that HC has completed. Although this is a Canadian problem, any country producing eggs has to recognise that despite any regulations controlling the use of cracked eggs, economics will dictate that some of these will be consumed as whole eggs or egg products, and a management plan is desirable to limit hazardous practices associated with these eggs.", "label": 0}
{"id": "6554", "title": "Assessment of the national antimicrobial resistance monitoring system (NARMS) and its value in critical decision-making", "abstract": "This paper reviews the United States National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS). The data from this system have been used as the core basis of a recent proposal to stop the use of fluoroquinolones in poultry production, in an effort to reduce or remove a perceived threat to human health due to alleged increasing fluoro-quinolone resistance among human Campylobacter isolates. An increase in resistance has the potential to render fluoroquinolone therapy of human gastrointestinal infections less effective. This review finds no evidence in the NARMS data to suggest that a rise in resistant Campylobacter isolates has occurred since fluoroquinolones were introduced for use in poultry. In addition, this review identifies a number of shortcomings in the NARMS program. These include lack of an overall sampling design, biases in the collection of isolates from animal samples, non-compliance of state departments of public health with NARMS protocols, lack of such basic data as genotype information on the organisms isolated, and, for animal samples, lack of measurements of bacterial load. Taken together, these problems indicate that the present NARMS data very likely overestimate resistance levels, and, at best, do not provide reliable information to quantify the extent and temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter and other enteric organisms from human and animal populations. Ways to improve the quantitative rigor of the NARMS program and identify other data such as \u2018meta\u2019 data for human and animal samples, and data on the magnitude of other potential reservoirs of infection, including healthy humans, are suggested. Implementing these proposals would greatly enhance the value of the NARMS program as a tool for quantitative decision-making and aid in improving the quality of our food supply and human health care.", "label": 0}

{"id": "2448", "title": "Hyaluronidase To Enhance Nanoparticle-Based Photodynamic Tumor Therapy", "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered as a safe and selective way to treat a wide range of cancers as well as nononcological disorders. However, as oxygen is required in the process of PDT, the hypoxic tumor microenvironment has largely limited the efficacy of PDT to treat tumors especially those with relatively large sizes. To this end, we uncover that hyaluronidase (HAase), which breaks down hyaluronan, a major component of extracellular matrix (ECM) in tumors, would be able to enhance the efficacy of nanoparticle-based PDT for in vivo cancer treatment. It is found that the administration of HAase would lead to the increase of tumor vessel densities and effective vascular areas, resulting in increased perfusion inside the tumor. As a result, the tumor uptake of nanomicelles covalently linked with chlorine e6 (NM-Ce6) would be increased by approximately 2 folds due to the improved \"enhanced permeability and retention\" (EPR) effect, while the tumor oxygenation level also shows a remarkable increase, effectively relieving the hypoxia state inside the tumor. Those effects taken together offer significant benefits in greatly improving the efficacy of PDT delivered by nanoparticles. Taking advantage of the effective migration of HAase from the primary tumor to its drainage sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), we further demonstrate that this strategy would be helpful to the treatment of metastatic lymph nodes by nanoparticle-based PDT. Lastly, both enhanced EPR effect of NM-Ce6 and relieved hypoxia state of tumor are also observed after systemic injection of modified HAase, proving its potential for clinical translation. Therefore, our work presents a new concept to improve the efficacy of nanomedicine by modulating the tumor microenvironment.", "label": 0}

Biofilms represent a key challenge in the treatment of chronic wounds, as they are among the main reasons for delays in chronic wound healing. This in vitro study was aimed at evaluating the activity of a new acid-Oxidizing solution (AOS) on biofilm formation. Acid-oxidizing solution contains free chlorine species with stabilized hypochlorous acid in high concentration (> 95%) and is characterized by acidic (pH < 3) and super-oxidizing (Redox > 1000mV) features. Materials and Methods. A 3-dimensional in vitro model of reconstructed human epidermis was used to compare the activity of AS vs 2 reference products (RP) containing betaine and polyhexanide (RP1) and sodium hypochlorite and hypochlorous acid (RP2). Different approaches were used to assess the prevention and eradication of methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus biofilm by the study products.

Next, the effectiveness of CA and SH was evaluated throughout refrigerated storage (6.5\u00a0\u00b0C, 9 days) at a low and high contamination load, 5\u20136 and 8\u20139 log CFU.g?1, respectively. And lastly, sensory impact was assessed through a trained panel and instrumental color. Results indicated that there were not significant differences between the initial disinfection achieved by CA and SH. Storing infected spinach under refrigeration, between harvest and processing, played a key role not only in reducing their deterioration but also in assuring their safety by maintaining CA and SH effectiveness against the inoculated surrogates. Citric acid performance was better in controlling surrogates' regrowth along refrigerated storage. And there were not significant differences between CA and SH treated samples with respect to their sensory quality.

Irrigation is unarguably the most water demanding operation among the food supply chain, however, efforts from different sectors will collectively secure food for the world's population. Food processing is a key component of the food supply chain and its water footprint is of great consideration, not only because of the high-quality water used in the manufacturing of products but also for the significant volumes of pollutant wastewater generated. Different food sectors produce wastewater of different qualities, but for all cases water reconditioning and reuse offer opportunities to reduce water consumption and to contribute to a better water management in the food processing industry. Scope and approach The factors converging to implement such initiatives including, regulations in place, available technologies, food safety considerations, risk perceptions, water quality, environmental impacts and research needs are discussed herein. The goal of this review paper was to bring to the forefront of the debate the challenges and opportunities that water conservation initiatives offer, in order to produce more food with less water. Key findings Water reconditioning and reuse are technologically-feasible alternatives for the food processing industry to incorporate better water management and sustainability in food processing operations that are lacking. Successful implementation of conservation strategies is associated with the holistic evaluation of the intervention, providing information related to cost, risk, and environmental performance.", "label": 0}

In this study, the potential effects of chlorination on the genotoxicity of different biologically treated wastewater samples were investigated using the umutest. For the firsttime, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) was found to significantly influence genotoxicity during wastewater chlorination. After chlorination, the genotoxicity decreased in wastewater with a low NH3-N concentration (<10-20 mg/L), but it increased notably in wastewater with a high NH3-N concentration (>10-20 mg/L). By fractionating the DOM (dissolved organic matter) in wastewater into different fractions, it was found that the hydrophilic substances (HIS) fraction of DOM was the key fraction involved in decreasing genotoxicity during the chlorination of wastewater with a low NH3-N concentration, while the hydrophobic acids (HOA) fraction of DOM was the key fraction involved in increasing genotoxicity during chlorination of wastewater with a high NH3-N concentration. Furthermore, fluorescence spectroscopy analysis on different fractions indicated that some free or combined aromatic amino acids might produce highly genotoxic byproducts during the chlorination of wastewater with a high NH3-N content, and this was then demonstrated through experiments on the chlorination of free aromatic amino acids.", "label": 0}

Effects investigated included the color, carbon dioxide (CO2) generation, weight loss, and surface morphology of the lettuce during storage. Romaine lettuce pieces, with or without inoculation with a cocktail of three strains of E. coli O157: H7 (similar to 6 log CFU/g of lettuce), were packaged in a polyethylene terephthalate commercial clamshell container and treated at 34.8 kV at 1.1 kHz for 5 min by using a DACP treatment system equipped with a pin-type high-voltage electrode. Romaine lettuce samples were analyzed for inactivation of E. coli O157: H7, total mesophilic aerobes, and yeasts and molds, color, CO2 generation, weight loss, and surface morphology during storage at 4 degrees C for 7 days. The DACP treatment reduced the initial counts of E. coli O157: H7 and total aerobic microorganisms by similar to 1 log CFU/g, with negligible temperature change from 24.5 +/- 6 1.4 degrees C to 26.6 +/- 1.7 degrees C. The reductions in the numbers of E. coli O157: H7, total mesophilic aerobes, and yeasts and molds during storage were 0.8 to 1.5, 0.7 to 1.9, and 0.9 to 1.7 log CFU/g, respectively. DACP treatment, however, did not significantly affect the color, CO2 generation, weight, and surface morphology of lettuce during storage (P>0.05). Some mesophilic aerobic bacteria were sublethally injured by DACP treatment. The results from this study demonstrate the potential of applying DACP as a postpackaging treatment to decontaminate lettuce contained in conventional plastic packages without altering color and leaf respiration during posttreatment cold storage.", "label": 0}

Indeed, modern O2-transporting and storing mammalian red blood cell Hb and related muscle myoglobin (Mb) show vestigial NO dioxygenation activity with rate constants of 34\u201389 ?M?1 s?1. In support of a NOD function, microbial flavoHbs and Hbs catalyze O2-dependent cellular NO metabolism, protect cells from NO poisoning, and are induced by NO exposures. Red blood cell Hb, myocyte Mb, and flavoHb-like activities metabolize NO in the vascular lumen, muscle, and other mammalian cells, respectively, decreasing NO signalling and toxicity. HbFe(III)\u2013OO, HbFe(III)\u2013OONO and protein-caged [HbFe(III)\u2013O NO2] are proposed intermediates in a reaction mechanism that combines both O-atoms of O2 with NO to form nitrate and HbFe(III). A conserved Hb heme pocket structure facilitates the dioxygenation reaction and efficient turnover is achieved through the univalent reduction of HbFe(III) by associated reductases. High affinity flavoHb and Hb heme ligands, and other inhibitors, may find application as antibiotics and antitumor agents that enhance the toxicity of immune cell-derived NO or as vasorelaxants that increase NO signalling.", "label": 0}

In healthy tissue there was net Na and Cl absorption with JNa net approximating Isc. In contrast, inflamed colon exhibited significant reductions in PD, Isc, and R and increases in net serosa to mucosa flux of Na and Cl (JNasm and JClsm) resulting in net Na and Cl secretion. These results suggest that Na and Cl absorption in left colon is highly efficient in young children and that mucosal inflammation may seriously impair the colon's ability to conserve salt and water.", "label": 0}

Samples were rinsed and treated with the prototype washing solution containing lauryl sodium sulfate or NaCl-NaHCO3 for 3 min at 22 degreesC. Viability of E. coli O157:H7 cells was examined by plate counts at the surface and cut edge, and by confocal scanning microscopic (CSLM) observation of samples stained with Sytox green and Alexa 594 conjugated antibody against E. coli O157:H7 at intact leaf surface, stomata, and damaged tissue (0 to 10, 30 to 40, and 0 to 40 tm from the cut surface). Although both treatments caused significant log reductions in CFU at the surface and cut edge, log reductions were greater for the prototype washing solution (0.7 to 1.1 log CFU/cm(2)) than for NaCl-NaHCO3 (0.2 to 0.4 log CFU/cm(2)) (P < 0.05). Percentage of viability determined by CSLM for prototype washing solution was significantly greater at 30 to 40 Lm from cut surfaces than at 0 to 10 and 0 to 40 mu Lm from cut surfaces and intact surfaces (P < 0.05). Stomata provided moderate protection. NaCl-NaHCO3 was less effective than the prototype washing solution, and high percentages of E. coli O157:H7 cells remained viable at all sites except at the surface. The percent viabilities determined by CSLM were not significantly different from those determined by plate counts for NaCl-NaHCO3 treatment (P <greater than> 0.05). However, CSLM indicated significantly greater percent viability than plate counts for lettuce treated with the prototype washing solution (P < 0.05).

The aim of this study was to determine the quality of water plumbed in coolers from commercial stores in comparison with tap water in Italy. METHODS: For each sample, microbial parameters and chemical indicators of contamination were evaluated and information about the date of installation, time since last ordinary and extraordinary maintenance of water coolers was collected. RESULTS: In all samples the chemical parameters (nitrite, ammonium, free active chlorine residual) did not exceed the reference values of the drinking water regulation; the pH value in 86.8% samples of the carbonated waters was lower than the reference limit. The microbiological results indicated that the bacteria count at 22 degrees C and 37 degrees C was higher than the required values in 71% and 81% for the non-carbonated water and in 86% and 88% for the carbonated one, respectively. Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli were not detected in any of the water samples. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in only one sample of the tap water and in 28.9% and 23.7% of the non-carbonated and carbonated water samples, respectively. No statistically significant differences in bacterial counts at 22 degrees C and 37 degrees C have been found between the non-carbonated and carbonated water from the sampled coolers in relation with the time since the last filter was substituted. The bacteriological quality of tap water was superior to that of non-carbonated and carbonated water from coolers.

Hepcidins cloned from different kinds of fishes have been produced using exogenous expression systems, and their in vitro antimicrobial effects have been verified. However their in vivo effects on gut microbiota and gut health of hosts remain unclear. Here we performed a safety study of hepcidin so that it can be used to reduce microbial contaminations in the food and feed. In this study, Pichia pastoris-expressed Pseudosciaena crocea hepcidin (PC-hepc) was first assessed by simulated digestion tests and then administered to male and female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats in different concns. Subchronic toxicity testing, high throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota, and examns. on gut metab. and permeability were conducted. The results showed PC-hepc could be digested in simulated intestinal fluid but not in simulated gastric fluid. PC-hepc had no adverse effects on general health, except causing increase of blood glucose (still in the normal value range of this index) in all trial groups of female rats and intestinal inflammation in HD group of female rats. Community compn. of gut microbiota of female MD and HD groups shifted compared with control group, of which the decrease of genus Akkermansia might be related to the increase of blood glucose and intestinal inflammation. Significant increase of fecal nitroreductase activity was also obsd. in female MD and HD groups. Our results suggest the uses of exogenous PC-hepc in normal dosage are safe, however excess dosage of it may cause intestinal disorder of animals. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

Their hydrophilic nature combined with impressive chemical stability has yielded unique membranes with desalination capacity combined with chlorine tolerance. In this work, we explore the use of these polymers in support materials for thin film composite (TFC) membranes for forward osmosis (FO). Our reasoning behind their use lies in their intrinsic hydrophilicity, which promotes wetting and mass transfer in this support layer. We combine the use of this supporting material with different polyester (PET) nonwoven backings in order to better understand how backing choice and membrane midlayer material choice interrelate. By varying the degree of sulfonation in the support midlayer, along with selecting backing nonwovens with appropriate characteristics, our best membranes exhibited water flux of about 70 L m(-2) h(-1) using 1 M sodium chloride draw solution against deionized water in PRO mode. The use of the PET in these membrane imparted impressive mechanical properties while still keeping the structural parameter low (as low as 277 mu m). This is the lowest structural parameter of the fabric backed TFC membranes reported in the open literature. These results suggest that the combination of sulfonated polymer midlayers with appropriate PET nonwovens could serve to inform next generation membrane designs for forward and pressure retarded osmosis.

Salmonella is among the most frequently reported cause of foodborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis in the United States. Research was undertaken to determine the effects of sanitizer and hot water treatments on microbial populations on cantaloupe surfaces and to determine whether prior decontamination of melons by sanitizer treatment affects vulnerability to recontamination by Salmonella. Cantaloupes were sanitized with 200 ppm chlorine or 2.5% hydrogen peroxide solution for 2 min, or hot water (96 degrees C) for 2 min and were held at 5 degrees C for 24 h. Hot water treatments reduced the microbial populations on cantaloupe surface by 4.9 log reduction while H2O2 or chlorine caused approximately 2.6 log unit reduction on cantaloupe surfaces. When sanitized or hot water treated whole cantaloupes were re-inoculated with Salmonella. Higher populations of Salmonella were recovered from sanitized cantaloupes than from the untreated controls; recovery was greater from hot water treated cantaloupes than from cantaloupes treated with chlorine or hydrogen peroxide.

GRL-10413 blocked the infectivity and replication of HIV-1NL4-3 variants selected by use of atazanavir, lopinavir, or amprenavir (APV) at concentrations of up to 5 muM (EC50 = 0.0021 to 0.0023 muM). GRL-10413 also maintained its strong antiviral activity against multidrug-resistant clinical HIV-1 variants isolated from patients who no longer responded to various antiviral regimens after long-term antiretroviral therapy. The development of resistance against GRL-10413 was significantly delayed compared to that against APV. In addition, GRL-10413 showed favorable central nervous system (CNS) penetration properties as assessed with an in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) reconstruction system. Analysis of the crystal structure of HIV-1 protease in complex with GRL-10413 demonstrated that the modified P1 moiety of GRL-10413 has a greater hydrophobic surface area and makes greater van der Waals contacts with active site amino acids of protease than in the case of darunavir. Moreover, the chlorine substituent in the P1 moiety interacts with protease in two distinct configurations. The present data demonstrate that GRL-10413 has desirable features for treating patients infected with wild-type and/or multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants, with favorable CNS penetration capability, and that the newly modified P1 moiety may confer desirable features in designing novel anti-HIV-1 PIs.", "label": 0}

The legislation provides the following limits for wastewater: Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentration below 5000 CFU 100 mL(-1) (recommended value), active chlorine concentration below 0.2 mg L-1 and lack of acute toxicity. The compliance with these conditions is shown by means of the study of correct disinfectant dosage, which also depends on wastewater characteristics. An investigation at the regional level (from 2013 to 2016) shows a correlation between acute toxicity discharge and disinfection treatment through chemical reagents (mainly with the use of chlorine compounds and peracetic acid). The experimental work concerns two active sludge WWTPs in northern Italy with small capacity (10,000-12,000 PE). The activities provide the assessment of microbiological quality and toxicity of WWTPs effluents in relation to the dosage of sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid, by means of the use of batch tests. The results show that with similar disinfectant dosage and comparable initial E. coli concentration, peracetic acid exhibits the best performance in terms of microbial removal (with removal yields up to 99.99%).

Screening for a better microbial protein secretor free of cellulase selected Bacillus cereus No. 518. A bidirectional vector plasmid (pMK3) was employed to carry the cloned gene into this B. cereus strain. Transformation was carried out by electroporation. Total xylanase production by the new pMK3-borne gene in B. cereus was similar to that from E. coli but the xylanase was shown to be normally secreted. The xylanase gene products from the E. coli and B. cereus hosts were shown to function identically. Both xylanases improved the delignification of unbleached softwood and hardwood kraft pulps, thus reducing the Cl2 required to achieve a given degree of bleaching, without altering the physical properties of the fibers.

Since the 2001 Bacillus anthracis bioterrorist attacks, additional efforts have been aimed at research to characterize biothreat organisms in regards to their susceptibility to disinfectants and technologies currently in use for potable water. Here, we present a review of research relevant to disinfection of bacteria with the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety, and their potential surrogates. The efficacy of chlorine, monochloramine, chlorine dioxide, and ultraviolet light to inactivate each organism in suspension is described. The complexities of disinfection under varying water conditions and when the organisms are associated with biofilms in distribution systems are discussed.", "label": 1}
{"id": "2761", "title": "The effect of sodium thiosulfate dechlorination on fecal indicator bacteria enumeration: laboratory and field data", "abstract": "In microbiological water quality testing, sample dechlorination with sodium thiosulfate is recommended to ensure that results accurately reflect the water quality at sample collection. Nevertheless, monitoring institutions in low-resource settings do not always dechlorinate samples, and there is limited research describing how this practice impacts drinking water quality results. The effect of dechlorination on indicator bacteria counts was evaluated by spiking laboratory water with five Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentrations (10(4)-10(8) CFU/100 mL), chlorinating at six doses (0-0.6 mg/L), holding samples with and without sodium thiosulfate for 5-7 hours, and enumerating E. coli by membrane filtration with m-lauryl sulfate media. Additionally, sub-Saharan African water suppliers enumerated thermotolerant coliform by membrane filtration in paired chlorinated water samples collected with and without sodium thiosulfate. Across all E. coli and chlorine doses in the laboratory, and all field tests, samples held without sodium thiosulfate had lower bacteria counts (p < 0.001). Additionally, chlorinated water supply samples held without sodium thiosulfate had an 87.5% false negative rate. Results indicate the importance of dechlorinating microbiological water quality samples, discarding data from chlorinated samples collected without dechlorination, and reinforcing dechlorination recommendations in resource-limited environments to improve water safety management.", "label": 1}
{"id": "2432", "title": "Response of Simulated Drinking Water Biofilm Mechanical and Structural Properties to Long-Term Disinfectant Exposure", "abstract": "Mechanical and structural properties of biofilms influence the accumulation and release of pathogens in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS). Thus, understanding how long-term residual disinfectants exposure affects biofilm mechanical and structural properties is a necessary aspect for pathogen risk assessment and control. In this study, elastic modulus and structure of groundwater biofilms was monitored by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) during three months of exposure to monochloramine or free chlorine. After the first month of disinfectant exposure, the mean stiffness of monochloramine- or free-chlorine-treated biofilms was 4 to 9 times higher than those before treatment. Meanwhile, the biofilm thickness decreased from 120 +/- 8 mu m to 93 +/- 6-107 +/- 11 mu m. The increased surface stiffness and decreased biofilm thickness within the first month of disinfectant exposure was presumably due to the consumption of biomass. However, by the second to third month during disinfectant exposure, the biofilm mean stiffness showed a 2- to 4-fold decrease, and the biofilm thickness increased to 110 +/- 7-129 +/- 8 mu m, suggesting that the biofilms adapted to disinfectant exposure. After three months of the disinfectant exposure process, the disinfected biofilms showed 2-5 times higher mean stiffness (as determined by AFM) and 6-13-fold higher ratios of protein over polysaccharide, as determined by differential staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), than the nondisinfected groundwater biofilms. However, the disinfected biofilms and nondisinfected biofilms showed statistically similar thicknesses (t test, p > 0.05), suggesting that long-term disinfection may not significantly remove net biomass. This study showed how biofilm mechanical and structural properties vary in response to a complex DWDS environment, which will contribute to further research on the risk assessment and control of biofilm-associated-pathogens in DWDS.", "label": 1}
{"id": "6805", "title": "Features and potentials of ATP-site directed CK2 inhibitors", "abstract": "A panel of quite specific, fairly potent and cell-permeable inhibitors of protein kinase CK2 belonging to the classes of condensed polyphenolic compounds, tetrabromobenzimidazole/triazole derivatives and indoloquinazolines have been developed, with Ki values in the submicromolar range. Nine structures have been solved to date of complexes between the catalytic ? subunit of CK2 and a number of these compounds, many of which display a remarkable specificity toward CK2 as compared to a panel of &gt;30 kinases tested. The structural basis for such selectivity appears to reside in the shape and size of a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the ATP binding site where these ATP competitive ligands are entrapped mainly by van der Waals interactions and by an energy contribution derived from the hydrophobic effect. In CK2, this cavity is smaller than in the majority of other protein kinases due to a number of unique bulky apolar residues. Consequently, the replacement of two of these residues (V66 and I174) in human CK2 alpha with alanines gives rise to mutants, which are markedly less susceptible than wild type to these classes of inhibitors. Cell-permeable CK2 inhibitors have been successfully employed, either alone or in combination with CK2 mutants refractory to inhibition, to dissect signalling pathways affected by CK2 and/or to validate the identification of in vivo targets of this pleiotropic kinase. Moreover, the remarkable pro-apoptotic efficacy of these compounds toward cell lines derived from a wide spectrum of tumors, disclose the possibility that in perspective CK2 inhibitors might become leads for the development of anti-cancer drugs.", "label": 0}

Methods Sixty first and second mandibular molars were used. Their mesiobuccal canals were prepared with the Reciproc System (VDW, Munich, Germany). The canals were irrigated with 10\u00a0mL saline during instrumentation. The teeth were randomly divided into 3 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a020), according to the irrigation solution to be used after instrumentation: group PAA (5\u00a0mL 1% PAA), group EDTA/sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (5\u00a0mL 17% EDTA followed by 5\u00a0mL 2.5% sodium hypochlorite), and group S (5\u00a0mL saline). Microbiological samples were collected before instrumentation and after final irrigation. Bacterial quantification was performed by counting the number of colony-forming units (CFUs/mL). The results were analyzed by the nonparametric Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results The 3 groups showed a significant reduction (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.05) in CFUs/mL after final irrigation. PAA and NaOCl associated with EDTA produced a significantly higher reduction in CFUs/mL (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.05) compared with saline. There was no statistically significant difference between PAA and EDTA + 2.5% NaOCl (P\u00a0&gt;\u00a0.05). Conclusions According to the results of the present study, the effectiveness of 1% PAA was similar to that of 17% EDTA + 2.5% NaOCl in cleaning curved root canals contaminated with E. faecalis.", "label": 1}
{"id": "6626", "title": "Streptomyces spores from mouldy houses induce nitric oxide, TNF? and IL-6 secretion from RAW264.7 macrophage cell line without causing subsequent cell death", "abstract": "The current view is that only bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and gamma interferon (IFN?) are able to alone activate macrophages to secrete nitric oxide (NO), probably a causative agent of cell death. Moreover, some cytokines and gram positive pathogens together with IFN? induce NO-production. Surprisingly, spores of Streptomyces sp., which are mesophilic gram-positive bacteria found in mouldy houses, stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF?) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and induced the expression of inducible NO-synthase (iNOS) with a subsequent NO-production. However, the Streptomyces spores did not kill NO-producing macrophages, as did both LPS and gram negative bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens, strong inducers of cytokine- and NO-production. These results imply that Streptomyces sp., induced cytokine and NO-secretion, may play a role in the responses evoked by exposure to these microbes. Moreover, factors other than, or in addition to NO, are necessary for cytotoxicity in murine macrophages.", "label": 0}
{"id": "3148", "title": "Aggregation of Adenovirus 2 in Source Water and Impacts on Disinfection by Chlorine", "abstract": "It is generally accepted that viral particles in source water are likely to be found as aggregates attached to other particles. For this reason, it is important to investigate the disinfection efficacy of chlorine on aggregated viruses. A method to produce adenovirus particle aggregation was developed for this study. Negative stain electron microscopy was used to measure aggregation before and after addition of virus particles to surface water at different pH and specific conductance levels. The impact of aggregation on the efficacy of chlorine disinfection was also examined. Disinfection experiments with human adenovirus 2 (HAdV2) in source water were conducted using 0.2 mg/L free chlorine at 5 degrees C. Aggregation of HAdV2 in source water (>/=3 aggregated particles) remained higher at higher specific conductance and pH levels. However, aggregation was highly variable, with the percentage of particles present in aggregates ranging from 43 to 71 %. Upon addition into source water, the aggregation percentage dropped dramatically. On average, chlorination CT values (chlorine concentration in mg/L x time in min) for 3-log10 inactivation of aggregated HAdV2 were up to three times higher than those for dispersed HAdV2, indicating that aggregation reduced the disinfection rate. This information can be used by water utilities and regulators to guide decision making regarding disinfection of viruses in water.", "label": 1}

Bromodichloromethyl-4-chloro-3-nitrophenyl sulfone (named compound 6); dichloromethyl-4-chloro-3-nitrophenyl sulfone (named 7); and chlorodibromomethyl-4-hydrazino-3-nitrophenyl sulfone (named 11) on inhibition of planktonic cells' growth, leucine arylamidase APE2 gene expression, and adhesion to epithelial cells were investigated. In vitro anti-. Candida activities were determined against wild-types, and the morphogenesis mutants: ?. efg1 and ?. cph1. MICs of compounds 6, 7 and 11 (concentrated at 0.25-16. ?g/ml) were determined using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Broth Microdilution Method (M27-A3 Document). APE2 expression was analyzed using RT-PCR; relative quantification was normalized against ACT1 in cells growth in YEPD and on Caco-2 cell line. Adherence assay of C. albicans to Caco-2 was performed in 24-well-plate.The structure activity relationship suggested that sulfone containing hydrazine function at C-1 (compound 11) showed higher antifungal activity (cell inhibition% = 100 at 1-16. ?g/ml) than the remaining sulfones with chlorine at C-1. ?. cph1/?. efg1 was highly sensitive to compound 11, while the sensitivity was reduced in ?. cph1/?. efg1::. EFG1 (% = 100 at 16-fold higher concentration). Compound 11 significantly affected adherence to epithelium (P ?0.05) and hyphae formation. The APE2 up-regulation plays role in sulfones' resistance on MAP kinase pathway. Either CPH1 or EFG1 play a role in the resistance mechanism in sulfones. The strain-dependent phenomenon is a factor in the sulfone resistance mechanism. Sulfones' mode of action was attributed to reduced virulence arsenal in terms of adhesiveness and pathogenic potential related to the APE2 expression and morphogenesis.", "label": 0}
{"id": "4149", "title": "Emerging nitrogenous disinfection byproducts: Transformation of the antidiabetic drug metformin during chlorine disinfection of water", "abstract": "As an environmental contaminant of anthropogenic origin metformin is present in the high ng/L- up to the low mug/L-range in most surface waters. Residues of metformin may lead to the formation of disinfection by-products during chlorine disinfection, when these waters are used for drinking water production. Investigations on the underlying chemical processes occurring during treatment of metformin with sodium hypochlorite in aqueous medium led to the discovery of two hitherto unknown transformation products. Both substances were isolated and characterized by HPLC-DAD, GC-MS, HPLC-ESI-TOF, (1)H-NMR and single-crystal X-ray structure determination. The immediate major chlorination product is a cyclic dehydro-1,2,4-triazole-derivate of intense yellow color (Y; C4H6ClN5). It is a solid chlorimine of limited stability. Rapid formation was observed between 10 degrees C and 30 degrees C, as well as between pH 3 and pH 11, in both ultrapure and tap water, even at trace quantities of reactants (ng/L-range for metformin, mg/L-range for free chlorine). While Y is degraded within a few hours to days in the presence of light, elevated temperature, organic solvents and matrix constituents within tap water, a secondary degradation product was discovered, which is stable and colorless (C; C4H6ClN3). This chloroorganic nitrile has a low photolysis rate in ambient day light, while being resistant to heat and not readily degraded in the presence of organic solvents or in the tap water matrix. In addition, the formation of ammonia, dimethylamine and N,N-dimethylguanidine was verified by cation exchange chromatography.", "label": 0}

A series of 26 synthetic tetraazamacrocyclic derivatives and their metal complexes were synthesized, characterized, and screened for antischistosomal activity by application of a phased screening program. The compounds were first screened against newly transformed schistosomula (NTS) of harvested Schistosoma mansoni cercariae, then against adult worms, and finally, in vivo using the mouse model of S. mansoni infection. At a concentration of 33 ?M, incubation with a total of 12 compounds resulted in the mortality of NTS at the 62% to 100% level. Five of these showing 100% inhibition of viability of NTS at 10 ?M were selected for further screening for determination of the 50 inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) against both NTS and adult worms. Against NTS, all 5 compounds showed IC50s comparable to the IC50 of the standard drug, PZQ (0.87 to 9.65 ?M for the 5 compounds versus 2.20 ?M for PZQ). Three of these, which are the bisquinoline derivative of cyclen and its Fe2+ and Mn2+ complexes, showed micromolar IC50s (1.62 ?M, 1.34 ?M, and 4.12 ?M, respectively, versus 0.10 ?M for PZQ) against adult worms. In vivo, the worm burden reductions were 12.3%, 88.4%, and 74.5%, respectively, at a single oral dose of 400 mg/kg of body weight. The Fe2+ complex exhibited activity in vivo comparable to that of PZQ, pointing to the discovery of a novel drug lead for schistosomiasis.", "label": 0}

Results Exercise bestows benefits to oncology patients with respect to fatigue, functional and physical performance. In addition, exercise exhibits promising effects in the maintenance of the body composition, metabolism, immune and psychological functioning. International Societies recommend 30 min of moderate aerobic physical activity at least five times per week, strength training three times per week, and flexibility exercises. Exercise must be prescribed on an individual basis, taking age, previous activity level, tolerance to exertion, diagnosis, disease stage, therapeutic approach, and the patients\u2019 comorbidities into account.

HIV-1 capsid (CA) and human cyclophilin A (CypA) play essential roles in these processes. We designed and synthesized a series of thiourea compounds as HIV-1 assembly and disassembly dual inhibitors targeting both HIV-1 CA protein and human CypA. The SIV-induced syncytium antiviral evaluation indicated that all of the inhibitors displayed antiviral activities in SIV-infected CEM cells at the concentration of 0.6\u201315.8 ?M for 50% of maximum effective rate. Their abilities to bind CA and CypA were determined by ultraviolet spectroscopic analysis, fluorescence binding affinity and PPIase inhibition assay. Assembly studies in vitro demonstrated that the compounds could potently disrupt CA assembly with a dose-dependent manner. All of these molecules could bind CypA with binding affinities (Kd values) of 51.0\u2013512.8 ?M. Fifteen of the CypA binding compounds showed potent PPIase inhibitory activities (IC50 values &lt; 1 ?M) while they could not bind either to HIV-1 Protease or to HIV-1 Integrase in the enzyme assays. These results suggested that 15 compounds could block HIV-1 replication by inhibiting the PPIase activity of CypA to interfere with capsid disassembly and disrupting CA assembly.", "label": 0}

In recent years, several synthetic routes have been developed to obtain bioactive molecules derived from lapachones. In this mini-review, we focus on the synthetic aspects and strategies used to design these compounds and on the biological activities of these substances for the development of drugs against the neglected diseases leishmaniasis and Chagas disease as well as malaria, tuberculosis and cancer. Three strategies used to develop bioactive naphthoquinoidal compounds are discussed: (i) C-ring modification, (ii) redox centre modification and (iii) A-ring modification. Among these strategies, reactions such as copper-catalysed azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition (click chemistry), palladium-catalysed cross couplings, and heterocyclisations will be discussed for the development of naphthoquinoidal compounds against Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania and cancer.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for Perasafe, a recently introduced biocide, to contribute to control of C. difficile spores in the patient environment, in comparison with the chlorine-releasing agent sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC). These agents were evaluated against a water control, in a surface test on stainless steel and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) floor covering, materials commonly found in the hospital environment. The organisms studied were a toxigenic clinical isolate of C. difficile, and Bacillus atrophaeus (formerly B. subtilis var niger). The data indicate that in our in vitro system, Perasafe was significantly more active than NaDCC (1000 ppm available chlorine) against C. difficile spores dried on stainless steel surfaces, and against B. atrophaeus on PVC floor covering material, achieving mean log10 reduction factors in viable counts of 6 and 5.5, respectively, at 10 min exposures. Perasafe appeared to be less lethal in 10 min exposures to C. difficile spores fixed on PVC floor covering material. In general, 1000 ppm chlorine generated from NaDCC showed lower log10 reduction factors in viable counts at 10 min, ranging from 0.7 to 1.5, than Perasafe which ranged from 2.7 to 6.0.

Four types of sulfonamide (sulfanilamide, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfadimethoxine) were chosen as substrates, with sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant. A laboratory-scale nanofiltration system was used to conduct the following sets of experiment: (1) a pre-chlorination system, where the free active chlorine (FAC) was added to the membrane influent; and (2), a post-chlorination system, where the FAC was added to the membrane effluent. Overall, the pre-disinfection nanofiltration system showed higher sulfonamide removal efficiency compared to the post-chlorination nanofiltration system (>99.5% versus >89.5%). In the case of limited FAC ([FAC]0: [sulfonamide]0</=1), the removal efficiency for the post-chlorination nanofiltration system was higher, due to the prior nanofiltration process that could remove 12.5% to 80% of sulfonamide.

Through protein engineering, we have been able to modify a protein to mimic this reaction. A unique quinone-binding site was engineered into the Escherichia coli cytochrome 6552 by introducing a cysteine within the hydrophobic interior of the protein. Various quinones, such as p-benzoquinone and 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, were then covalently attached to the protein through a cysteine sulfur addition reaction to the quinone ring. The cysteine placement was designed to bind the quinone ? 10 \u00c5 from the edge of the bound porphyrin. Fluorescence measurements confirmed that the bound hydroquinone is incorporated toward the protein's hydrophobic interior and is partially solvent-shielded. The bound quinones remain redox-active and can be oxidized and rereduced in a two-electron process at neutral pH. The semiquinone can be generated at high pH by a one-electron reduction, and the midpoint potential of this can be adjusted by ?500 mV by binding different quinones to the protein. The heme-binding site of the modified cytochrome was then reconstituted with the chlorophyll analogue zinc chlorin e6. By using EPR and fast optical techniques, we show that, in the various chlorin-protein-quinone complexes, light-induced electron transfer can occur from the chlorin to the bound oxidized quinone but not the hydroquinone, with electron transfer rates in the order of 108 s-1.", "label": 0}

Magnetic ion exchange (MIEX) resin treatment is well-studied in drinking water for removal of DOM from natural waters. There are fewer studies evaluating MIEX treatment of waste waters, and there is no previous work evaluating MIEX treatment of landfill leachate. This work systematically evaluated MIEX treatment of stabilized landfill leachate and evaluated the results in the context of previous studies of MIEX treatment of natural and waste waters. Five leachates from four landfills were evaluated as a function of MIEX resin dose, mixing time, and regeneration efficiency. MIEX resin removed DOM from landfill leachate, even in the presence of a reported high background concn. of inorg. ions. MIEX resin that was exhausted with leachate DOM was effectively regenerated with a concd. NaCl soln., and regenerated MIEX resin performed similarly to virgin resin. For a majority of the leachates, the removal trend for MIEX resin was color > UV-absorbing substances > dissolved org. carbon ? COD > total nitrogen. Finally, MIEX resin removed a wider range of DOM from leachate than coagulation. The most important contribution of this work is that MIEX treatment of leachate followed very similar trends as MIEX treatment of natural waters, which will allow previous MIEX data to be used to est. the treatment efficiency of other waste waters.

People often wear water-resistant sunscreen formulations during extended period of water activities in the summer to protect skin from harmful UV rays. We wanted to evaluate whether sunscreen formulations can also serve as additional water barriers to help mitigate the disruption in stratum corneum caused by constant exposure to water. METHODS: We conducted trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement in a controlled water patch (including salt and chlorine water) model and then applied this relevant model to study the effects of pre-treatments of sunscreen sprays and stick. We also conducted water sorption-desorption test in vivo with and without sunscreens. Finally, we studied the effect of constant water exposure combined with a known irritant, sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), in a randomized clinical trial. RESULTS: We found that application of sunscreen formulations help mitigate water-induced barrier disruption by repelling water at skin surface. Pre-treatment of sunscreen also statistically decreased the irritation in an acute patch test model. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrophobic sunscreen formulations can help protect skin from extended water exposure by serving as additional water barriers.", "label": 0}

Such common use brings recreational water-associated illness risk. Disinfection is an important application to prevent RWIs resulting from microbiological agents. This study aimed to calculate the non-compliance frequencies emerging in the use of different chemical disinfectants in swimming pools in Turkey and compare the effectiveness of different disinfection methods in the prevention of microbiological non-compliances. We evaluated the analysis results of a total of 79 087 pool water samples taken from inspection semi-public and public swimming pools in Turkey, where chemical disinfection was used, for routine monitoring purposes in the first eight months of 2015 and 2016. The minimum non-compliance for the total numbers of colony, total coliform, E. coli and P. aeruginosa parameters was determined in pools where chlorine and chlorine compounds were used (0.9-1.0% and 0.4-1.1%, respectively) whereas the highest non-compliance was found in pools using hydrogen peroxide + biguanide (5.5-5.3% and 3.1-9.1%, respectively). The applied statistical tests revealed a statistically significant difference between disinfection methods in terms of non-compliance frequency of all microbiological parameters (p < 0.0000001). This study found that chlorine in semi-public and public pools to be more effective against microbiological pollution than other chemical disinfection methods. This result is extremely important as it emphasises that other methods may be a suitable option in small, domestic pools with low user density whereas chlorine should be the primary preference especially in semi-public and public pools with high user density.", "label": 1}

An increased glucose consumption rate has been observed in malignant cells. Warburg (Nobel Laureate in medicine) postulated that the respiratory process of malignant cells was impaired and that the transformation of a normal cell to malignant was due to defects in the aerobic respiratory pathways. Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi (Nobel Laureate in medicine) also viewed cancer as originating from insufficient availability of oxygen. Oxygen by itself has an inhibitory action on malignant cell proliferation by interfering with anaerobic respiration (fermentation and lactic acid production). Interestingly, during cell differentiation (where cell energy level is high) there is an increased cellular production of oxidants that appear to provide one type of physiological stimulation for changes in gene expression that may lead to a terminal differentiated state. The failure to maintain high ATP production (high cell energy levels) may be a consequence of inactivation of key enzymes, especially those related to the Krebs cycle and the electron transport system. A distorted mitochondrial function (transmembrane potential) may result. This aspect could be suggestive of an important mitochondrial involvement in the carcinogenic process in addition to presenting it as a possible therapeutic target for cancer. Intermediate metabolic correction of the mitochondria is postulated as a possible non-toxic therapeutic approach for cancer.", "label": 0}

{"id": "2263", "title": "Reduction of Pesticide Residues on Fresh Vegetables with Electrolyzed Water Treatment", "abstract": "Degradation of the 3 pesticides (acephate, omethoate, and dimethyl dichloroviny phosphate [DDVP]) by electrolyzed water was investigated. These pesticides were commonly used as broad-spectrum insecticides in pest control and high-residual levels had been detected in vegetables. Our research showed that the electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) water (pH 2.3, available chlorine concentration:70 ppm, oxidation-reduction potential [ORP]: 1170 mV) and the electrolyzed reducing (ER) water (pH 11.6, ORP: -860 mV) can reduce the pesticide residues effectively. Pesticide residues on fresh spinach after 30 min of immersion in electrolyzed water reduced acephate by 74% (EO) and 86% (ER), omethoate by 62% (EO) and 75% (ER), DDVP by 59% (EO) and 46% (ER), respectively. The efficacy of using EO water or ER water was found to be better than that of using tap water or detergent (both were reduced by more than 25%). Besides spinach, the cabbage and leek polluted by DDVP were also investigated and the degradation efficacies were similar to the spinach. Moreover, we found that the residual level of pesticide residue decreased with prolonged immersion time. Using EO or ER water to wash the vegetables did not affect the contents of Vitamin C, which inferred that the applications of EO or ER water to wash the vegetables would not result in loss of nutrition. Practical Application With increased consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, presence of pesticide residues in fresh produce has become a health concern for consumers due to potential long-term adverse effects on human health. In an attempt to find a better method to reduce the pesticide residues, the efficacy of electrolyzed oxidizing water (EO water) and electrolyzed reducing water (ER water) treatments on eliminating 3 pesticides (acephate, omethoate, and DDVP) commonly used in growing vegetables was investigated. This study demonstrated that electrolyzed water could be used to reduce pesticide residues on fresh vegetable and have a positive impact on ensuring safety of fresh vegetables for consumption.", "label": 0}

The individual effects on yield and environmental impacts have been studied extensively, but the comprehensive effect when straw returning and domestic sewage irrigation are combined together has seldom been reported. This study was conducted to examine the effects of straw returning and domestic sewage irrigation on rice yields, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and ammonia (NH3) volatilization from paddy fields from 2015 to 2016. The results showed that the rice yield was not affected by the irrigation water sources and straw returning under the same total N input, which was similar in both years. Due to the rich N in the domestic sewage, domestic sewage irrigation could reduce approx. 45.2% of chem. nitrogen fertilizer input without yield loss. Compared to straw removal treatments, straw returning significantly increased the CH4 emissions by approx. 7-9-fold under domestic sewage irrigation and 13-14-fold under tap water irrigation. Straw returning also increased the N2O emissions under the two irrigation water types. In addn., the seasonal NH3 volatilization loss was significantly increased by 88.8% and 61.2% under straw returning compared to straw removal in 2015 and 2016, resp. However, domestic sewage irrigation could decrease CH4 emissions by 24.5-26.6%, N2O emissions by 37.0-39.0% and seasonal NH3 volatilization loss by 27.2-28.3% under straw returning compared to tap water irrigation treatments. Global warming potentials (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensities (GHGI) were significantly increased with straw returning compared with those of straw removal, while they were decreased by domestic sewage irrigation under straw returning compared to tap water irrigation. Significant interactions between straw returning and domestic sewage irrigation on NH3 volatilization loss, CH4 and N2O emissions were obsd. The results indicate that domestic sewage irrigation combined with straw returning could be an environmentally friendly and resource-saving agricultural management measure for paddy fields with which to reduce the chem. N input, GHG emissions, and NH3 volatilization loss while maintaining high rice productivity. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

Ascreen of 2686 compounds derived from marine organisms identified molecules that could synergisewith polymyxin B (PMB) to inhibit the growth of B. cenocepacia. At 1 ?g/mL, five compounds syner-gised with PMB and inhibited the growth of B. cenocepacia by ?70% compared with growth in PMBalone. Follow-up testing revealed that one compound from the screen, the aminocoumarin antibioticnovobiocin, synergised with PMB and colistin against tobramycin-resistant clinical isolates of B. ceno-cepacia and Burkholderia multivorans. In parallel, we show that novobiocin sensitivity is common among BCC species and that these bacteria are even more susceptible to an alternative aminocoumarin, cloro-biocin, which also had an additive effect with PMB against B. cenocepacia.

A series of diarylsulforiamides containing an indole scaffold was also found to have antimitotic properties, but, their mode of interactions with tubulin has remained unidentified so far. In this study: we demonstrate that these sulfonamide drugs bind to the colchicine site of tubulin in a reversible manner. They quenched intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of tubulin presumably due to drug-induced conformational changes in the protein, but were unable to modulate GTPase activity of tubulin in contrast to colchicine that enhances the same enzymatic activity. Further investigation using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed that 5 (N-(5-chloro-7-indolyl)-4-methoxybenzenesulfonamide) afforded a large positive value of heat capacity change (DeltaC(p) = +264, cal mol(-1) K-1) on binding to tubulin, suggesting a substantial conformational transition in the protein along with partial enthalpy- entropy compensation. On the other hand. the 2-chloro regioisomer 2 gave a large negative value of DeltaC(p) (-589 cal mol(-1) K-1) along with complete enthalpyentropy compensation. This thermodynamic profile was thought to be attributable to a prominent contribution of van der Waals interaction and hydrogen bonding between Specific groups in the drug-tubulin complex. These results indicate that a mere alteration in the position of a single substituent chlorine on the indole scaffold has a great influence on the drug-tublin binding thermodynamics.", "label": 0}

Etching temperature and the structure and composition of carbides allow tuning the porosity of CDC. The CDC chlorine content depends on the synthesis temperature, pore size, and metal carbide used during preparation. It was observed that chlorine-loaded CDC killed up to 100% of exposed E. coli and B. anthracis spores and vegetative cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. CDC containing higher concentrations of chlorine killed bacteria to a greater extent and faster than did CDC containing lesser concentrations of chlorine.

OBJECTIVES: We performed a comprehensive identification of DBPs and disinfectant species in waters from public swimming pools in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that disinfect with either chlorine or bromine and we determined the mutagenicity of the waters to compare with the analytical results. METHODS: We used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to measure trihalomethanes in water, GC with electron capture detection for air, low- and high-resolution GC/MS to comprehensively identify DBPs, photometry to measure disinfectant species (free chlorine, monochloroamine, dichloramine, and trichloramine) in the waters, and an ion chromatography method to measure trichloramine in air. We assessed mutagenicity with the Salmonella mutagenicity assay. RESULTS: We identified > 100 DBPs, including many nitrogen-containing DBPs that were likely formed from nitrogen-containing precursors from human inputs, such as urine, sweat, and skin cells. Many DBPs were new and have not been reported previously in either swimming pool or drinking waters. Bromoform levels were greater in brominated than in chlorinated pool waters, but we also identified many brominated DBPs in the chlorinated waters. The pool waters were mutagenic at levels similar to that of drinking water (approximately 1,200 revertants/L-equivalents in strain TA100-S9 mix). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified many new DBPs not identified previously in swimming pool or drinking water and found that swimming pool waters are as mutagenic as typical drinking waters.", "label": 0}

Irradiation has been shown to inactivate leaf-internalized bacteria, but many aspects of targeting these protected pathogens remain unknown. Bacterial cells of a cocktail mixture of 3 isolates of Escherichia coli O157:H7 were drawn into the leaves of iceberg, Boston, green leaf, and red leaf lettuce using vacuum perfusion. The inoculated leaves were treated with a 3-min wash with sodium hypochlorite solution (0, 300, or 600 ppm) or various doses of ionizing radiation (0.25 to 1.5 kGy). Leaves were stomached to recover the internalized cells and survivors enumerated. Washes with 0 ppm (water), 300 ppm, and 600 ppm chlorine solutions each gave reductions of less than 1 log. These reductions were statistically significant only in the case of green leaf lettuce. In contrast, irradiation effectively reduced E. coli O157:H7 on all varieties examined, with all doses tested being significantly reduced from the untreated control. The specific variety influenced the efficacy of irradiation. The greatest reduction obtained was 5 logs on iceberg lettuce treated with 1.5 kGy. The D(10) values (the dose necessary to achieve a 1 log reduction) were significantly (P < 0.05) different among the varieties of lettuce tested, and ranged from 0.30 kGy (iceberg) to 0.45 kGy (Boston). These values were observed to be notably higher than previous irradiation D(10) values for E. coli O157:H7 surface inoculated onto these 4 lettuce varieties. This study has shown that irradiation is able to effectively reduce viable E. coli O157:H7 cells internalized in lettuce, and that the variety of lettuce influences the specific response.", "label": 1}

In order to achieve the highest viral recoveries, filtration methods require the identification of optimal concentration conditions that are unique for each virus type. This study evaluated the effectiveness of 1MDS and NanoCeram filters in recovering adenovirus (AdV) 40 and 41 from tap water, and optimized two secondary concentration procedures the celite and organic flocculation method. Adjustments in pH were made to both virus elution solutions and sample matrices to determine which resulted in higher virus recovery. Samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Most Probable Number (MPN) techniques and AdV recoveries were determined by comparing levels of virus in sample concentrates to that in the initial input. The recovery of adenovirus was highest for samples in unconditioned tap water (pH 8) using the 1MDS filter and celite for secondary concentration. Elution buffer containing 0.1% sodium polyphosphate at pH 10.0 was determined to be most effective overall for both AdV types. Under these conditions, the average recovery for AdV40 and 41 was 49% and 60%, respectively. By optimizing secondary elution steps, AdV recovery from tap water could be improved at least two-fold compared to the currently used methodology. Identification of the optimal concentration conditions for human AdV (HAdV) is important for timely and sensitive detection of these viruses from both surface and drinking waters.", "label": 0}

Evidence from studies in processing plants shows that the factors associated with the presence of L. monocytogenes are those that favor growth. Interestingly, most conditions promoting bacterial growth were shown, in laboratory assays, to decrease adhesion of L. monocytogenes cells. Good growth conditions can be found in so-called harborage sites, i.e. shelters due to unhygienic design of equipment and premises or unhygienic or damaged materials. These sites are hard to eliminate. A conceptual model of persistence/no persistence based on the relative weight of growth vs. outcome of cleaning and disinfection is suggested. It shows that a minimum initial bacterial load is necessary for bacteria to persist in a harborage site and that when a low initial bacterial charge is applied, early cleaning and disinfection is the only way to avoid persistence. We conclude by proposing that there are no strains of L. monocytogenes with unique properties that lead to persistence, but harborage sites in food industry premises and equipment where L. monocytogenes can persist.", "label": 0}

SWP water was passed through this unit under various conditions and the bromide removal was measured as well as the formation potential for various org. by products. This study shows up to 35% of the bromide was removed and there were up to 60% less disinfection byproducts measured. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}
{"id": "9511", "title": "Chlorination and ozonation in water and wastewater treatment", "abstract": "In comparison with ozone, chlorine shows a number of distinct advantages. Chlorination of potable water results in residual disinfecting capability, protecting supplies from recontamination in the distribution system. Chlorination is practiced at a much lower cost than ozonation, and is much more flexible in adjusting to flow rate and water quality variations, which is due mainly to the ease of process monitoring since satisfactory techniques for chlorine analysis exist. It is known that chlorine can react with certain organics to produce products that are known to be toxic or potentially carcinogenic to humans. The concentrations of such products has usually been assumed to be below levels requiring concern, or at levels presenting less of a health threat than posed by alternative practices. Evidence has not been provided to disprove this belief, although research must continue. The position of chlorination in wastewater treatment is far less secure. Sufficient evidence has accumulated to show that chlorinated effluent has a negative effect on the receiving water. Tests have shown that a final dechlorination step will eliminate measurable effects. However dechlorination is not likely to alter the net production of chlorinated organics. Since much larger quantities of organic precursors are present in wastewater, the problem of their production is far greater than with water treatment. Therefore, dechlorination cannot be given full approval as an acceptable solution until more is known about chlorinated organics production and their implications. Cost considerations might also point towards a different means of treatment, as chlorination dechlorination is relatively expensive. Disinfection of potable water is the largest water related application of ozone. With a higher oxidation potential than chlorine, ozone also shows improved taste and odor and colour destruction. However, ozonation of potable water supplies appears to be inferior in light of current chlorination capability and flexibility. While ozone is a rapid and effective disinfectant, it is both short lived and expensive. The benefit of maintaining residual disinfecting capability has been demonstrated, and is a highly recommended practice. Where postchlorination is required to counteract this deficiency of ozonation the cost of treatment is further escalated, with no demonstrable improvement over chlorination. Therefore, unless current chlorination practice is demonstrated to be harmful to human health, little increased demand for ozonation of potable water supplies is likely.

Although this is generally achieved, the incidence of waterborne outbreaks associated with potable water has been increasing over the last decade. Infection from pathogens such as Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Cryptosporidium and Giardia and viral infections are on the increase, with the protozoans presenting their own particular problems due to chlorine resistance. Biofilm bacteria are generally more resistant to biocides than planktonic microorganisms. Thus, the water industry is presented with a problem, particularly with pathogens that enter the water system and become incorporated into biofilms. The presence of biofilms in potable water systems is discussed in terms of their development, structure, function and quantification on surfaces. Survival of specific water-borne microbial pathogens is discussed in relation to their mode of growth in biofilms. Factors that influence growth such as nutrient availability, surface roughness and substrate composition are also reviewed.", "label": 1}

We studied the presence of total and fecal coliforms, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, Giardia and Cryptosporidium in the manure of all of these production systems. The concentrations of the studied zoonotic pathogens did not differ between the conventional and the litter systems investigated. The source separation system yielded separated solid and liquid fractions. Total and fecal coliforms, C. perfringens, Enterococcus, E. coli, and Y. enterocolitica were found in the solids and the liquid fractions of a source separation system. Campylobacter species were not detected in the liquid fractions.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a brief exposure to turbulent gas-liquid mixing conditions in a static mixer on inactivation of C parvum oocysts by ozone. Inactivation measured in an ozone contacting apparatus that employed a static mixer for ozone dissolution was compared to predictions based on a previously published kinetic model of C parvum inactivation by dissolved ozone in gently stirred batch reactors. Although initial contact in the static mixer had no immediate effect on the oocysts, a 20% increase in the rate of inactivation during subsequent contact with dissolved ozone was observed. Increasing the degree of turbulence within the static mixer did not yield additional inactivation. Use of static mixers for dissolution of ozone in drinking water treatment systems may provide limited enhancement of C parvum inactivation by dissolved ozone. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Many conventional sterilisation methods are not suitable for the next generation of biomaterials, mainly due to their complex composition, based on nanomaterials, often incorporating bioactive moieties. In this study, we investigate sterilisation efficacy of slow chlorine releasing compound sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate (SDIC) for polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)-poly(caprolactone urea-urethane) (PCL) scaffolds in comparison with conventional sterilisation methods. METHODS: POSS-PCL scaffolds were subjected to 70% ethanol, UV, and SDIC sterilisation methods. Samples were immersed in tryptone soya broth (TSB) and thioglycollate medium (THY) and after seven days visually inspected for signs of microbial growth. Bulk and surface properties and molecular weight distribution profiles of the scaffolds after sterilization were investigated using FTIR analysis, surface hydrophilicity, scanning electron microscopy analysis, tensile strength testing, and gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) were seeded on the scaffolds and AlamarBlue(R) viability assay was performed to investigate cell metabolic activity. Confocal imaging of rhodamine phalloidin and Dapi stained ADSC on scaffolds was used to demonstrate cell morphology. RESULTS: GPC results showed that autoclaving led to a significant decrease in the molecular weight of POSS-PCL, whereas ethanol caused visible deformation of the polymer 3D structure and UV radiation did not effectively sterilise the scaffolds. AlamarBlue(R) analysis showed metabolic activity close to that of tissue culture plastic for ethanol and SDIC. CONCLUSION: SDIC sterilisation can be safely applied to biodegradable scaffolds unsuitable for the more common sterilisation methods.", "label": 0}

An aqueous, biological metal-cleaning process operating under mild conditions (pH 9, 42 degrees C) eliminates the use of environmentally unfriendly cleaning materials such as chlorinated solvents by employing microorganisms to degrade greases and oils naturally. This process was characterized in terms of initial degradation rates of a representative metal lubricant and by phylogenetic identification of the active bacteria. The metal lubricant in a surfactant solution was degraded by a bacterial consortium, and its concentration was determined by a novel gas chromatography assay. The maximum degradation rate Vmax and the apparent Km were obtained as 45 mg/(day mg protein) and 24 g/l on cellular basis, and 4.6 g/(day l) and 33 g/l on a volumetric basis, respectively. Mineralization of the metal lubricant was shown by analyzing the evolved CO2 and Cl-, and the bacterial consortium utilized the metal lubricant as a sole carbon and energy source (micro=0.05+/-0.01 h(-1) at 0.5 vol% lubricant concentration). The active bacteria in the biological metal-cleaning process were identified as Bacillus licheniformis for the higher lubricant concentrations (3, 5, and 7.5 vol%), Bacillus cereus at 1 vol%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rhizobiaceae strain M100, and Achromobacter sp.

Lettuce seeds were inoculated at a high level with two Salmonella enterica and two Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains each (+/- 8 log(10) CFU/g seed) and the survival of the pathogens was monitored over two years using standard plating techniques on selective medium. The Salmonella strains (serovars Typhimurium and Thompson) survived significantly better on the seeds than the E. coli O157:H7 strains (MB3885 and NCTC12900). When individual seeds were tested two years after inoculation, Salmonella was recovered from each individual seed, whereas E. coli O157:H7 only from 4% to 14% of the seeds, depending on the recovery method. When contaminated stored seeds were germinated and the seedlings examined for presence of the pathogens, it was clear that both pathogens were able to proliferate on the seedlings. Pathogen counts up to 5.92 log(10) CFU and 4.41 log(10) CFU per positive seedling were observed for Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7, respectively. Our study not only confirms the long-term survival of enteric pathogens on seeds but also shows that the pathogens maintain their ability to resuscitate and proliferate on the seedlings.

The metabolically heterogeneous cells within colony biofilm were physically fractionated and the oxidative stress generated in each fraction was monitored by soxS and oxyS promoter reporter systems. Chlorine induced soxS to a greater degree in the dormant cells than active cells of biofilm. In addition, chlorine-dependent induction of soxS was more prominent in aerobically grown cells compared with anaerobically grown cells. On the contrary, the soxS induction by other chemicals such as paraquat and silver, and the oxyS induction by hydrogen peroxide were higher in active biofilm cells and aerobically grown cells. Our results suggest that chlorine might generate strong oxidative stress by direct modification of the 2Fe-2S cluster in an O(2)-independent manner, which provides the molecular basis of our previous report showing that chlorine has a more efficient killing effect on dormant cells in biofilm and cells grown under unaerobic conditions. This study shows that chlorine may be particularly promising for the control of anaerobic bacteria and biofilm where dormant cells are hard to control.", "label": 1}

Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Montevideo, poliovirus 1, and the bacteriophages PRD1, phiX174, and MS2 were used as model and surrogate organisms. Chemicals readily available to producers and/or consumers were evaluated as antimicrobial additives for the production of washes. The gentle agitation of contaminated strawberries in water for 2 min led to reductions in microbial populations ranging from 41 to 79% and from 62 to 90% at water temperatures of 22 and 43 degrees C, respectively. Significant reductions (> 98%) in numbers of bacteria and viruses were obtained with sodium hypochlorite (50 to 300 ppm of free chlorine), Oxine or Carnebon (200 ppm of product generating \"stabilized chlorine dioxide\"), Tsunami (100 ppm of peroxyacetic acid), and Alcide (100 or 200 ppm of acidified sodium chlorite) washes. Overall, 200 ppm of acidified sodium chlorite produced the greatest reductions of microorganisms. Hydrogen peroxide (0.5%) was slightly less effective than free chlorine in a strawberry wash and caused slight fruit discoloration. Cetylpyridinium chloride (0.1%) was effective in the reduction of bacterial species, while trisodium phosphate (1%) was effective against viruses. The consumer-oriented produce wash Fit was very effective (> 99%) in reducing the numbers of bacteria but not in reducing the numbers of viruses. Another wash, Healthy Harvest, was significantly less effective than Fit in reducing bacterial pathogens but more effective for viruses. The performance of automatic dishwashing detergent was similar to that of Healthy Harvest and significantly better than that of liquid dishwashing detergent. Solutions containing table salt (2% NaCl) or vinegar (10%) reduced the numbers of bacteria by about 90%, whereas only the vinegar wash reduced the numbers of viruses significantly (ca. 95%).", "label": 1}

This system uses chlorine dioxide as its only disinfectant. The manufacturer claims the system provides safe sterilisation of nasendoscopes. However, there appear to be no reports in the literature to date that evaluate the efficacy of this system in a clinical setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 'in use' efficacy of Tristel wipes in decontaminating nasendoscopes and to identify any significant contamination between cleaning and usage. METHODS: A total of 31 cleaning episodes were performed. Each cleaning episode included two swabs after cleaning the scopes, one from the tip and the other from the handle. Another two swabs from the same areas were also taken before application to the patient. The microbiology unit evaluated all swabs for bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial growth. RESULTS: Overall, 123 swabs from 31 cleaning episodes were tested. None of the swabs taken from the tips (n=31) or handles (n=31) after cleaning with Tristel wipes developed any organism growth. Furthermore, none of the swabs taken from the tip of the scopes before using on patients (n=31) developed any growth. Of the 31 swabs taken from the handle before use, 3 developed significant staphylococcal growth. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the 'in use' efficacy of Tristel wipes in cleaning the scopes of bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria was 100%. Attention to hand hygiene and the use of gloves should be considered when handling the cleaned scopes to minimise the risk of contamination between cleaning and application to patients.", "label": 0}

Samples were treated with intermittent VI with 21.3 kPa and compared with dipping washing in 2% malic acid. The initial sample pathogen levels were approximately 10(5)-10(7) CFU/cm(2). Enumerations of the three pathogens on paprika and carrots treated with VI washing were reduced to below the detection limit (= 1 logo CFU/cm(2)) after 3-5 min and 15 20 min, respectively. For each time point where populations of the three pathogens were reduced to below the detection limit by VI treatment, populations of 1.2-1.9 log CFU/cm(2) and 2.5 to 2.8 log CFU/cm(2) survived on paprika and carrots, respectively, when subjected to dipping treatment. After 20 min of dipping treatment, surviving populations of the three pathogens ranged from 3.5 to 4.1 and 33 to 4.4 log CFU/cm(2) on king oyster mushrooms and muskmelons, respectively. After 20 min of VI treatment, surviving populations of the three pathogens ranged from 3.0 to 3.6 log and 3.1 to 4.1 log CFU/cm(2), respectively, on king oyster mushrooms and muskmelons. Additionally, there were no significant (P >= 0.05) differences in pathogen reductions between dipping and VI treatment for both king oyster mushrooms and muskmelons.

Amine groups were attached to the aromatic ring of PES through nitration and reduction reactions and acetylation of the amine groups was accomplished using acetic anhydride. The amine-modified polymers were analyzed with H-1 NMR and FTIR spectroscopy, to reveal that one -NH2 group was attached on each aromatic ring. Solutions of the polymers in DMF were coagulated in water to yield ultrafiltration membranes with a microporous skin and a macroporous support with macrovoids. The pure water permeances of the PES/PES-NH2 (amine-modified PES) and PES/PES-NHAc (amide modified PES) membranes made from solutions containing 10% unmodified PES and 6% modified PES were in between the PES membranes made from 10% to 16% PES solutions. This was attributed partly to the increased hydrophilicity due to the addition of modified PES and leaching of part of the modified PES during membrane preparation, which was verified through elemental analysis of the polymers and the membranes. The amine and amide groups on the membranes were chlorinated in hypochlorous acid solution to yield the antimicrobial N-halamines, which could be repeatedly applied after chlorine release by the membranes. Through iodometric titrations, it was found that the PES/PES-NHAc membranes could be chlorinated more than the PES/PES-NH2 membranes and remained chlorinated for a longer time upon exposure to flowing water.

Lettuce leaf pieces (5 by 5 cm) were inoculated with a five-strain mixture of green fluorescent protein-labeled E. coli O157:H7 at 5.6 log CFU per piece. One inoculated lettuce piece was added to five uninoculated leaves during washing. Peroxyacetic acid and mixed peracid were tested at 10, 20, and 30 ppm, and chlorine was tested at 30 and 50 ppm. No organic load (liquefied lettuce leaves) and 10% organic load in processing water were compared. Without organic load, peroxyacetic acid at 30 ppm, mixed peracid at 10, 20, and 30 ppm, and chlorine at 30 and 50 ppm all significantly reduced E. coli O157: H7 in processing water by 1.83, 1.73, 1.50, 1.83, 1.34, and 1.83 log CFU/ml, respectively, compared with washing with water alone.

A 10% organic load in the processing water reduced efficacy of antimicrobial agents. In this contaminated water, peroxyacetic acid at 10 and 20 ppm and chlorine at 30 ppm produced effects not significantly different from those of water alone. Therefore, it is important to understand the impact of organic load when validating the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatments.", "label": 1}

It was found that sulfadiazine and ciprofloxacin greatly promoted the occurrence of opportunistic pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium avium and its broader genus Mycobacterium spp., as well as the amoebae Acanthamoeba spp. and Hartmanella vermiformis, in bulk water of DWDSs. Moreover, sulfadiazine and ciprofloxacin exhibited much stronger combined effects on the increase of these opportunistic pathogens. Based on the analysis of the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), it was verified that EPS production was increased by the antibiotic resistant bacteria arising from the effects of sulfadiazine/ciprofloxacin. The combined effects of sulfadiazine and ciprofloxacin induced the greatest increase of EPS production in DWDSs. Furthermore, the increased EPS with higher contents of proteins and secondary structure beta-sheet led to greater bacterial aggregation and adsorption. Meanwhile, large numbers of suspended particles were formed, increasing the chlorine-resistance capability, which was responsible for the enhancement of the particle-associated opportunistic pathogens in bulk water of DWDSs with sulfadiazine/ciprofloxacin.

The experimental treatments included N rates at three levels (0, 50, and 100kgha(-1)), Zn rates at three levels (0, 5, and 10kgha(-1)), and saline water at two levels (8 and 16 dS m(-1) as saline and ultra-saline water). According to the results, N and Zn application had a significant effect on the plant height, pod number per plant, and seed yield. However, the value of these traits decreased as a result of the higher salinity level (from 8 to 16 dS m(-1)). From the results, the glucosinolate content was not affected by N or Zn fertilization, whereas, salinity increased the glucosinolate content from 27.51% to 30.06% when saline water and ultra-saline water were applied, respectively. In addition, the effect of ultra-saline water on the decrease in the N, phosphorous, potassium, and calcium uptake and the increase in the sodium and chlorine accumulation in canola seed was significant. However, Zn application could diminish adverse effects of salinity on phosphorus uptake. For instance, under ultra-saline water conditions, application of 10kgha(-1) Zn increased the seed phosphorus content compared with control treatment. In general, it seems that nutrients' supply, especially N and Zn, can be considered as an effective solution to diminish adverse effects of salinity.", "label": 0}

Analysis of cellular fatty acids indicate that the bacterium is most closely related to Hydrogenophaga taeniospiralis. Resting cells incubated with 10 ppm of Aroclor 1221 at 5 or 30\u00b0C for 48 h removed all mono-, most di-, and several trichlorobiphenyls. At 5\u00b0C, removal of MCBs (monochlorobiphenyls) was between 63 to 89%, DCBs (dichlorobiphenyls) was between 30 to 78%, and TCBs (trichlorobiphenyls) was between 30 to 75%. At 30\u00b0C, removal of MCBs was 100%, DCBs was between 30 to 100%, and TCBs was between 27 to 59%. Congeners with two or more ortho chlorine were generally resistant to degradation. However, removal of di-ortho plus para-substituted congeners at 30\u00b0C and not at 5\u00b0C, suggest that the presence of a para-chlorine enhanced the cometabolism of these congeners at 30\u00b0C. Furthermore, after 72 h, resting cells removed 68 and 83% of 500 ?M of 2,4?-dichlorobiphenyl (2,4?-DCB) and, 35 and 44% of 500 ?M of 2,3-dichlorobiphenyl (2,3-DCB) at 5 and 30\u00b0C, respectively.

Sewage treatment plants based on active sludges seem to be not very efficient in its complete removal from effluents while additional disinfection treatments by chlorination are able to do it. In a simulation of the chlorination step herein we report that caffeine is transformed in six by-products: 8-chlorocaffeine, 1,3-dimethyl-5-azabarbituric acid, N,N'-dimethylparabanic acid, N,N'-dimethyloxalamide, N-methylurea and N,N'-dimethylurea. The ecotoxicity of caffeine and identified compounds was evaluated on the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata to assess acute and chronic toxicity, while SOS Chromotest and Ames Test were used to detect the genotoxic potential of the investigated compounds. Moreover, we assessed the possible antigenotoxic effect of the selected compounds using SOS Chromotest after co-incubation with the standard genotoxin, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide. Chronic exposure to these compounds caused inhibition of growth population on the rotifer while the algae seemed to be unaffected.

Of the topical ophthalmic antibiotics used to treat acute bacterial conjunctivitis, fluoroquinolones are especially useful because they possess a broad antibacterial spectrum, are bactericidal in action, are generally well tolerated, and have been less prone to development of bacterial resistance. Besifloxacin, the latest advanced fluoroquinolone approved for treating bacterial conjunctivitis, is the first fluoroquinolone developed specifically for topical ophthalmic use. It has a C-8 chlorine substituent and is known as a chloro-fluoroquinolone. Besifloxacin possesses relatively balanced dual-targeting activity against bacterial topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase (topoisomerse II), two essential enzymes involved in bacterial DNA replication, leading to increased potency and decreased likelihood of bacterial resistance developing to besifloxacin. Microbiological data suggest a relatively high potency and rapid bactericidal activity for besifloxacin against common ocular pathogens, including bacteria resistant to other fluoroquinolones, especially resistant staphylococcal species. Randomized, double-masked, controlled clinical studies demonstrated the clinical efficacy of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% administered three-times daily for 5 days to be superior to the vehicle alone and similar to moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% for bacterial conjunctivitis. In addition, besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% administered two-times daily for 3 days was clinically more effective than the vehicle alone for bacterial conjunctivitis. Besifloxacin has also been shown in preclinical animal studies to be potentially effective for the \"off-label\" treatment of infections following ocular surgery, prophylaxis of endophthalmitis, and the treatment of bacterial keratitis. Taken together, clinical and preclinical animal studies indicate that besifloxacin is an important new option for the treatment of ocular infections.", "label": 0}

The purpose of this research was to develop a predictive model for the probability of C. jejuni and S. Typhimurium contamination on chicken carcasses during chilling. Each experiment was conducted using 36 chicken drumsticks, 6 for control and 30 for treatment. A percentage of treatment drumsticks were inoculated with C. jejuni or S. Typhimurium. Inoculated and non-inoculated drumsticks were mixed together and treated in a chiller simulator under simulated chilling conditions. The post-chill contamination (positive/negative) was determined for each drumstick. A probability model, P = 1/[1 + exp(-y)], was developed based on the data, where P is the probability of an individual chicken drumstick being contaminated after chilling, and y is a linear function of treatment factors, pre-chill incidence (%), total chlorine level in chill water (ppm), and the age of chill water (h). The Hosmer and Lemeshow statistics indicated a good fit between the data and the model. This model can be used to predict post-chill contamination probability based on the pre-chill incidence and the chlorine level, and, conversely, it can be used to define the pre-chill percent contamination and chlorination requirement for controlling post-chill contamination.", "label": 1}
{"id": "3858", "title": "Structure and Functional Characteristics of Bacterial Biofilms in Fluid Processing Operations", "abstract": "Bacterial biofilms create a number of serious problems for industrial fluid processing operations. Mechanical blockages, impedance of heat transfer processes, and biodeterioration of the components of metallic and polymeric systems result in billions of dollars in losses each year. Product spoilage and possible risks to public health are also consequences of biofilm-mediated contamination. Fundamentally, these biofouling activities can be described in terms of the physicochemical properties that are associated with bacterial metabolism and biofilm development. Treatment of biofouling is also complicated by the unique structural attributes of biofilms: extracellular polymeric substances create diffusional barriers to antimicrobial agents, protecting labile cellular targets from both oxidizing and nonoxidizing compounds. The mechanisms associated with the initial events of bacterial adhesion to engineered surfaces and subsequent fouling of biofilm formation are poorly understood. However, studies of bacterial biofilm architecture have been greatly facilitated by the application of confocal laser microscopy, scanning or transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This paper reviews the genesis of biofilm formation and describes the influence of structure on biofouling activities in industrial fluid handling systems.", "label": 1}

Results from operational tests showed that the volume of permeate produced in the combination of periodic relaxation with flushing and chlorine dosage procedures was 49% higher than the volume obtained when these procedures were not used. Two years of continuous operation demonstrated that the ultrafiltration pilot plant performed better during fall and winter seasons, higher permeate flow production and reduced chemical cleanings frequency. Observed behavior seems to be associated with the algae bloom events in the reservoir, which are more frequent during spring and summer seasons, confirmed by chlorophyll-a analysis results. Concentrate clarification using ferric chloride was quite effective in removing NOM and turbidity, allowing its recirculation to the ultrafiltration feed tank. This procedure made it possible to reach almost 99% water recovery considering a single 54-hour recirculation cycle. Water quality monitoring demonstrated that the ultrafiltration pilot plant was quite efficient, and that potential pathogenic organisms, Escherichia coli and total coliforms, turbidity and apparent color removals were 100%, 95.1%, and 91.5%, respectively.

Biofilms are traditionally associated with wet or damp surfaces such as indwelling medical devices and tubing on medical equipment. However, microbes can survive for extended periods in a desiccated state on dry hospital surfaces, and biofilms have recently been discovered on dry hospital surfaces. Microbes attached to surfaces and in biofilms are less susceptible to biocides, antibiotics and physical stress. Thus, surface attachment and/or biofilm formation may explain how vegetative bacteria can survive on surfaces for weeks to months (or more), interfere with attempts to recover microbes through environmental sampling, and provide a mixed bacterial population for the horizontal transfer of resistance genes. The capacity of existing detergent formulations and disinfectants to disrupt biofilms may have an important and previously unrecognized role in determining their effectiveness in the field, which should be reflected in testing standards. There is a need for further research to elucidate the nature and physiology of microbes on dry hospital surfaces, specifically the prevalence and composition of biofilms. This will inform new approaches to hospital cleaning and disinfection, including novel surfaces that reduce microbial attachment and improve microbial detachment, and methods to augment the activity of biocides against surface-attached microbes such as bacteriophages and antimicrobial peptides. Future strategies to address environmental contamination on hospital surfaces should consider the presence of microbes attached to surfaces, including biofilms.", "label": 1}

The data set includes 84 carcinogens, 77 noncarcinogens, and 7 research chemicals. Carcinogens included 49 mutagens and 35 nonmutagens; noncarcinogens included 24 mutagens and 53 nonmutagens. The transformation assay did not use an exogenous activation system, thus, all chemical responses depended on the inherent target cell metabolic capacity where metabolic activation was required. The upper dose limit was 100 milli-osmolar because the assay could not discriminate active and inactive chemicals tested above this concentration. Certain physicochemical properties resulted in technical problems that affected chemical biological activity. For example, chemicals that reacted with plastic were usually nonmutagenic carcinogens. Similarly, chemicals that were insoluble in medium, or bound metals, were usually nonmutagenic and nontransforming. Multifactorial data analyses revealed that the transformation assay discriminated between nonmutagenic carcinogens and noncarcinogens; it detected 64% of the carcinogens and only 26% of the noncarcinogens. In contrast, the transformation assay detected most mutagenic chemicals, including 94% of the mutagenic carcinogens and 70% of the mutagenic noncarcinogens. Thus, transformation or Salmonella typuimurium mutagenicity assays could not discriminate mutagenic carcinogens from mutagenic noncarcinogens. Data analyses also revealed that mutagenic chemicals were more cytotoxic than nonmutagenic chemicals; 88% of the mutagens had an LD50 < 5 mM, whereas half of the nonmutagens had an LD50 > 5 mM. Binary data analyses of the same data set revealed that the transformation assay and rodent bioassay had a concordance of 71%, a sensitivity for carcinogens of 80.0%, and a specificity for detecting noncarcinogens of 60%. In contrast, Salmonella mutagenicity assays and rodent bioassays had a concordance of 63%, a sensitivity of 58%, and a specificity of 69%. The transformation assay complemented the Salmonella mutagenesis assay in the identification of nonmutagenic carcinogens; thus, the two assays had a combined 83% sensitivity for all carcinogens and a 75% specificity for nonmutagenic noncarcinogens.

Numerous community water treatment facilities are experiencing difficulty in meeting current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards, and it is likely that the permissible levels may be lowered in the future.

It was found to be effective with the order of ease of degradation of the saxitoxins being GTX5 (B1) approximately dcSTX > STX > GTX3 approximately C2 > C1 > GTX2. However the effectiveness of chlorine was pH dependent. Degradation as a function of pH was not linear with the degree of degradation increasing rapidly at around pH 7.5. At pH 9 > 90% removal was possible provided a residual of 0.5 mg l(-1) free chlorine was present after 30 min contact time. The more effective degradation at higher pH was unexpected as chlorine is known to be a weaker oxidant under these conditions. The more effective degradation, then, must be due to the toxins, which are ionisable molecules, being present in a form at higher pH which is more susceptible to oxidation. The feasibility of using chlorine to remove saxitoxins during water treatment will therefore depend strongly on the pH of the water being chlorinated. Degradation may be improved by pH adjustment but may not be a practical solution. Although saxitoxins were degraded in that the parent compounds were not detected by chemical analysis, there is no indication as to the nature of the degradation products. However, acute toxicity as determined by the mouse bioassay was eliminated.", "label": 1}

An algorithm for a chlorine feed-forward dosing scheme to maintain a stable chlorine level was further developed and validated. Organic loads with chemical oxygen demand of 300 to 800 mg/liter were modeled using iceberg lettuce. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) was added to the simulated wash solution incrementally. The solution pH, free and total chlorine, and oxidation-reduction potential were monitored, and chlorination breakpoint and chloramine humps determined. The results indicated that the E. coli O157:H7 inactivation curve mirrored that of the free chlorine during the chlorine replenishment process: a slight reduction in E. coli O157:H7 was observed as the combined chlorine hump was approached, while the E. coli O157:H7 cell populations declined sharply after chlorination passed the chlorine hump and decreased to below the detection limit (<0.75 most probable number per ml) after the chlorination breakpoint was reached. While the amounts of NaOCl required for reaching the chloramine humps and chlorination breakpoints depended on the organic loads, there was a linear correlation between NaOCl input and free chlorine in the wash solution once NaOCl dosing passed the chlorination breakpoint, regardless of organic load. The data obtained were further exploited to develop a NaOCl dosing algorithm for maintaining a stable chlorine concentration in the presence of an increasing organic load. The validation tests results indicated that free chlorine could be maintained at target levels using such an algorithm, while the pH and oxidation-reduction potential were also stably maintained using this system.", "label": 1}

Alfalfa seeds were inoculated with S. enterica and E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated from alfalfa seeds or other environmental sources and sprouted to examine growth of these human pathogens in association with sprouting seeds. S. enterica strains grew an average of 3.7 log(10) on sprouting seeds over 2 days, while E. coli O15707 strains grew significantly less, an average of 2.3 log(10).

{"id": "1790", "title": "Life on the outside: role of biofilms in environmental persistence of Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli", "abstract": "Escherichia coli is a heterogeneous species that can be part of the normal flora of humans but also include strains of medical importance. Among pathogenic members, Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC) are some of the more prominent pathogenic E. coli within the public sphere. STEC disease outbreaks are typically associated with contaminated beef, contaminated drinking water, and contaminated fresh produce. These water- and food-borne pathogens usually colonize cattle asymptomatically; cows will shed STEC in their feces and the subsequent fecal contamination of the environment and processing plants is a major concern for food and public safety. This is especially important because STEC can survive for prolonged periods of time outside its host in environments such as water, produce, and farm soil. Biofilms are hypothesized to be important for survival in the environment especially on produce, in rivers, and in processing plants. Several factors involved in biofilm formation such as curli, cellulose, poly-N-acetyl glucosamine, and colanic acid are involved in plant colonization and adherence to different surfaces often found in meat processing plants. In food processing plants, contamination of beef carcasses occurs at different stages of processing and this is often caused by the formation of STEC biofilms on the surface of several pieces of equipment associated with slaughtering and processing. Biofilms protect bacteria against several challenges, including biocides used in industrial processes. STEC biofilms are less sensitive than planktonic cells to several chemical sanitizers such as quaternary ammonium compounds, peroxyacetic acid, and chlorine compounds. Increased resistance to sanitizers by STEC growing in a biofilm is likely to be a source of contamination in the processing plant. This review focuses on the role of biofilm formation by STEC as a means of persistence outside their animal host and factors associated with biofilm formation.", "label": 1}

However, use of 14C-labeling posed again known analytical problems, especially in TCA extraction from the sample matrix. Therefore--after evaluation of available methods--a new procedure using decarboxylation of [1,2-14C]TCA combined with extraction of the resultant 14C-chloroform with a non-polar solvent and its subsequent radiometric measurement was developed. The method solves previous difficulties and permits an easy determination of amounts between 0.4 and 20 kBq (10 - 500 ng g(-1)) of carrier-less [1,2-14C]TCA in samples from environmental investigations. The procedure is, however, not suitable for direct [36Cl]TCA determination in chlorination studies with 36Cl. Because TCA might be microbially degraded in soil during extraction and sample storage and its extraction from soil or needles is never complete, the decarboxylation method--i.e. 2 h TCA decomposition to chloroform and CO2 in aqueous solution or suspension in closed vial at 90 degrees C and pH 4.6 with subsequent CHCl3 extraction-is recommended here, estimated V < 7%. Moreover, the influence of pH and temperature on the decarboxylation of TCA in aqueous solution was studied in a broad range and its environmental relevance is shown in the case of TCA decarboxylation in spruce needles which takes place also at ambient temperatures and might amount more than 10-20% after a growing season. A study of TCA distribution in spruce needles after below-ground uptake shows the highest uptake rate into current needles which have, however, a lower TCA content than older needle-year classes, TCA biodegradation in forest soil leads predominatingly to CO2.", "label": 0}
{"id": "9462", "title": "Foodborne viruses1", "abstract": "Foodborne and waterborne viral infections are increasingly recognized as causes of illness in humans. This increase is partly explained by changes in food processing and consumption patterns that lead to the worldwide availability of high-risk food. As a result, vast outbreaks may occur due to contamination of food by a single foodhandler or at a single source. Although there are numerous fecal\u2013orally transmitted viruses, most reports of foodborne transmission describe infections with Norwalk-like caliciviruses (NLV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), suggesting that these viruses are associated with the greatest risk of foodborne transmission. NLV and HAV can be transmitted from person to person, or indirectly via food, water, or fomites contaminated with virus-containing feces or vomit. People can be infected without showing symptoms. The high frequency of secondary cases of NLV illness and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 of hepatitis A following a foodborne outbreak results in amplification of the problem. The burden of illness is highest in the elderly, and therefore is likely to increase due to the aging population. For HAV, the burden of illness may increase following hygienic control measures, due to a decreasing population of naturally immune individuals and a concurrent increase in the population at risk. Recent advances in the research of NLV and HAV have led to the development of molecular methods which can be used for molecular tracing of virus strains. These methods can be and have been used for the detection of common source outbreaks. While traditionally certain foods have been implicated in virus outbreaks, it is clear that almost any food item can be involved, provided it has been handled by an infected person. There are no established methods for detection of viruses in foods other than shellfish. Little information is available on disinfection and preventive measures specifically for these viruses. Studies addressing this issue are hampered by the lack of culture systems. As currently available routine monitoring systems exclusively focus on bacterial pathogens, efforts should be made to combine epidemiological and virological information for a combined laboratory-based rapid detection system for foodborne viruses. With better surveillance, including typing information, outbreaks of foodborne infections could be reported faster to prevent further spread.", "label": 1}

The indiscriminate use of chem. antifouling treatments based on toxic biocides to eliminate these biofilms implies the discharge of large amts. of residual biocide in their effluent, which neg. affects the quality of coastal waters. This has led more developed countries to impose ever-stricter legislation to control this matter. Therefore, this paper compares the effectiveness of a flow inversion phys. treatment in eliminating the biofilm formed on the internal tube surface of a heat exchanger with that of a traditional chem. treatment with NaClO at 0.8 ppm. The results indicate that it is possible to eliminate a biofilm formed on the inside surfaces of tubes by use of intermittent doses of chem. treatments at low concns., but once the first four days in which the biocide reacts and eliminates the biofilm have elapsed, the residual biocide in the effluent is very high. The action of the phys. flow inversion treatment is largely evidenced in the redn. of the heat transfer resistance (R f) and not so markedly on the fluid frictional resistance (f). This led us to combine both methods of treatment thus minimizing environmental impact on the marine ecosystem. Scientific relevance of the paper: Biofouling is one of the most serious problems facing numerous industrial processes using seawater as their coolant fluid. Chem. antifouling methods used to mitigate the problem face ever more restrictive legislation regulating water quality. We are hence obliged to seek alternatives that enable said industrial processes comply with current legislation. This paper, therefore, compares a traditional chem. treatment with NaClO and a flow inversion phys. treatment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the latter. We, hence, offer an alternative that is not aggressive on the environment or is a combination of a tried and tested traditional chem. treatment method. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

An ideal condition was then selected, and its applicability was studied on a commercial meat slicer and an industrial hot-dog peeler (using a surrogate organism). L monocytogenes biofilm cells initially showed more sensitivity to ClO2 treatments, as compared to planktonic cells, but after 10 min, similar to 4 log CFU/cm(2) reduction was observed for all the concentrations used.

Contaminated fruits can be regarded as a major source of spoilage caused by A. acidoterrestris in fruit juices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of neutral electrolyzed water (NEW) in reducing the number of A. acidoterrestris spores in aqueous suspension and on surface-inoculated apples. Its effectiveness was compared with that of sodium hypochlorite (SH) solutions at free chlorine concentrations of 50 and 200mg/L. Viable spore counts in test suspensions were significantly (P<0.05) reduced after exposure to NEW (200mg/L free chlorine) for 1 min. However, NEW (50mg/L free chlorine) and SH solutions were unable to significantly (P>0.05) reduce the number of viable spore during the same exposure period. More than 5 log reduction in spore counts was achieved by NEW solution containing 200mg/L free chlorine after 5 min of exposure. Exposure to NEW solutions for 3 min yielded more than 4 log reductions in the number of viable spores on apple surfaces. At the same concentrations of free chlorine, NEW was three to more than ten-fold effective than SH in reducing viability of A. acidoterrestris spores in aqueous suspension and on apple surfaces. This finding suggests that NEW can be considered as an effective disinfectant for the control of A. acidoterrestris on fruits.", "label": 1}

Organic extracts were prepared from the soil samples by Soxhlet extraction. One set of the soil samples was extracted with methylene chloride and a second set with cyclohexane. Two criteria from reproducible dose-related increases in response to the soil were used to compare the positive responses: 1) the concentrations required for doubling responses and 2) a minimum concentration required to produce statistically significant increases from background controls. Analysis of variance indicated that with S9 mix, Ames and SOS results were similar for the same soils and solvent extractions. However, without S9 mix, the SOS test was significantly more sensitive than the Ames test to the genotoxins extracted from the soils.

To date, the most effective procedures for reducing bacterial contamination have not yet been defined. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term effectiveness of various disinfection procedures in order to reduce both culturable and nonculturable (NC) legionellae in different hospital water networks treated with heat, chlorine dioxide, monochloramine, and hydrogen peroxide. The temperature levels and biocide concentrations that proved to give reliable results were analyzed. In order to study the possible effects on the water pipes, we verified the extent of corrosion on experimental coupons after applying each method for 6 months. The percentage of positive points was at its lowest after treatment with monochloramine, followed by chlorine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hyperthermia. Different selections of Legionella spp. were observed, as networks treated with chlorine-based disinfectants were contaminated mainly by Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, hyperthermia was associated with serogroups 2 to 14, and hydrogen peroxide treatment was associated mainly with non-pneumophila species. NC cells were detected only in heat-treated waters, and also when the temperature was approximately 60 degrees C. The corrosion rates of the coupons were within a satisfactory limit for water networks, but the morphologies differed. We confirm here that chemical disinfection controls Legionella colonization more effectively than hyperthermia does. Monochloramine was the most effective treatment, while hydrogen peroxide may be a promising alternative to chlorine-based disinfectants due to its ability to select for other, less virulent or nonpathogenic species.", "label": 0}

Methods and Results: Escherichia coli O157:H7 was starved for 5 days then exposed to 1 ?g ml-1 sodium hypochlorite, suspended in defined media Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with conditioned media, sampled over a 12-h period; and assayed for growth, production of Shiga toxin (Stx), and attachment to HCT-8 cells. During recovery, stressed and control cells grown in conditioned media exhibited greater attachment efficiencies to HCT-8 cells then cells in DMEM alone. Production of Stx by treated cells mimicked Stx production by control cells suggesting that components of conditioned media assist in recovery. Results showed that levels of autoinducer-2 fluctuate during recovery and growth suggesting involvement of a quorum sensing mechanism during the recovery of stressed E. coli O157:H7.

Among the seven isomers, only ?-BHC has a potent insecticidal activity. ?-BHC poisoning symptoms accompanied by the violent tremor of the body, particularly in the legs and abnormal fluttering were consistently correlated with central nervous system effects, and the action was shown on the ganglia rather than on the isolated nerve cord. The excitatory effects of ?-BHC poisoning on spontaneous activity and synaptic function in the sixth abdominal ganglion of the American cockroach result from the presynaptic action that causes an excessive release of acetylcholine. F. Matsumura found the phenomena of cross resistance between ?-BHC, cyclodiene insecticides and GABA (?-aminobutyric acid) antagonist, picrotoxinin, and concluded that the primary target of ?-BHC is the picrotoxinin receptor in the GABA receptor Cl- ion channel complex (GABA-gated chloride channel) and its antagonistic action on GABA receptor results in an excessive release of Ach. In order to study the structure-activity relationship, a number of ?-BHC analogs, in which one or two chlorine atoms on dl or meso position(s) of the ?-BHC molecule were replaced by various substituents such as hydrogen, halogens other than chlorine and alkoxy groups, etc. were synthesized.

The four treatment setups comprised a factorial combination of the presence/absence of alfalfa with the non-inoculation/inoculation of soil with S. meliloti in a completely randomized design with two replicates. Up to 44 days after planting, when the alfalfa was not fully developed, alfalfa and S. meliloti together were the most effective in PCB transformation/depletion, whereas alfalfa only was the least effective. However, by the last day of the experimental period (Day 270), when alfalfa growth was robust and full, alfalfa alone was the most effective, whereas S. meliloti alone was the least. In rhizobium-inoculated soil, soil hardness increased, soil moisture contents decreased, and both plant growth and yield were lowered, compared to non-inoculated soil. The depletion, loss or change in PCB levels may be attributed to either direct or indirect biotransformation, biotranslocation and adsorption of PCBs due to the presence of alfalfa and/or rhizobial inoculation. Either possibility underscores the possibility of using plant-rhizobacterial associations to phytoremediate soils contaminated with PCBs.", "label": 0}

The development of nucleoside analogs for clinical treatment of hepatitis C presents a similar scenario in which taking shortcuts may help quickly advance a program, but there is always a tremendous risk of being sent backwards as one competes for the finish line. In recent years the treatment options for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have expand due to the development of a replicon based in vitro evaluation system, allowing for the identification of multiple drugable viral targets along with a concerted and substantial drug discovery effort. Three major drug targets have reached clinical study for chronic HCV infection: the NS3/4A serine protease, the large phosphoprotein NS5A, and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Recently, two oral HCV protease inhibitors were approved by the FDA and were the first direct acting anti-HCV agents to result from the substantial research in this area.

Eight of these metabolites are new compounds and some contain an unprecedented chlorine-bearing THF-type ring in the side chain. The library of endoperoxide derivatives was evaluated for in vitro activity against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Leishmania donovani. Some compounds, such as manadoperoxide B, exhibited ultrapotent trypanocidal activity (IC50 = 3 ng mL(-1)) without cytotoxicity. Detailed examination of the antitrypanosomal activity data and comparison with those available in the literature for related dioxane derivatives enabled us to draw a series of structure-activity relationships. Interestingly, it appears that minor structural changes, such as a shift of the methyl group around the dioxane ring, can dramatically affect the antitrypanosomal activity. This information can be valuable to guide the design of optimized antitrypanosomal agents based on the dioxane scaffold.", "label": 0}

Cryo-SEM images showed that E. coli O157:H7 formed a biofilm within 12 h on the rind surface. For rind samples treated with LAE or SHC, the residual cell counts were significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) between 2 and 12 h incubation, and between 2 and 24 h of incubation. For the 2 h incubation samples, E. coli O157:H7 was undetectable (&gt; 5-log reduction) after treatment with 2000 ?g/mL of LAE or SHC.

As the length of the lag phase (CT(lag)) is not known, Bayesian statistics provides a more accurate approach than traditional statistical methods to fitting the delayed Chick-Watson kinetics.

In addition, it is important to improve the techniques that are currently used to extrapolate animal data to humans by performing proper species comparisons. In vitro models offer new opportunities for us to fill in some of these gaps in our knowledge. Furthermore, in view of the ever-increasing number of chemicals that need to be monitored, in vitro models can be used as bioassays, thereby detecting compounds or groups of compounds by their biological activity rather than by their physicochemical properties.

{"id": "4186", "title": "Chlorination or monochloramination: Balancing the regulated trihalomethane formation and microbial inactivation in marine aquaculture waters", "abstract": "Disinfection methods like chlorination are increasingly used to sanitize the water, equipment, tools and surfaces in aquaculture facilities. This is to improve water quality, and to maintain a hygienic environment for the wellbeing of aquatic organisms. However, chlorination can result in formation of regulated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) that can be carcinogenic and toxic. This study aims to evaluate if an optimal balance can be achieved between minimal regulated DBP formation and effective microbial inactivation with either chlorination or monochloramination for application in the Red Sea aquaculture waters. Upon chlorination, the concentration of total trihalomethanes (THMs), primarily bromoform, exceeded the regulatory limit of 80 mu g/L even at the lowest tested concentration of chlorine (1 mg/L) and contact time (1 h). Comparatively, regulated THMs concentration was only detectable at 30 mu g/L level in one of the three sets of monochloraminated marine aquaculture waters. The average log reduction of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) by chlorine ranged from 2.3-log to 3.2-log with different contact time. The average log reduction of ARB by monochloramine was comparatively lower at 1.9 to 2.9-log. Although viable Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from monochloraminated samples as opposed to chlorinated samples, the abundance of S. aureus was not high enough to result in any significant microbial risks. Both chlorination and monochloramination did not provide any significant improvement in the reduction of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study demonstrates that a systematic evaluation is needed to determine the optimal disinfectant required to balance both microbial and chemical risks. Compared to chlorine, monochloramine may be a more appropriate disinfection strategy for the treatment of aquaculture effluents prior to discharge or for recirculatory use in the aquaculture facility.", "label": 1}

Methods: A parental IM9 cell line and two IM9 drug-resistant IM9 sublines were used. With flow cytometry technique the rates of chlorines accumulation in different IM9 cells and values were related to the extent of multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. Results: Using P-gp 170-specific antibodies and fluorescent probe JC-1 an increased expression and function activity of P-gp 170 was detected for drug-resistant cells. It was obtained that drug-resistant IM9 cells accumulated chlorines to a lesser extent than the respective wild type, however the differences did not exceed 30%. Verapamil, cyclosporine, known to reverse the MDR phenotype affects equally IM9-Vinc IM9-Tax and Im9 cells. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the P-gp 170 does not appear to play a role in the intracellular accumulation of chlorines. Since the enhanced activity of P-gp 170 in tumor cells is a factor of their resistance to the action of various antitumor drugs, we conclude that photodynamic therapy could be useful in killing cells exhibiting the MDR.", "label": 0}

In 2010, we conducted 398 household surveys in two informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya with isolated cholera cases. We tested source and household water for free chlorine residual (FCR) and Escherichia coli in approximately 200 households. International guidelines are >/=0.5 mg/L FCR at source, >/=0.2 mg/L at household, and <1 E. coli/100 mL. In these two settlements, 82% and 38% of water sources met FCR guidelines; and 7% and 8% were contaminated with E. coli, respectively. In household stored water, 82% and 35% met FCR guidelines and 11% and 32% were contaminated with E. coli, respectively. Source water FCR>/=0.5 mg/L (p=0.003) and reported purchase of a household water treatment product (p=0.002) were associated with increases in likelihood that household stored water had >/=0.2 mg/L FCR, which was associated with a lower likelihood of E. coli contamination (p<0.001). These results challenge the assumption that water quality in informal settlements is universally poor and the route of disease transmission, and highlight that providing centralized water with >/=0.5 mg/L FCR or (if not feasible) household water treatment technologies reduces the risk of waterborne cholera transmission in informal settlements.", "label": 0}

Substituents on the inhibitor scaffold were varied to optimize target potency, antibacterial activity and in vivo pharmacokinetic stability. By incorporating an imidazole ring at the 7-position of scaffold, high target potency was achieved due to a hydrogen bonding network that occurs between the 3-position nitrogen atom, a bridging water molecule and the side chains Ser152 and Trp244 of the enzyme. The lipophilicity of the scaffold series proved important for expression of antibacterial activity. Clearances in vitro and in vivo were monitored to identify compounds with improved plasma stability.

Biofilms of 4 selected strains were also produced either on pure cultures or on co-cultures with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1), at 12 \u00b0C and at 37 \u00b0C. For these biofilms, the minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs) of 4 commercial dairy sanitizers (1 alkyl amine acetate based--T99, 2 chlorine based--T66 and DD, and 1 phosphoric acid based--BP) were determined. Listeria monocytogenes biofilms grown, either at 37 \u00b0C or 12 \u00b0C, were able to achieve similar cell densities by using different incubation periods (24 h and 7 d, respectively). In co-culture biofilms, P. aeruginosa was the dominant species, either at 37 \u00b0C or at 12 \u00b0C, representing 99% of a total biofilm population of 6 to 7 log CFU/peg. Co-culture biofilms were generally less susceptible than L. monocytogenes pure cultures. More interestingly, the biofilms produced at 12 \u00b0C were usually less susceptible to the sanitizers than when produced at 37 \u00b0C. Single or co-culture biofilms of L. monocytogenes and PAO1, particularly produced at 12 \u00b0C, retrieved MBEC values for agents T99 and BP that were, at times, above the maximum in-use recommended concentrations for these agents. The results presented here reinforce the importance of the temperature used for biofilm formation, when susceptibility to sanitizers is being assessed. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Since most food plants have cold wet growth niches in production and storage areas, susceptibility testing should be performed on biofilms produced at refrigeration temperatures. Moreover, the efficiency of the sanitizers used in food industries should be performed on mixed culture biofilms, since in field conditions these will predominate. The results presented here highlight the importance of the temperature used for biofilm formation, when susceptibility to disinfectants is being assessed, as biofilms produced at lower temperature were less susceptible to sanitizers.", "label": 0}

Further, the electrochemical properties of the representative compounds (7e, 8e and 9e) were evaluated and a definite correlation between the redox potential and the antiproliferative activity. The most potent compound 9e displayed significant anti-leukemic activity with IC50 value of 3.8??M in HL-60 cells and weak cytotoxicity with IC50 of 40.7??M in normal cells WI-38. In mechanistic study for 9e, the increased numbers of apoptotic cells and increased cell population at G2/M phase correlated with ROS generation.

Viable V. cholerae could still be recovered from rugose cultures even after exposure to 2.0 mg l-1 free chlorine for 30 min. Preliminary studies suggest that resistance to killing by chlorine was due to formation of cell aggregates enclosed in a gelatinous mucoid material. Rugose strains appeared to be fully virulent, based on their ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells and elicit fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loops.

This study describes the development of a quantitative cell culture infectivity assay for E. intestinalis and its application to assess inactivation by ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. The method described here employs calcofluor white, a fluorescent brightener that targets the chitin spore wall, to visualize groups of developing spores in order to confirm infectivity. Serial dilutions of the spore suspension were seeded into tissue culture well slides containing RK-13 cells. Slides were then rinsed, fixed in methanol and stained with calcofluor white and examined microscopically. Large masses of developing spores were easily visible on infected cell monolayers. Positive and negative wells at each dilution step were used to quantify the number of infectious spores in the original suspension using a most-probable-number (MPN) statistical analysis. This assay was used to evaluate the disinfecting potential of ultraviolet light on E. intestinalis spores in water. The ultraviolet dose required for a 3-log10 or 99.9% reduction in the number of infective spores was determined to be 8.43 mW s/cm2.", "label": 0}

To understand how nitrification develops, a study was conducted to examine the factors that influence the occurrence of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in a chloraminated distribution system. Samples were collected over an 18-month period from a raw-water source, a conventional treatment plant effluent, and two covered, finished-water reservoirs that previously experienced nitrification episodes. Sediment and biofilm samples were collected from the interior wall surfaces of two finished-water pipelines and one of the covered reservoirs. The AOB were enumerated by a most-probable-number technique, and isolates were isolated and identified. The resistance of naturally occurring AOB to chloramines and free chlorine was also examined. The results of the monitoring program indicated that the levels of AOB, identified as members of the genus Nitrosomonas, were seasonally dependent in both source and finished waters, with the highest levels observed in the warm summer months. The concentrations of AOB in the two reservoirs, both of which have floating covers made of synthetic rubber (Hypalon; E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Inc., Wilmington, Del.), had most probable numbers that ranged from <0.2 to >300/ml and correlated significantly with temperature and levels of heterotrophic plate count bacteria. No AOB were detected in the chloraminated reservoirs when the water temperature was below 16 to 18\u00b0C. The study indicated that nitrifiers occur throughout the chloraminated distribution system. Higher concentrations of AOB were found in the reservoir and pipe sediment materials than in the pipe biofilm samples. The AOB were approximately 13 times more resistant to monochloramine than to free chlorine. After 33 min of exposure to 1.0 mg of monochloramine per liter (pH 8.2, 23\u00b0C), 99% of an AOB culture was inactivated. The amounts of this disinfectant that are currently used (1.5 mg/liter at a 3:1 ratio of chlorine to ammonia-N) may be inadequate to control the growth of these organisms in the distribution system.", "label": 0}

However, previous studies have not compared the effect of DNA-lipid to DNA alone. Recently, we developed a formulation of plasmid encoding CFTR (pCF1-CFTR) and cationic lipid (GL-67:DOPE) that generated greater gene transfer in mouse lung than previously described DNA-lipid vectors. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that DNA-lipid complexes were more effective than DNA alone at transferring CFTR cDNA to airway epithelia in vivo. We administered complexes of DNA-lipid to one nostril and DNA alone to the other nostril in a randomized, double-blind study. Electrophysiologic measurements showed that DNA-lipid complexes partially corrected the Cl- transport defect. Importantly, the pCF1-CFTR plasmid alone was at least as effective as complexes of DNA with lipid. Measurements of vector-specific CFTR transcripts also showed gene transfer with both DNA-lipid and DNA alone. These results indicate that nonviral vectors can transfer CFTR cDNA to airway epithelia and at least partially restore the Cl- transport defect characteristic of CF.

For the MPN-based tests, k was approximately 1,000-fold higher. Although CT99 values from the MPN-based experiments agreed with CT99 reported elsewhere for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), the lower inactivation rates estimated from the bacterial viability tests were more consistent with AOB persistence in distribution systems, suggesting that MPN may overestimate chloramine biocide effectiveness.

The impact of population growth was assessed in terms of plant design, operational capacity (flow rate) and other treatment process constraints. Between 2001 and 2007, the number of households connected to the public sewerage service increased by 15.5, 17.2 and 37.8\u00a0% in Emfuleni, Lesedi and Midvaal Local Municipalities, respectively. Soshanguve revealed a 50\u00a0% increment in the number of households connected to the sewerage system between 1996 and 2001. Except for Sandspruit (?393.8\u00a0%), the rate of influent flows received by Meyerton increased by 6.8\u00a0ML/day (67.8\u00a0%) and 4.7\u00a0ML/day (46.8\u00a0%) during the dry and wet seasons, respectively.

Underperformance of the existing wastewater treatment plants suggests that the rapid population growth in urban and peri-urban areas (hydraulic overloading of the wastewater treatment plants) and operational constraints (overflow rate, retention time, oxygen supply capacity of the plants and chlorine contact time) resulted in the production of poor quality effluents in both selected areas.

This study examines whether the enhanced net chloride secretion during rotavirus infection in young rabbits may occur as a result of hypersecretion in crypt cells that would exceed the substantial Cl- reabsorption observed in villi. By using a rapid filtration technique, we evaluated transport of 36Cl and D-14C glucose across brush border membrane (BBM) vesicles purified from villus tip and crypt cells isolated in parallel from the entire small intestine. Rotavirus infection impaired SGLT1-mediated Na+-D-glucose symport activity in both villus and crypt cell BBM, hence contributing to the massive water loss along the crypt-villus axis. In the same BBM preparations, rotavirus failed to stimulate the Cl- transport activities (Cl-/H+ symport, Cl-/anion exchange and voltage-activated Cl- conductance) at the crypt level, but not at the villus level, questioning, therefore, the origin of net chloride secretion. We propose that the chloride carrier might function in both normal (absorption) and reversed (secretion) modes in villi, depending on the direction of the chloride electrochemical gradient resulting from rotavirus infection, agreeing with our results that rotavirus accelerated both Cl- influx and Cl- efflux rates across villi BBM.

According to cyclic polarization data, types 304 SS (UNS S30400) and 316 SS (UNS S31600) were resistant to pit initiation after 8 weeks of exposure to ozonated artificial seawater. However, when crevices existed, crevice corrosion was more severe in ozonated vs aerated artificial seawater Maximum crevice corrosion penetration rates of 8 mm/y and 5 mm/y (0.315 in./y and 0.197 in./y) were recorded for types 304 and 316 SS, respectively, in ozonated artificial seawater compared to only 0.4 mm/y to 0.5 mm/y (0.016 in./y io 0.020 in./y) under aerated conditions. Mixed-potential analysis sis of anodic and cathodic polarization predicted crevice corrosion rates for type 316 SS in excellent agreement with the immersion sample data. Highly alloyed nickel-, chromium-, molybdenum-, and nitrogen-bearing austenitic SS were resistant to crevice corrosion in aerated and ozonated artificial seawater. However, differential oxidation corrosion was observed between surfaces of high and low ozone concentration, leading to local transpassive dissolution manifested as surface etching and superficial intergranular corrosion (IGC). After 47 weeks of exposure to ozonated artificial seawater, microscopic pitting was observed in crevices of the highly alloyed SS. Although IGC and microscopic pitting of highly alloyed SS were not considered severe, these modes of corrosion warrant further investigation in the interest of corrosion resistance in long-term (>1 year) service under oxidizing conditions in seawater.", "label": 0}

They are either persistent or resistant to microbial degrdn. (recalcitrant) and considered to be toxic compds. having the potential to injure humans and other organisms, even at low concns. This article presents a review of recent work on microbial degrdn. of CAH, with emphasis on the applications of bacteria either alone or in combination with some others microorganisms. The removal of chlorine substituent is a key step in biodegrdn. of chlorinated arom. compds. Dechlorination can occur through oxidative, hydrolytic or reductive dehalogenation process. The cleavage of the arom. ring is the significant step after the dechlorination in the degrdn. of CAH, and arom. ring is opened by oxidative \"ortho cleavage\", resulting in formation of intermediate cis, cis-muconic acid. Chlorobenzenes with four or less chlorine groups are susceptible to oxidn. by aerobic bacteria that grow on such compds. as the sole source of carbon and energy. The dechlorination of chlorinated benzenes and p-chlorobenzenes (PCBs) is catalyzed by halorespiring bacteria of the genus Dehalococcoides whereas the dehalogenation of chlorophenols and chlorinated benzoates is catalyzed predominantly by halorespiring bacteria in the genus Desulfitobacterium and Desulfomonile, resp. The most well studied strains utilizing polychlorinated phenols (PCPs) belong to the genera Mycobacterium and Sphingomonas. The chlorophenoxy herbicide can be metabolized to chlorophenol. Chlorophenol may in turn be metabolized to chloroanisoles, however, the most common route of biodegrdn. is to chlorocatechol. Chlorocatechol, in turn may be metabolized by several different mechanism to non chlorinated ring cleavage product. Chlorobenzoates are readily biodegraded in the environment to CO2 and Cl-. Higher chlorinated biphenyls are susceptible to reductive dehalogenation resulting in the formation of lower chlorinated biphenyls in anaerobic environments while lower chlorinated biphenyls are susceptible to oxidn. by aerobic bacteria.

The antiproliferative activity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated by an in vitro assay on human tumor cell lines (HL-60 and HeLa) and showed a significant capacity of the 7-methoxy-substituted benzothiopyrano[4,3-c]pyrazoles 3b\u2013d, carrying the pendant phenyl group in the 1-position, to inhibit cell growth. Investigation of the mechanism of action indicated the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) as the molecular event responsible for the inhibition of cell growth. This phenomenon is related to the ability of the test compounds to cause a rapid Ca2+-dependent and cyclosporin A-sensitive collapse of the transmembrane potential (??) and matrix swelling. All this leads to the release of caspase activators, such as cytochrome c (cyt c) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which trigger the pro-apoptotic pathway leading to DNA fragmentation.", "label": 0}

A descriptive study of 26 LTCFs in South Carolina was conducted to determine the presence of environmental factors associated with transmission of human noroviruses. Sanitary conditions in one common area, one staff/visitor bathroom, and the main kitchen were assessed using two audit forms. While surfaces in all kitchens were in good sanitary condition, 23 LTCFs used quaternary ammonium-based sanitizers and three LTCFs used chlorine bleach for kitchen sanitization. All common areas were also clean and in good condition; however, 20 LTCFs had upholstered chairs, and five LTCFs had carpeted floors. Seven facilities used quaternary ammonium-based disinfectants exclusively, whereas six LTCFs used chlorine bleach exclusively, and eight LTCFs used both to disinfect common areas. Seven staff/visitor bathrooms were accessible to residents, and hand washing signage was missing from 10.

Clinical signs vary from asymptomatic to small bowel diarrhea and associated discomfort. The control of infections in dogs is frequently a frustrating issue for animal owners and veterinarians. Drugs with antiprotozoal activity such as fenbendazole and metronidazole are recommended, however, they do not show 100% efficacy and superinfections occur regularly. Ronidazole is currently the drug of choice for the treatment of Tritrichomonas foetus in cats and there is now limited information available about its efficacy against Giardia spp. In the kennel investigated, dogs regularly showed loose feces and the presence of Giardia (assemblage C, renamed as G. canis) cysts. An elimination strategy of this parasite involving strict hygiene management and disinfection of the enclosures with 4-chlorine-M-cresol, oral treatment with ronidazole (30-50 mg/kg BW bid for 7 days) and two shampooings (containing chlorhexidine) at the beginning and the end of the treatments was implemented for a group of 6 dogs. As a control another group of 7 dogs was transferred to the disinfected enclosures and shampooed, but left untreated. Dog feces were tested for the presence of Giardia cysts (SAF concentration technique) or Giardia antigen with a commercial ELISA (NOVITE (R)) and a quick immunochromatography-based test (SensPER (R)) before and between 5 and 40 days after the last treatment. All ronidazole-treated dogs were negative for Giardia cysts and antigen up to 26 days after the last treatment, while between 1 and 5 of the control animals tested positive in each of the test series. At this point, also dogs of the control group were again moved into clean enclosures, shampooed twice and treated with ronidazole. Five, 12 and 19 days after the last treatment, the dogs in the control group tested negative for Giardia cysts and antigen. However, all animals had again positive results at later time points in at least one of the three applied diagnostic techniques within 33-61 days after treatment. Furthermore, all dogs had episodes of diarrhea (for 1-4 days) within 14-31 days after treatment and unformed feces during the whole experiment. The positive effect of ronidazole against Giardia infections in dogs could be confirmed in this study. In particular, the combination of ronidazole treatment combined with the disinfection of the environment and shampooing of the dogs was highly effective in reducing Giardia cyst excretion and may therefore constitute an alternative control strategy for canine giardiosis.

However, clinicians continue to debate the clinical effectiveness of this tool. METHODS: Prospective analysis of data from the International Surgical Outcomes Study (ISOS), an international observational study of elective in-patient surgery, accompanied by a systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature. The exposure was surgical safety checklist use. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and the secondary outcome was postoperative complications. In the ISOS cohort, a multivariable multi-level generalized linear model was used to test associations. To further contextualise these findings, we included the results from the ISOS cohort in a meta-analysis. Results are reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: We included 44 814 patients from 497 hospitals in 27 countries in the ISOS analysis. There were 40 245 (89.8%) patients exposed to the checklist, whilst 7508 (16.8%) sustained >/=1 postoperative complications and 207 (0.5%) died before hospital discharge. Checklist exposure was associated with reduced mortality [odds ratio (OR) 0.49 (0.32-0.77); P<0.01], but no difference in complication rates [OR 1.02 (0.88-1.19); P=0.75]. In a systematic review, we screened 3732 records and identified 11 eligible studies of 453 292 patients including the ISOS cohort.

Treatment of these organisms, in pure culture, with ED water at concentrations of 25, 50, 75, and 100 ppm total residual chlorine (TRC) and 10 min of contact time resulted in a 6 log(10) spores/mL reduction of both organisms. A dip treatment or a dip and daily spray treatment of EO water were used to evaluate its ability to prevent or delay the onset of surface infection on fruit during postharvest packaging and in retail shelf environments. A 10 minute dip treatment of surface inoculated peaches (M. fructicola) in EO water prevented infection for 3 days and resulted in a 12.5% incidence of infection and a disease severity rating of 6% after 5 days of storage at 25 degrees C. Dipping of green table grapes inoculated with B. cinerea into EO water prevented infection for 7 days and resulted in a 1% incidence of infection and a disease severity rating of 2% after 10 days of storage at 25 degrees C. A dip and daily spray of peaches with EO water prevented infection for 12 days and resulted in a 10% incidence of infection and a 6% disease severity after 14 days of storage at 25 degrees C. A dip and daily spray of grapes with EO water prevented infection for 24 days and resulted in a 2% incidence of infection and a disease severity rating of 2% after 26 days of storage at 25 degrees C. The results from this study suggest that these solutions may prove to be effective for postharvest sanitation of fruit surfaces prior to packaging and may increase the shelf life of the fruit in commercial settings.

The pots were watered daily with two different levels of salinity, (a) fresh water (0 mM NaCl) and (b) salt water (40 mM NaCl). The results showed that salinity led to a decrease of fresh wt. (FW) prodn. and relative water content (RWC), while specific leaf wt. (SLW) was increased. No significant differences in dry wt. (DW) and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of stressed plants. Modifying substrate (SSP) led to maintain plant growth under salinity condition, whereas the substrate texture was ameliorated to more porosity and permeability. The salinity enhanced an increase in the Na+ and Cl- accumulation of plant with different types of substrate treatments. While, the SSP substrate type showed a reduce in Cl- accumulation under salinity treatments. However, the redn. in growth under NaCl treatment can be attributed to an accumulation of salts thereby decrease in osmotic potential with respect of toxicity from NaCl. Despite the parameters indicate to reduce the growth under salinity, the plant biomass was maintained with SSP substrate type. Our overall results indicate that the soil amendment would ameliorate the ability of plant from inhibitory effects of NaCl stress in plants by reduce Cl- accumulation thereby enhance plant tolerance.

For this study, a commercial lettuce washing process was simulated using two subsequent washing baths (WB). The worst case scenario, when no sanitizers are used and still common in some European countries, was investigated to fully understand the potential for cross-contamination and to obtain baseline data for further risk assessment. The two cross-contamination processes (from lettuce to water and from water to lettuce) were included in the simulation study and the transfer of Escherichia coli, E. coli O157, MS2 phage and murine norovirus was quantified. The mean reduction of initially contaminated lettuce through the washing in two successive WB was limited: 0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0log\u00a0CFU E.\u00a0coli/g after washing in WB1 and an additional reduction of 0.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 log after WB2. The microbial load of the water in the washing baths, initially starting off with potable water, increased rapidly during the washing process of the contaminated lettuce. Furthermore to quantify the transfer of the four implicated micro-organisms from contaminated water to the lettuce, the first washing bath was inoculated with either approximately 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0\u00a0log\u00a0CFU E.\u00a0coli/100\u00a0ml or 4.8, 5.6 or 6.7\u00a0log\u00a0CFU E.\u00a0coli O157/100\u00a0ml, 4.0, 5.1 or 6.5\u00a0log\u00a0PFU MS2 phages/100\u00a0ml or 6.5\u00a0log\u00a0PFU/100\u00a0ml norovirus surrogate MNV-1. The contamination of the subsequently washed lettuce portions resulted in levels of ca. 1.0 up to 1.9\u00a0log\u00a0CFU E.\u00a0coli/g after passing the two washing steps. In addition, after a rapid initial increase, due to spill over of water from WB 1 to WB2, the contamination of WB2 further augmented during the washing process to approximately 1.0 to 0.5\u00a0log below the inoculation level of WB1. Transfer of E.\u00a0coli O157, MS2 phages or MNV-1 from the water to the lettuce was respectively 0.9%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3%, 0.5%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2% and 0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1% after WB1 and resulted in a contamination level for the highest inoculum level of WB1 of respectively ca. 2.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0log\u00a0CFU/g, 3.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0log\u00a0PFU/g and 4.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0log\u00a0PFU/g lettuce.

{"id": "4433", "title": "Immunoproteasome-selective and non-selective inhibitors: A promising approach for the treatment of multiple myeloma", "abstract": "The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the major non-lysosomal proteolytic system for the degradation of abnormal or damaged proteins no longer required. The proteasome is involved in degradation of numerous proteins which regulate the cell cycle, indicating a role in controlling cell proliferation and maintaining cell survival. Defects in the UPS can lead to anarchic cell proliferation and to tumor development. For these reasons UPS inhibition has become a significant new strategy for drug development in cancer treatment. In addition to the constitutive proteasome, which is expressed in all cells and tissues, higher organisms such as vertebrates possess two immune-type proteasomes, the thymoproteasome and the immunoproteasome. The thymoproteasome is specifically expressed by thymic cortical epithelial cells and has a role in positive selection of CD8 + T cells, whereas the immunoproteasome is predominantly expressed in monocytes and lymphocytes and is responsible for the generation of antigenic peptides for cell-mediated immunity. Recent studies demonstrated that the immunoproteasome has a preservative role during oxidative stress and is up-regulated in a number of pathological disorders including cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. As a consequence, immunoproteasome-selective inhibitors are currently the focus of anticancer drug design. At present, the commercially available proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib which have been validated in multiple myeloma and other model systems, appear to target both the constitutive and immunoproteasomes, indiscriminately. This lack of specificity may, in part, explain some of the side effects of these agents, such as peripheral neuropathy and gastrointestinal effects, which may be due to targeting of the constitutive proteasome in these tissues. In contrast, by selectively inhibiting the immunoproteasome, it may be possible to maintain the antimyeloma and antilymphoma efficacy while reducing these toxicities, thereby increasing the therapeutic index. This review article will be focused on the discussion of the most promising immunoproteasome specific inhibitors which have been developed in recent years. Particular attention will be devoted to the description of their mechanism of action, their structure-activity relationship, and their potential application in therapy.", "label": 0}

Substitution of an ethyl group with a hydroxyethyl or acetyl group at position 3 of the macrocycle results in a decrease in extinction and intracellular accumulation that finally leads to the reduced photocytotoxicity. Cationic CICD are targeted to lysosomes, and their intracellular penetration occurs most probably via caveolae-dependent endocytosis. Photodynamic treatment with cationic CICD results in the cell death via necrosis at both sub-phototoxic (40-70% of dead cells) and phototoxic (90-100% of dead cells) regimes of cell treatment. Irradiation induces lysosome damage, leakage of CICD from lysosomes and development of protease activity in cytoplasm, whereas mitochondria are not affected with irradiation. A positive charge of cationic CICD modified drastically an internalization pathway, sites of intracellular localization and mechanisms of photoinduced cytotoxicity as compared to previously studied neutral and anionic CICD. Our experiments with different CICD show that varying charge and structure of substituents it is possible to modulate many cellular properties of CICD in order to find the best molecular template of the advanced near-IR photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies.", "label": 0}

Therefore, extracting oocyst DNA is not a trivial undertaking. Standard procedures used to extract DNA from oocysts, such as freeze-Thaw (F/T) methods and DNA purification kits, are time-consuming and expensive and are difficult to implement in routine clinical practice. Therefore, we developed a surfactant extraction treatment (SET) that efficiently extracts DNA from the oocyst. Immunomagnetic separation (IMS) combined with quantitative real-Time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detects pathogenic microorganisms with high sensitivity. The objective of the present study was to evaluate SET for its ability to simplify qPCR detection of 18S rDNA directly from immunomagnetic bead-oocyst conjugates. DNA extracted directly from the conjugates using SET did not affect DNA amplification in the qPCR assay. Further, the rate of DNA amplification using IMS-SET was greater than that using F/T combined with the DNA purification kit. The rate of recovery of oocysts from surface water samples spiked with oocysts did not differ significantly from previously published values.

{"id": "1487", "title": "Assessment of the Fate of Escherichia coli in Different Stages of Wastewater Treatment Plants", "abstract": "Seven full-scale wastewater treatment plants were investigated to highlight the effectiveness of each treatment stage on removing Escherichia coli. The primary sedimentation achieved an average E. coli removal efficiency of 30.5% which was much lower than the suspended solids (58%), thus, revealing the absence of a linear relationship between the two parameters. Biological processes proved to be very important in the removal of E. coli through adsorption inside the sludge flocs and complex decay (mortality). In biological processes with a long retention time, such as activated sludge denitrification-nitrification, the decay was very important, whereas in the more traditional activated sludge process, without nitrification, the contribution of adsorption and mortality was quite balanced. Overall, the mechanical-biological treatment achieved a removal efficiency of 91.8\u201396.5% depending on the process. Additional removal can be achieved by disinfection. The effectiveness of E. coli removal with sodium hypochlorite was strictly depended on the product of residual chlorine (CR) with the contact time (t). The experimental curve fitted the Collins model well, with a standard deviation of less than 7%.", "label": 1}

The strongly acidic \"anode solution\" (EW+) has high levels of dissolved oxygen and available chlorine in a form of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) with a strong potential for sterilization, which we have investigated here. Exposing Aspergillus parasiticus at an initial density of 10(3)spores in 10 microL to a 50-fold volume (500 microL) of EW+ containing ca. 390 micromol HOCl for 15 min at room temperature resulted in a complete inhibition of fungal growth, whereas the cathode solution (EW-) had negligible inhibitory effects. Moreover, the mutagenicity of aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) for Salmonella typhimurium TA-98 and TA-100 strains was strongly reduced after AFB(1) exposure to the EW+ but not with the EW-. In high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, the peak corresponding to AFB(1) disappeared after treatment with the EW+, indicating decomposition of the aflatoxin. In contrast, the routinely used disinfectant sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl, of the same available chlorine content as that of EW+ but in a different chemical form, hypochlorite (OCl-) ion, did not decompose AFB(1) at pH 11. However, NaOCl did decompose AFB(1) at pH 3, which indicated that the principle chemical formula to participate in the decomposition of AFB(1) is not the OCl- ion but HOCl. Furthermore, because the decomposition of AFB(1) was suppressed by pretreating the EW+ with the OH radical scavenger thiourea, the chemical species responsible for the AFB(1)-decomposing property of the EW+ should be at least due to the OH radical originated from HOCl. The OH in EW+ was proved by electron spin resonance analysis.", "label": 1}

Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) have received considerable attention due to their unique antibacterial activities toward various microorganisms that are commonly found in the environment. In the present study, ZnO NPs were synthesized through both mechano-chemical and sol-gel methods. The synthesized ZnO NPs were characterized through X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy techniques. Then, their antibacterial activities against separated wastewater bacteria were evaluated by determining the zone inhibitor, the minimum inhibitory concentration, and the minimum bactericidal concentration. The results were compared with those obtained from wastewater after chlorine disinfection and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. These studies demonstrated that the antibacterial activity of ZnO NPs depends on the type and the strain of bacteria. They have also demonstrated that the activity increases as the concentration of ZnO NPs increases. Overall, the experimental results suggest that ZnO NPs can potentially be an antibacterial reagent to treat wastewater. They can particularly be applied as a complementary method with UV disinfection. Thus, they can be developed as antibacterial agents to improve wastewater quality.", "label": 1}

A modular pilot-scale distribution facility was installed at four waterworks using different raw waters and disinfection regimes. Three-month-old biofilms were analysed using molecular biology and microscopy methods. High total cell numbers, low counts of actively respiring cells and low numbers of cultivable bacteria indicated the high abundance of viable but not cultivable bacteria in the biofilms. The expression of the recA SOS responsive gene was detected and underlined the presence of transcriptionally active bacteria within the biofilms. This effect was most evident after UV disinfection, UV oxidation and UV disinfection with increased turbidity at waterworks compared to chemically treated and non-disinfected systems. Furthermore, live/dead staining techniques and environmental scanning electron microscopy imaging revealed the presence of living and intact bacteria in biofilms on copper substrata.

Lincomycin and its semi-synthetic chlorinated derivative clindamycin are widely used in clinical practice. Both antibiotics are bacteriostatic, inhibiting protein synthesis in sensitive bacteria; however, at higher concentrations, they may be bactericidal. Clindamycin is usually much more active than lincomycin in the treatment of bacterial infections, in particular those caused by anaerobic species; it can also be used for the treatment of important protozoal diseases, e.g. malaria, most effectively in combination with other antibiotic or non-antibiotic antimicrobials (primaquine, fosfidomycin, benzoyl peroxide). Chemical structures of lincosamide antibiotics and the biosynthesis of lincomycin and its genetic control have been summarized and described. Resistance to lincomycin and clindamycin may be caused by methylation of 23S ribosomal RNA, modification of the antibiotics by specific enzymes or active efflux from the bacterial cell.", "label": 0}

Wastewater disinfection helps prevent the spread of these pathogens in aquatic environments. Chlorination is the most widely used method for the disinfection of wastewater, but can cause the formation of mutagenic/carcinogenic and toxic by-products which are potentially harmful to human and aquatic organisms. The aim of this research was to study the influence of disinfectants alternative to chlorine, such as chlorine dioxide, ozone, peracetic acid and UV radiation, on the formation of mutagenic and toxic compounds in wastewater. Wastewater samples were collected before and after disinfection in summer and in winter and then adsorbed using silica C-18 cartridges. Concentrates were tested For mutagenicity using the Ames rest. For toxicity test, a bioluminescence assay using Vibrio fischeri photobacteria was employed. To detect DNA damage activity non-concentrated water samples were tested using two genotoxicity plant tests (Allium test and Tradescantia/micronuclei test). All disinfectant treatments produced bacterial mutagenicity, particularly after treatment with ClO2 or ozone. The Allium cepa test gave positive results only for PAA-treated wastewater sampled in winter and the Tradescantia/MCN test always gave negative results. Raw wastewater, ClO2- and PAA-disinfected waters showed toxic effects in the marine bacteria test. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.", "label": 0}

An in vitro evaluation was performed to determine if E. coli sero group O2 (avian pathogenic) could attach on a PVC surface that had pre-formed biofilm and if this phenomenon could be affected when water was treated with chlorine. Initially, biofilm growth was induced in PVC test coupons (15.16 cm2) for a 7-day period mimicking the waterline scenario in the first wk of poultry brooding; and then this biofilm was challenged with E. coli O2 seeded water in presence/absence of chlorine treatment. After rinsing, test coupons were sampled for bacterial (APC) and E. coli O2 enumeration at various occasions post seeding the pathogen and chlorine treatment. Day 7 APC recovered from coupons was 4.35 log10 cfu/cm2 in trial 1 and 3.66 log10 cfu/cm2 in trial 2. E. coli O2 was not recovered from chlorine treated test coupons (P < 0.05), whereas it was retrieved from untreated coupons (untreated contained > 3 log10 cfu/cm2 in trial 1 and > 2 log10 cfu/cm2 in trial 2). This study suggests that E. coli O2 can incorporate into pre-formed biofilm on a PVC surface within 24 h if water sanitation is not present, and the attachment time of the pathogen can prolong in the absence of already formed biofilm.", "label": 1}

In 2009, a study reported the effectiveness of levulinic acid in combination with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in killing foodborne bacteria. Because of their innocuous properties, we studied the effects of levulinic acid and SDS at various concentrations appropriate for use in foods, on the viability of Cryptosporidium parvum and Encephalitozoon intestinalis. The viability of Cryptosporidium and E. intestinalis was determined by in vitro cultivation using the HCT-8 and RK-13 cell lines, respectively. Two Escherichia coli O157:H7 isolates were also used in the present study: strain 932 (a human isolate from a 1992 Oregon meat outbreak) and strain E 0018 (isolated from calf feces). Different concentrations and combinations of levulinic acid and SOS were tested for their ability to reduce infectivity of C. parvum oocysts (10(5)), E. intestinalis spores (10(6)), and E. coli O157:H7 (10(7)/ml) when in suspension. Microsporidian spores were treated for 30 and 60 min at 20 +/- 2 degrees C. None of the combinations of levulinic acid and SDS were effective at inactivating the spores or oocysts. When Cryptosporidium oocysts were treated with higher concentrations (3% levulinic acid-2% SDS and 2% levulinic acid-1% SDS) for 30, 60, and 120 min, viability was unaffected. E. coli O157:H7, used as a control, was highly sensitive to the various concentrations and exposure times tested. SDS and levulinic acid alone had very limited effect on E. coli O157:H7 viability, but in combination they were highly effective at 30 and 60 min of incubation. In conclusion, Cryptosporidium and microsporidia are not inactivated when treated for various periods of time with 2% levulinic acid-1% SDS or 3% levulinic acid-2% SOS at 20 degrees C, suggesting that this novel sanitizer cannot be used to eliminate parasitic contaminants in foods.", "label": 0}

Results showed that optimum effect of ozone on reducing bacterial populations was achieved with short term exposures of less than 6\u00a0h. Ozone reduced the bacterial population by disrupting bacterial cell structure, which lead to cellular death. Results also showed that bacterial cells have different resistance to ozone where ozone was more effective against L.\u00a0monocytogenes, followed by E.\u00a0coli O157 and Salmonella Typhimurium. Optimal reduction of the bacterial population on fresh-cut bell pepper was achieved with exposure to 9\u00a0ppm ozone for 6\u00a0h.

Furthermore, the use of islets from multiple donors can compound the risks of contamination of individual recipients. Acidic oxidative potential water (also termed electrolyzed strong acid solution, function water, or acqua oxidation water), which was developed in Japan, is a strong acid formed on the anode in the electrolysis of water containing a small amount of sodium chloride. It has these physical properties: pH, from 2.3 to 2.7; oxidative-reduction potential, from 1,000 to 1,100 mV; dissolved chlorine, from 30 to 40 ppm; and dissolved oxygen, from 10 to 30 ppm. Because of these properties, acidic oxidative potential water has strong bactericidal effects on all bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), viruses including HIV, HBV, HCV, CMV, and fungi as a result of the action of the active oxygen and active chlorine that it contains. We conducted this study to evaluate the effect of acidic oxidative potential water irrigation on bacterial contamination on the harvesting of porcine pancreata from slaughterhouses for islet xenotransplantation by counting the number of pancreatic surface bacteria using the Dip-slide method, and on the results of islet culture; and to evaluate the direct effect on isolated islets when it is used to prevent bacterial contamination by the static incubation test and by morphological examination.

The latter treatment achieved an organic content in the boiler feed water of less than 40 mug C. The ozone treatment also reduced the content of trihalomethanes in the drinking water, produced by the same plant, to values in the range of 10 mug/L and even to undetectable values when ozone was combined with hydrogen peroxide, in spite of the postchlorination applied to this stream to ensure a disinfectant capacity though the distribution system.", "label": 1}

Only infectious Ads are detected because they are the only ones able to produce mRNA during replication in cell culture. Three primer sets for RT-PCR amplification of mRNA were evaluated for their sensitivity and specificity: a conserved region of late mRNA transcript encoding a virion structural hexon protein and detecting a wide range of human Ads and two primer sets targeting a region of an early mRNA transcript that specifically detects either Ad2 and Ad5 or Ad40 and Ad41. The mRNAs of infected A549 and Graham 293 cells were recovered from cell lysates with oligo(dT) at different time periods after infection and treated with RNase-free DNase to remove residual contaminating DNA, and then Ad mRNA was detected by RT-PCR assay. The mRNA of Ad2 was detected as early as 6 h after infection at 106 infectious units (W) per cell culture and after longer incubation times at levels as low as 1 to 2 IU per cell culture. The mRNA of Ad41 was detected as soon as 24 h after infection at 106 IU per cell culture and at levels as low as 5 IU per cell culture after longer incubation times. To confirm the detection of only infectious viruses, it was shown that no mRNA was detected from Ad2 and Ad41 inactivated by free chlorine or high doses of collimated, monochromatic (254-nm) UV radiation. Detection of Ad2 mRNA exactly coincided with the presence of virus infectivity detected by cytopathogenic effects in cell cultures, but mRNA detection occurred sooner. These results suggest that mRNA detection by RT-PCR assay in inoculated cell cultures is a very sensitive, specific, and rapid method by which to detect infectious Ads in water and other environmental samples.", "label": 1}

Samples were run in both ultrapure water and final effluent collected from a local wastewater treatment facility. The ultrapure water expts. allowed the products to be easily detected, and the identified products were compared to those found in the wastewater matrix. Wastewater effluent was used as a realistic background matrix for a full-scale wastewater chlorination process. Products with antibiotic properties formed in ultrapure water. In the wastewater effluent, antibacterially active products did not form to a measurable extent. Five transformation products were seen in ultrapure and wastewater effluent samples. Both chlorinated and non-chlorinated transformation products were obsd. While the same products were found in both matrixes, their relative abundance was different; the non-chlorinated product forming preferentially in the wastewater matrix and chlorinated products forming in greater abundance in the ultrapure water matrix. This can be attributed to the competition for chlorine with the wastewater background, inhibiting the formation of active products. Furthermore, bromide was added at concns. of 0.5-5 mg L-1 to both ultrapure water and wastewater matrixes to assess the antibacterial activity of brominated products. The brominated products were obsd., although none of them exhibited antibacterial activity.

In this study, we investigated the impact of the cell growth stage on chlorine disinfection efficiency. Specifically, we evaluated the impact of the growth stage on chlorination resistance by comparing the inactivation efficiencies of two indicator bacterial strains (Escherichia coli K12 and Escherichia coli O157:H7) obtained from various growth phases, using Chick-Watson kinetic parameters. For both E. coli strains (K12 and O157:H7), the inactivation rate constants are the lowest at stationary phase (0.19 and 0.32) compared to those at initial lag (0.54 and 0.76) and exponential growth phase (0.63 and 0.69), respectively. These results suggested that the abundance of resistant subpopulations increases at stressed stationary conditions and E. coli cells obtained from the stationary growth phase exhibited more resistance and lower inactivation efficiency compared to those from the lag and exponential phases. This implies that microbes in wastewater treatment process with varying solids retention times (SRTs, which indicate growth rates) may show different extents of chlorine resistance. Comparison of the coefficient of dilution (n) values in both E. coli strains for the various growth phases suggest that cells seem to be more sensitive to disinfectant concentration at the stationary-lag phase than that at the exponential stage. Comparing the two E. coli strains, higher inactivation rates were observed for the pathogenic O157:H7 than for K12 at different stages of growth. The strain-to-strain variability in survivability to chlorine exposure has to be considered when selecting indicator microorganisms for water quality monitoring.", "label": 1}

In bacteria, in addition to its key role in maintaining the proper oxidation state of protein thiols, glutathione also serves a key function in protecting the cell from the action of low pH, chlorine compounds, and oxidative and osmotic stresses. Moreover, glutathione has emerged as a posttranslational regulator of protein function under conditions of oxidative stress, by the direct modification of proteins via glutathionylation.

We demonstrate that murine norovirus (MNV) infection can significantly impair B cell development in the bone marrow in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) dependent, but interferon signaling independent manner. We also show that MNV replication is more pronounced in the absence of STAT1 in ex vivo cultured B cells. Interestingly, using bone marrow transplantation studies, we found that impaired B cell development requires Stat1-/- hematopoietic cells and Stat1-/- stromal cells, and that the presence of wild-type hematopoietic or stromal cells was sufficient to restore normal development of Stat1-/- B cells. These results suggest that B cells normally restrain norovirus replication in a cell autonomous manner, and that wild-type STAT1 is required to protect B cell development during infection.", "label": 0}

Electrostatic charge, in general, did not cause a significant redn. in chlorine concn. High air pressure spray retained more chlorine and gave a higher ORP than low air pressure. EO water with high initial chlorine concn. achieved at least a 3-4 log10 CFU mL-1 redn. in Listeria monocytogenes populations when sprayed with the spray gun, while spraying with a com. backpack sprayer or a poly-tank sprayer eliminated Listeria population (9.4 log10 CFU mL-1 redns.) completely.

The strawberry natural contaminant microbiota (molds and yeasts, mesophilic aerobic and lactic acid bacteria), physicochemical quality (pH, total titratable acidity, total soluble solids, vitamin C, and color), sensory quality (triangle test) and inactivation of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica intentionally inoculated onto strawberries were analyzed. Ultrasound increased the effect of all chemical compounds in the reduction of aerobic mesophilic, molds and yeasts. The best treatment for those groups of microorganisms was ultrasound combined with peracetic acid (US+PA) that reduced 1.8 and 2.0logcfu/g during 9days of storage. Bactericidal effect of peracetic acid was also improved by ultrasound inactivation of S. enterica, reaching a decimal reduction of 2.1logcfu/g. Moreover, synergistic effects were observed in contaminant natural microbiota inactivation for all tested compounds during storage, without any major physicochemical or sensory alteration to the strawberries. Therefore, ultrasound treatment can improve the effect of sanitizers that are substitutes of chlorine compounds without altering the quality of strawberries during storage.

The organic extract from 300-400 L of water was collected from each station and was subjected to the Ames mutagenicity assay using four genetically mutated strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102) with or without metabolic activation (10% S9). At the same time, several physicochemical characteristics of the samples were measured. Criteria for the mutagenic activity of the water samples were based on the two-fold rule and the significant non-zero slope of the linear dose response curve. In 84% of the samples at least one assay fulfilled both the two-fold rule and the significant slope and could be considered mutagenic. Thirty nine per cent (39%) of the samples were considered to show a strong mutagenic response, as in these samples the simultaneous satisfaction of the two criteria was observed in at least 3 assays out of eight. The mutagenic response was shown to be higher in chlorinated compared to untreated water samples. In the city of Patras, drinking water showed an increased mutagenic potential in comparison to an earlier study, regardless of the disinfecting process (chlorine or chlorine dioxide).

The spray water from the toilet seats had less residual chlorine than their tap water sources. However, the total viable microbial count was below the water-quality standard for tap water. In addition, the heat of the toilet seats' warm-water tanks caused heterotrophic bacteria in the source tap water to proliferate inside the nozzle pipes and the warm-water tanks. Escherichia coli was detected on the spray nozzles of about 5% of the toilet seats, indicating that the self-cleaning mechanism of the spray nozzles was largely functioning properly. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected on about 2% of the toilet seats. P. aeruginosa was found to remain for long durations in biofilms that formed inside warm-water tanks.

Inactivation of Salmonella typhimurium using the nanocomposite was significantly enhanced by the irradiation of the visible light, which is due to the surface plasmon resonance of the AgNPs. Plasmonic electrons of the nanoparticle could be transferred to the oxygen molecules in the bacterial solution to produce reactive oxygen species (ROSs), while the corresponding holes could oxidise chloride ions of the AgCl grain to form chlorine atoms.

The use of ClO2 as an alternative to NaClO for water disinfection is being adopted by the fresh tomato postharvest handling industry. Lack of data to define performance for this specific water sanitizer under commercial conditions is a barrier to setting meaningful standards and audit criteria for water sanitation and associated food safety goals. The current work aims to establish a correlative capacity of the Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP) to ClO2 dose, under different conditions of water turbidity and temperature, and their potential to reflect the efficacy in inactivation of Salmonella enterica in tomato process wash water during primary packing. ORP was monitored at delivered doses of 1, 3 and 5 mg/L ClO2, 10, 25 and 40 degrees C water temperature, and varying turbidity (0,40 and 160 NTU). As main results, inverse correlations between water turbidity, temperature and ORP were observed. An increase in turbidity significantly reduced the final ORP and increased the contact time required for a 5-log inactivation of S. enterica at any assayed temperature. An increase in temperature and ClO2 concentration reduced the contact time and achieved a 6-log reduction of S. enterica within a 2 min of contact time. Additionally, differences in the required contact time were determined for inactivation of seven different S. enterica serovars. ClO2 was effective in achieving a 6-log reduction, or greater, of S. enterica under a range of water quality and temperature. However, water composition strongly affects the dynamic ORP status which can limit total inactivation of S. enterica. Data acquired demonstrated the impacts of water quality and temperature to maintain an effective ORP toward inactivation of S. enterica. The outcomes of these studies will likely be useful in reassessing the current definition of adequate water quality and safety standards where ClO2 is used. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The process of inactivation involves the disinfectant in the liquid diffusing towards the bacteria sites and thereafter reacting with bacteria at rates determined by the respective reaction rates. Such processes have demonstrated an initial lag phase followed by an active depletion phase of bacteria. This paper attempts to study the importance of the combined effects of diffusion of the disinfectant through the outer membrane of the bacteria and transport through the associated concentration boundary layers (CBLs) during the initial lag phase. Mathematical equations are developed correlating the initial concentration of the disinfectant with time required for reaching a critical concentration (C?) at the inner side of the membrane of the cell based on diffusion of disinfectant through the outer membranes of the bacteria and the formation of concentration boundary layers on both sides of the membranes. Experimental data of the lag phases of inactivation already available in the literature for inactivation of Bacillus subtilis spores with ozone and monochloramine are tested with the equations. The results seem to be in good agreement with the theoretical equations indicating the importance of diffusion process across the outer cell membranes and the resulting CBL\u2019s during the lag phase of disinfection.", "label": 0}

However, C. difficile can be prevented using microorganisms such as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, a prophylactic agent that has been proven to be effective against it in recent tests or it can be controlled by sporicidal disinfectants. These disinfectants against spores should be evaluated according to a known and recommended standard. Unfortunately, some newly manufactured disinfectants like Bioxy products have not yet been tested. ASTM E2197-11 is a standard test that uses stainless steel disks (1 cm in diameter) as carriers, and the performance of the test formulation is calculated by comparing the number of viable test organisms to that on the control carriers. Surface tests are preferable for evaluating disinfectants with sporicidal effects on hard surfaces. This study applies improved methods, based on the ASTM E2197-11 standard, for evaluating and comparing the sporicidal efficacies of several disinfectants against spores of C. difficile and B. amyloliquefaciens, which are used as the test organisms. With the improved method, all spores were recovered through vortexing and membrane filtration. The results show that chlorine-based products are effective in 5 min and Bioxy products at 5% w/v are effective in 10 min. Although Bioxy products may take longer to prove their effectiveness, their non-harmful effects to hospital surfaces and people have been well established in the literature.", "label": 0}

For comparative purposes, the current investigation was designed to assess the respiratory responses of the mouse to this irritant gas. Towards this end, respiratory physiological responses were measured in female C57Bl/6J mice exposed to 0.6 to 3.0 ppm chlorine. Chlorine was a potent sensory irritant, with an RD50 of 2.3 ppm. Chlorine exposure produced airway obstruction as indicated by a concentration dependent increase in specific airways resistance (sRaw) during exposure, which persisted for fifteen minutes post exposure. At 0.6 ppm, chlorine produced mild sensory irritation ( < 20% change in breathing frequency) and significant obstruction (65% increase in sRaw). Pretreatment with atropine was without effect on the obstructive response suggesting the lack of involvement of cholinergic pathways. Pretreatment with the sensory nerve toxin, capsaicin, dramatically reduced both the sensory irritation and obstructive responses, strongly suggesting the involvement of sensory nerves. Studies were also performed using the surgically isolated upper respiratory tract of the anesthetized mouse. Chlorine was efficiently scrubbed from the airstream ( > 95%) in that site and produced an obstructive response that was of sufficient magnitude to account for the entire response observed in the intact animal. In summary, chlorine gas produces an immediate nasal obstructive response in the mouse that appears to be similar to that in the human.", "label": 0}

However, excessive biological growth is a major challenge associated with wastewater reuse in cooling systems as it can interfere with normal system operation as well as enhance corrosion and scaling problems. Furthermore, possible emission of biological aerosols (e.g., Legionella pneumophila) with the cooling tower drift can lead to public health concerns within the zone of aerosol deposition. In this study, the effectiveness of pre-formed and in-situ-formed monochloramine was evaluated for its ability to control biological growth in recirculating cooling systems using secondary-treated municipal wastewater as the only makeup water source. Bench-scale studies were compared with pilot-scale studies for their ability to predict system behavior under realistic process conditions. Effectiveness of the continuous addition of pre-formed monochloramine and monochloramine formed in-situ through the reaction of free chlorine with ammonia in the incoming water was evaluated in terms of biocide residual and its ability to control both planktonic and sessile microbial populations. Results revealed that monochloramine can effectively control biofouling in cooling systems employing secondary-treated municipal wastewater and has advantages relative to use of free chlorine, but that bench-scale studies seriously underestimate biocide dose and residual requirements for proper control of biological growth in full-scale systems. Pre-formed monochloramine offered longer residence time and more reliable performance than in-situ-formed monochloramine due to highly variable ammonia concentration in the recirculating water caused by ammonia stripping in the cooling tower. Pilot-scale tests revealed that much lower dosing rate was required to maintain similar total chlorine residual when pre-formed monochloramine was used as compared to in-situ-formed monochloramine. Adjustment of biocide dose to maintain monochloramine residual above 3mg/L is needed to achieve successful biological growth control in recirculating cooling systems using secondary-treated municipal effluent as the only source of makeup water.", "label": 0}

Tri-heme (b558, b595, d) cytochrome bd oxidases presumably utilize a dihemic site composed of high-spin hemes d and b595. We performed a CO photolysis/recombination study of the purified fully reduced cytochrome bd from Escherichia coli. Spectrum of CO photolysis suggests photodissociation of the ligand from heme d and from part of heme b595. This is the first clear evidence of interaction of heme b595 with CO at room temperature. The amount of the heme d-CO species is higher after recombination than before photolysis. In the enzyme population with heme b595 bound to CO, heme d remains unliganded, hence the dihemic O2-reducing pocket in cytochrome bd can bind one rather than two diatomic molecules. Occupancy of the site by one ligand molecule probably blocks access of a second molecule. Thus cytochrome bd exhibits strong negative cooperativity in ligand binding. Immediately after photolysis/recombination CO occupies 100% of the heme d sites, whereas after equilibration, the ligand gets located at heme d in 90\u201395% and at heme b595 in 5\u201310% of the cytochrome.

In the pretreatment of feedwater, suspended, colloidal particles that can foul the membrane are removed by the use of flocculants/coagulants and scale inhibitors. Chlorine is also added to reduce microbial populations that can foul the membrane. Because the addn. of chlorine in the feedwater causes membrane breakdown and reduces its useful life, an objective in the project was to develop a chlorine-resistant polymer for the RO-membrane. Another objective was to prep. and evaluate a more effective pretreatment polymer for removing foulants. In this project a novel, pretreatment polymer was designed, prepd., and found to be as effective as a flocculant during comparative evaluations against existing pretreatment polymers. However, there is still room for improvement because the compns. were not optimized. The novel polymer is a cationic polymer bearing crown-ether moieties for complexing with metal ions, which is designed to provide secondary mechanisms for flocculation that might facilitate settling and filtration. A chlorine-resistant polymer for use in prepn. of the RO-membrane was designed based upon selected functionalities that are known to have inertness towards chlorine. The novel RO-membrane polymer was difficult to realize, but a practical, synthetic route to the necessary monomer was developed. The monomer is water-sol., which may indicate that water flux could be high in a membrane based on the targeted polymer that contains that monomer. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

However, to enable effective com. translation, a need exists for more comprehensive studies on the stability of nonfouling coatings after exposure to different sanitizers. In the current study, the influence of different com. dairy equipment sanitizers on the nonfouling properties of stainless steel modified with electroless Ni-polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coatings was detd. Surface properties, such as dynamic contact angle, surface energy, surface morphol., and elemental compn., were measured before and after the coupons were exposed to the sanitizers for 168 cleaning cycles. The fouling behavior of Ni-PTFE-modified stainless steel coupons after exposure was also evaluated by processing raw milk on a self-fabricated benchtop-scale plate heat exchanger. The results indicated that peroxide sanitizer had only minor effect on the Ni-PTFE-modified stainless steel surface, whereas chlorine- and iodine-based sanitizers influenced the surface properties drastically. The coupons after 168 cycles of exposure to peroxide sanitizer accumulated the least amt. of fouling material (4.44 \u00b1 0.24 mg/cm2) compared with the coupons exposed to the other 3 sanitizers. These observations indicated that the Ni-PTFE nonfouling coating retained antifouling properties after 168 cycles of exposure to peroxide-based sanitizer, supporting their potential application as nonfouling coatings for stainless steel dairy processing equipment.

Reservoirs affected are 2 Hollywood, Lower Stone Canyon, and Encino reservoirs. These reservoirs receive treated surface water from the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant, occasionally blended with local groundwater (Hollywood). For treatment, LADWP pilot tested 4 membrane systems: US Filter/Memcor microfiltration (MF); Pall Corporation MF; Aquasource North America ultrafiltration (UF); and ZENON UF. At the time of evaluation, these membranes were the only ones certified by the California Department of Health Services. Pilot testing, conducted at Hollywood Reservoir from Sept. 1997 to Nov. 1999, compared performance of the approved membrane systems. Flux, rate of fouling, frequency and efficiency of chem. cleaning, and pollutant rejection were evaluated. Permeate turbidity of all membrane systems was consistently <0.1 NTU, regardless of operating flux. Significant log removal (1-3 logs) of particles, including those in the size range of Giardia and Cryptosporidium was achieved by all systems. Minimal removal of total org.

The bactericidal effect of ultrasound and NaOCl was investigated in tryptic soy broth (TSB), on stainless steel and iceberg lettuce. Various concentrations of NaOCl (50, 100, 150, and 200 ppm) were tested along with various ultrasound treatment times (5, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 min). The combined treatment of ultrasound and NaOCl resulted in greater bacterial reductions than either treatment alone, without causing any significant changes in lettuce texture. The synergistic values of combined ultrasound and NaOCl treatments in TSB, on stainless steel, and on iceberg lettuce were 0.01-0.99 log(10) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, 0.01-0.62 log(10) CFU/g, and 0.12-1.66 log(10) CFU/g, respectively. These results suggest that the combination of ultrasound and NaOCl was more effective than each treatment against Listeria monocytogenes, and that this combination can effectively sanitize fresh products such as iceberg lettuce.", "label": 1}

Enterobacteriaceae was the most sensitive microbial group to studied sanitizers according to delta values, while psychrophiles were the most resistant. Based on inactivation modelling and sensory scores, nisin (N-250; 0.250 g L-1), lactoferrin (L-50; 50 g L-1), together with hydrolysed L-50 (LFH), were selected and studied comparing to water-washed (CTRL) and NaOCl (150 mg NaOCl L-1) on FC fennel.

METHODS: In this prospective study, 10 dental units were fitted with separate water reservoir systems. Dental units were maintained with weekly rinses with 1:10 NaClO. Treatment water consisted of 750 milliliters of tap water and one drop of undiluted commercial bleach. Bacterial contamination in the effluent coolant water was assayed via microbiologic culture on a weekly basis. At the end of the study, scanning electron microscopy of the inner surfaces of the dental unit waterlines corroborated the results. RESULTS: All 10 dental units consistently delivered water with less than 10 colony-forming units per milliliter, or CFU/mL, with a mean bacterial contamination of less than 1 CFU/mL. Baseline scanning electron microscopy demonstrated biofilm formation. Scanning electron microscopy at the end of the study demonstrated the lack of features consistent with biofilm formation. Although tri-halomethanes were detected in output water, all samples were below Environmental Protection Agency limits for drinking water. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly treatment with 5.25 percent NaClO diluted 1:10, and concomitant use of chlorinated treatment water (3 parts per million chlorine) consistently attained the proposed American Dental Association goal of fewer than 200 CFU/mL in the unfiltered output. The effects of continuous treatment on dentin and enamel bond strength may require further evaluation. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The success of this protocol suggests that optimal attainment of dental water quality goals may require a combination of approaches.", "label": 1}

One of the major issues associated with testing new technology is determining oocyst viability and infectivity before and after treatment. Because oocysts must be isolated from feces, preparation and pretreatment procedures may affect oocyst infectivity and potentially confound results obtained during survival and disinfection studies. The principal objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of preparation and pretreatment on C. parvum oocyst (Ames, Iowa isolate) infectivity in an in vitro cell culture assay. In vitro excystation, sporozoite yield, and vital dye exclusion using DAPI and PI were used to test viability. A matrix of purification procedures using two defatting agents (ethyl acetate and ethyl ether), cesium chloride (CsCl) and Sheather's solution was evaluated. Effects of immune-magnetic separation (IMS) and bleach treatment were also assessed. Oocysts purified using CsCl alone showed the most consistent infection from experiment to experiment, compared to preparations that were purified using a defatting agent. Defatting agents, IMS and bleach treatment had no detrimental effects on oocyst infectivity, however, considerable variability between oocyst lots was observed. This study determined that both purification processes and age affect oocyst infectivity.", "label": 0}

River reaches up to 3.7 km downstream of WTP's were devoid of freshwater mussels (Unionidae), and tolerance to effluents varied among snails, sphaeriid clams, and the asian clam Corbicula fluminea. Residential communities with septic systems had no measurable impact on mollusk assemblages downstream. Laboratory bioassays with glochidia of Villosa iris yielded the following results: 24 h EC50 and LC50 values of 0.042 mg l-1 and 0.084 mg l-1 monochloramine, respectively; and 24 h EC50 and LC50 of 0.237 mg l-1 and 0.284 mg l-1 unionized ammonia, respectively. Glochidia rank among the most sensitive invertebrates in their tolerance to these toxicants. The snail Pleurocera unciale unciale was moderately sensitive, with 96 h LC50 values of 0.252 mg l-1 monochloramine and 0.742 mg l-1 unionized ammonia.

Analyses of soil nutrients and crop foliage were used to assess possible residual effects of the pseudomonad on soil fertility. The Bandon field site was sown in 1994 with sugarbeet seeds that were either untreated, inoculated with the spontaneous rifampicin-resistant mutant F113Rif, or treated with chemical fungicides. The field was cropped with uninoculated red clover in 1995, The inoculant was recovered at only 2.0 log CFU/root system at the first harvest of clovers, and the F113Rif treatment influenced 5 of 17 levels of readily available nutrients determined by electro-ultrafiltration (EUF) analysis of soil. However. this effect was essentially negligible since it was (1) small in magnitude and of little agronomic significance when compared with reference EUF levels, (2) similar in part to those of the commercial seed treatment and other farming practices followed at Bandon, and (3) not statistically significant when data were analysed at the plot level rather than using results from individual soil samples within plots. Clover leaf composition was investigated at two harvests. The F113Rif treatment had no effect on the 20 foliage parameters studied except a small (15%) transient decrease in foliage chlorine at the first harvest. EUF soil analysis and foliage analysis will be useful in future risk assessment studies of genetically modified derivatives of F113.", "label": 0}

In particular, the increasing demand for exotic and raw food is one of the reasons why reports of foodborne infections, and especially waterborne parasitosis, have increased in the last years. Moreover increasing global demand for protein of animal origin has led to certain farming practices (e.g. aquaculture) increasing in emerging or developing countries, where health monitoring may not be sufficiently implemented. Therefore, high quality epidemiological data are needed which together with biological, economic, social and cultural variables should be taken into account when setting control programs for these increasingly popular production systems in emerging economies. This review focuses on the dietary, social, economic and environmental changes that may cause an increase in human exposure to foodborne parasites. Some examples illustrating these new epidemiological dynamics of transmission foodborne parasitic disease are presented.", "label": 0}

The iodine concentration in cow's milk depends on the iodine intake in the animal's daily rations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first experiment, which lasted for 90 days, investigated the effectiveness of salt licks containing 0 (control group), 150, and 300 mg I/kg (experimental groups) and the effect on the iodine content of cow's milk and blood plasma. The second experiment determined the effect of udder disinfection and iodine teat dipping with iodine disinfectant (experimental group) compared to chlorine dip (control group) on the iodine content of milk and blood plasma. Milk iodine and blood plasma concentrations were meas- ured using the Sandell-Kolthoff method modified by the Bobek and Kolczak procedure. RESULT: Salt licks containing 150 and 300 mg I/kg increased iodine intake by 7.5 and 15.0 mg I/day, respectively. Average iodine intake in the control group was 6.23 mg I/day, and 13.68 and 21.10 mg I/day in the experimental groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in the average cows' milk yield, which averaged 21.0 +/- 1.1 kg/day. Average milk iodine content was 53.8 mug/1000 mL (control group), 65.0 and 84.7 mug/1000 mL (experimental groups). Average plasma iodine content tended to increase in the experimental groups, but the differences between the groups were not significant. In the second experiment iodine udder disinfection and teat dipping increased average milk iodine content from 44.0 +/- 1.6 to 59.3 +/- 2.3 mug/1000 mL. Average plasma iodine content increased only slightly, with a non- significant difference between the control and experimental groups. CONCLUSION: The iodine content of salt licks at 150 and 300 mg I/kg makes it possible to obtain from 65 to 85 mug I/1000 mL of cow's milk. Pre-milking udder hygiene and post-milking iodine teat dipping additionally increase the iodine content of milk by around 15 mug I/1000 mL milk, i.e. an increase of 35% in relation to cows from the control group.", "label": 0}

The consumption of RTE vegetables has increased in Brazil over the last two decades, but little is known about the risks associated to the consumption of these products. This study evaluated the prevalence and counts of L. monocytogenes in 512 packages of ready-to-eat vegetables marketed in S\u00e3o Paulo. The isolates were characterized for their serotypes, ribotypes, positivity for virulence genes inlA, inlC and inlJ, resistance to chlorine, growth rate variability and capability to form biofilm on stainless steel (AISI 304, #4) coupons. L. monocytogenes was detected in 3.1% of the samples. Only five samples presented countable levels, with counts between 1.0\u00d7101 and 2.6\u00d7102CFU/g. Isolates belonged to serotypes 1/2b or 4b and most were positive for genes inlC and inlJ. Ribotypable isolates were grouped into four groups: 1038 (69.4%), 19175 (11.3%), 19191 (17.7%) and 18604 (one isolate). Most isolates survived to exposure to 125ppm of a chlorine-based disinfectant for 3min. All isolates were capable to attach to the coupons, reaching counts above 4log10 CFU/cm2 and the growth rate (?) at 25\u00b0C of the majority of the isolates varied between 0.1 and 0.2 log OD/h, but for few strains the ? was as high as 0.26log OD/h.

{"id": "9231", "title": "Outcome Of Early Developmental PCB-Exposure In 42-Months-Old Children: Results From The Multicentric European Cohort Study", "abstract": "Background and Rationale: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBS) a stable environmental contaminant mixtures consisting of up to 209 congeners differing from each other by the number and position of chlorine atoms on the two basic benzene rings. Four marker congeners (IUPAC no 118, 138, 153, 180) are typically measured to quantify PCB-levels in biological and environmental material. PCBs are lipophilic, resistant to biodegradation, and cross the placenta thus exposing the foetus prenatally and, through nursing, postnatally the suckling baby, as well. PCBs are neurotoxic, particularly in a developmental context, but there is still controversy as to whether there is risk for adverse neurodevelopmental outcome at current environmental PCB-levels. In order to clarify this issue and in order to increase the statistical power for the detection of subtle effects an European coordinated cohort study was initiated covering rural, marine and urban environments in Denmark (Faroe Islands), the Netherlands (Groningen, Rotterdam) and Germany (Dusseldorf). Individual study reports have been published (Patandin et al., 1999; Steuerwald et al., 2000; Walkowiak et al., 2001), but results from the combined data set at 42 months of age have not yet been presented. Methods:Healthy mother-infant pairs were recruited from local hospitals in Rotter-dam/Groningen (N = 418), the Faroe Islands (N = 182) and Dusseldorf (N = 171). 3 or 4 marker congeners were measured in maternal and/or cordblood, and in mother's milk taken at two weeks. At 42 months of age physical (height, weight, head circumference), neurological (Neurological Optimality according to Touwen), and mental development (Kaufman Achievement Battery for Children =K-ABC; Dutch and German Cohort only) were measured following a uniform protocol, and analysed for associations with neonatal PCB-exposure by means of multiple linear regression modelling. Results:As for physical development no significant associations were found with neonatal PCB-exposure, but with postnatal PCBs in 42 months serum (t= -1.45; p < 0.1 for head circumference, t = -2.46; p < 0.01 for height and t = 4.17, p < 0.001 for weight). No significant nor borderline associations were found for neurological development. As for mental development significant negative associations were found for K-ABC simultaneous processing (t = -2.24; p < 0.01) for PCBs in cordblood and borderline ones for postnatal intake, as well (t = -1.78; p < 0.10), but not for the sequential or composite scales. Conclusions:As for physical development these data are primarily compatible with an interpretation in terms of growth-related PCB-dilution, although a negative impact of postnatal PCB-intake on growth cannot be fully excluded. As for mental development the findings are generally in line with previous reports emphasizing the importance of prenatal PCB-exposure for neurodevelopmental adversity.", "label": 0}

{"id": "1856", "title": "Rethinking the Significance of Reovirus in Water and Wastewater", "abstract": "The genus Orthoreovirus contains nonenveloped viruses with double-stranded gene segments encased in a double-layered icosahedral capsid shell. These features constitute major determinants of virion stability in the environment and virion resistance against physical and chemical agents. Reovirus (ReoV) is the general term most commonly used for all virus strains that infect humans and nonhuman animals. Several studies have demonstrated the frequent occurrence of ReoV in wastewaters and natural waters, including surface and ground waters from different geographical areas. Most of these studies have reported higher concentrations of ReoV than any other enteric virus analyzed. They are more commonly isolated in chlorine-disinfected wastewaters than other enteric viruses, and appear to survive longer in water. The ability of ReoV to form large aggregates, even with different types of enteric viruses (e.g., poliovirus) and their ability to undergo mechanisms of gene segment reassortment among different serotypes may also explain their greater stability. Different approaches have been applied for concentration of ReoV from water; however, the recovery efficiency of the filtration methods has not been fully evaluated. Recently, molecular methods for identification of ReoV strains and quantification of virus genome have been developed. Studies have shown that the overall detection sensitivity of ReoV RNA is enhanced through initial replication of infectious virions in cell culture. More studies are needed to specifically address unresolved issues about the fate and distribution of ReoV in the environment since this virus is not commonly included in virological investigations.", "label": 0}

Here we provide a functional mapping of olfactory\u2013gustatory responses to stimulation of the human insular cortex. Methods: We reviewed 651 electrical stimulations of the insula that were performed in 221 patients, using stereotactically implanted depth electrodes, during the presurgical evaluation of drug-refractory epilepsy. Results: Gustatory sensations were evoked in 15 (2.7%) of the 550 stimulations that elicited a clinical response. They were exclusively obtained after stimulation of a relatively delimited zone of insula, located in its mid-dorsal part (posterior short gyrus). Six olfactory sensations (1.1%) could be obtained during stimulations of an insular region that partially overlapped with the gustatory representation. Interpretation: Our study provides a functional mapping of gustatory representation in the insular posterior short gyrus and the first detailed description of olfactory sensations obtained by direct stimulation of mid-dorsal insula. Our data also show a spatial overlap between gustatory, olfactory, and oral somatosensory representation in the mid-dorsal insula, and suggest that this part of the insula may be an integrated oral sensory region that plays a key role in flavor perception. It also indicates that dysfunction in this region should be considered during the evaluation of gustatory and olfactory epileptic seizures. Ann Neurol 2017;82:360\u2013370.", "label": 0}

Herein, the antimicrobial potency of the EWNS was further enhanced by integrating electrolysis, electrospray and ionization of de-ionized water in the EWNS synthesis process. Detailed physicochemical characterization of these enhanced EWNS (eEWNS) was performed using state-of-the-art analytical methods and has shown that, while both size and charge remain similar to the EWNS (mean diameter of 13\u00a0nm and charge of 13 electrons), they possess a three times higher ROS content. The increase of the ROS content as a result of the addition of the electrolysis step before electrospray and ionization led to an increased antimicrobial ability as verified by E.\u00a0coli inactivation studies using stainless steel coupons. It was shown that a 45-min exposure to eEWNS resulted in a 4-log reduction as opposed to a 1.9-log reduction when exposed to EWNS. In addition, the eEWNS were assessed for their potency to inactivate natural microbiota (total viable and yeast and mold counts), as well as, inoculated E.\u00a0coli on the surface of fresh organic blackberries. The results showed a 97% (1.5-log) inactivation of the total viable count, a 99% (2-log) reduction in the yeast and mold count and a 2.5-log reduction of the inoculated E.\u00a0coli after 45\u00a0min of exposure, without any visual changes to the fruit. This enhanced antimicrobial activity further underpins the EWNS platform as an effective, dry and chemical free approach suitable for a variety of food safety applications and could be ideal for delicate fresh produce that cannot withstand the classical, wet disinfection treatments.", "label": 0}

Uninoculated radish seeds and seeds inoculated with Escherichia coli O157: H7 were treated with water, Ca(OCl)2 (free chlorine concentrations of 50 or 200 ?g/ml), or C1O2 (50 or 200 ?g/ml) for 5 min and subsequently dried at 25\u00b0C for up to 24 h. Populations of total aerobic bacteria (TAB), molds and yeasts (MY), and E. coli O157: H7 on the seeds treated with Ca(OCl)2 were not significantly different (P = 0.05) than populations on seeds treated with C1O2 at the same concentrations. However, populations of microorganisms on seeds treated with C1O2 decreased more rapidly during drying. Treatment with C1O2 (200 ?g/ml) followed by drying caused reductions in TAB, MY, and E. coli 0157: H7 of 3.1, 2.0, and 3.8 log CFU/g, respectively.

Aim To assess whether containment of symptomatic patients in single rooms and bays at the beginning and end of norovirus outbreaks reduced the length of bed closure. Methods In 2007, we introduced a new strategy to limit the operational impact of hospital outbreaks of norovirus. Early in an outbreak, symptomatic patients were cohorted in single rooms or bays in an attempt to contain the outbreak without closing the entire ward. Once a ward had been closed, and as beds became available through discharges, patients were decanted into single rooms or empty bays with doors to facilitate earlier cleaning and opening of affected areas on the same ward. The impact of these changes was assessed by comparing outbreak data for two periods before and after implementation of the new strategy. Findings Prior to June 2007, 90% of outbreaks were managed by closure of an entire ward, compared with only 54% from June 2007 onwards. The duration of closure was significantly shorter for bays compared with entire wards, both before (3.5 vs 6, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0327) and after (3 vs 5, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001) June 2007. When considering all outbreaks, there was a significant reduction in duration of closure after the change in strategy (6 vs 5, P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Conclusion Using ward compartmentalization to cohort affected patients at the beginning and end of norovirus outbreaks improved the efficiency of outbreak management and reduced operational disruption.", "label": 0}

The study was undertaken in three stages: firstly, review of the laboratory studies published in the literature; secondly, development of a conceptual approach to apply the laboratory studies to full-scale conditions; and finally implementation of the calculations for a hypothetical case study system. The developed model explicitly accounted for variability in residence time and pathogen specific chlorine sensitivity. Survival functions were constructed for a range of pathogens relying on the upper bound of the reported data transformed to a common metric. The application of the model within a hypothetical case study demonstrated the importance of accounting for variable residence time in QMRA. While the overall Log10 reduction may appear high, small parcels of water with short residence time can compromise the overall performance of the barrier. While theoretically simple, the approach presented is of great value for undertaking an initial assessment of a full-scale disinfection contactor based on limited site-specific information.", "label": 1}

In this context, development of controlled delivery systems for slow and sustained release of agrochemicals or genetic materials is crucial. Chitosan has emerged as a valuable carrier for controlled delivery of agrochemicals and genetic materials because of its proven biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, and adsorption abilities. The major advantages of encapsulating agrochemicals and genetic material in a chitosan matrix include its ability to function as a protective reservoir for the active ingredients, protecting the ingredients from the surrounding environment while they are in the chitosan domain, and then controlling their release, allowing them to serve as efficient gene delivery systems for plant transformation or controlled release of pesticides. Despite the great progress in the use of chitosan in the area of medical and pharmaceutical sciences, there is still a wide knowledge gap regarding the potential application of chitosan for encapsulation of active ingredients in agriculture.

Due to the lack of reliable surface water and ground-water, rainwater harvesting has played a prominent role in farmers\u2019 domestic usage and agricultural irrigation. An economical and valid type of water storage cistern with optimum design of components has been introduced to rural areas in the Loess Plateau. Different collection alternatives showed apparent variations in rainwater quality. By using different catchments, such as mortar roofs and cement-paved courtyards, compacted land or road surfaces, rainwater can be effectively collected for storage in cisterns. This study focused mainly on the quality of rainwater harvested from the different catchment systems and stored for different periods of time. By analysis of the water samples stored in these cisterns, it was evident that rainwater quality could be improved significantly by self-purification during the storage. With emphasis on rainwater quality affected by the different catchment systems, it was found that the measured inorganic compounds in the rainwater harvested from roof-yard catchment systems generally matched the WHO standards for drinking water, while the concentrations of some inorganic compounds in the rainwater collected from land and road surfaces appeared to be higher than the guideline values for drinking water, but generally not beyond the maximum permissible concentrations. However, Fecal Coliform, which is an important bacteriological parameter for the three catchment systems, exceeded the limits of drinking water to a greater extend. Trace amounts of 55 organic pollutants were identified, including aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds and phthalate esters, etc. The analytical results indicated that roof-yard catchments that included the \u201cfirst flush\u201d usually provided safe drinking water with low organic contents, even for rainwater collected immediately after rainfall.

The relationship between fractional BZR occupancy, as assessed by inhibition of [3H]flumazenil binding, and potentiation of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx into membrane vesicles of rat cerebral cortex was evaluated for four ligands under identical experimental conditions. Triazolam and the quinolizinone Ro 19-8022 potentiated the effect of GABA maximally by nearly 50%, diazepam by about 40% and bretazenil by approximately 20%. Potentiation of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- flux by 25% was observed at about 35% BZR occupancy for diazepam, about 45% for triazolam and about 95% for Ro 19-8022. Bretazenil did not produce 25% potentiation even at receptor saturation. Although the curves relating fractional BZR occupancy to GABA potentiation were hyperbolic and nearly superimposable for triazolam and diazepam, those for Ro 19-8022 and bretazenil displayed parabolic characteristics by inducing an effect only at very high BZR occupancy, reflecting the partial agonistic profile of the latter two compounds.

However, little is known about which handwashing protocol is most efficacious. We evaluated six handwashing protocols (soap and water, alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS), and 0.05% sodium dichloroisocyanurate, high-test hypochlorite, and stabilized and non-stabilized sodium hypochlorite solutions) for 1) efficacy of handwashing on the removal and inactivation of non-pathogenic model organisms and, 2) persistence of organisms in rinse water. Model organisms E. coli and bacteriophage Phi6 were used to evaluate handwashing with and without organic load added to simulate bodily fluids. Hands were inoculated with test organisms, washed, and rinsed using a glove juice method to retrieve remaining organisms. Impact was estimated by comparing the log reduction in organisms after handwashing to the log reduction without handwashing. Rinse water was collected to test for persistence of organisms. Handwashing resulted in a 1.94-3.01 log reduction in E. coli concentration without, and 2.18-3.34 with, soil load; and a 2.44-3.06 log reduction in Phi6 without, and 2.71-3.69 with, soil load. HTH performed most consistently well, with significantly greater log reductions than other handwashing protocols in three models. However, the magnitude of handwashing efficacy differences was small, suggesting protocols are similarly efficacious. Rinse water demonstrated a 0.28-4.77 log reduction in remaining E. coli without, and 0.21-4.49 with, soil load and a 1.26-2.02 log reduction in Phi6 without, and 1.30-2.20 with, soil load. Chlorine resulted in significantly less persistence of E. coli in both conditions and Phi6 without soil load in rinse water (p<0.001).

Of 191 isolates identified as staphylococci, ten showed a resistance to benzalkonium chloride equivalent to that reported for clinical isolates in a standard test for minimum inhibitory concentration. In some cases resistance seemed to be associated with the ability to resist accumulation of ethidium bromide and results indicate that these properties might be carried on a 2\u20133 kbase plasmid. There was no evidence of linkage to antibiotic resistance. Serial subculturing of both resistant and sensitive strains in sublethal concentrations of benzalkonium chloride led to increased resistance in both minimum inhibitory concentration and standard suspension tests.", "label": 0}

{"id": "893", "title": "The microbiological quality of seven large commercial private water supplies in the United Kingdom", "abstract": "Some 1% of the UK population derives their potable water from 140,000 private water supplies (PWSs) regulated by Local Authorities. The overwhelming majority of these are very small domestic supplies serving a single property or a small number of properties. Treatment for such supplies is rudimentary or non-existent and their microbiological quality has been shown to be poor in every published study to date. Private water supplies serving commercial enterprises such as hotels, restaurants, food production premises and factories are more frequently treated and subject to closer regulation in the United Kingdom. As a result, it has been assumed that these larger commercial supplies are less likely to experience elevated faecal indicator and pathogen concentrations at the consumer tap which have been observed at small domestic supplies. This paper reports on intensive monitoring at seven commercial private water supplies (six of which were treated) spread throughout the UK serving hotels, holiday parks and food production enterprises. Daily sampling of 'potable' water, both at the consumer tap and using large volume filtration for Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. was conducted over two six week periods in the spring and autumn of 2000. This allowed the effects of short term episodic peaks in faecal indicator and pathogen concentration to be quantified. All the supplies experienced intermittent pathogen presence and only one, a chlorinated deep borehole supply, fully complied with UK water quality regulations during both periods of sampling. Poor microbiological water quality typically followed periods of heavy rainfall. This suggests that the design and installation of such systems should be undertaken only after the likely range of raw water quality has been characterised, which requires a thorough understanding of the effects of flow and seasonality on raw water quality. There is no reason to suspect that the monitored sites are uncharacteristic of other commercial supplies and the results reinforce public health concerns related to domestic supplies. Furthermore, the pattern of contamination is highly episodic, commonly lasting only a few days. Thus, the relatively infrequent regulatory monitoring of such supplies would be unlikely to identify the poor water quality episodes and does not provide the data necessary for public health protection. Although some statistical relationship was found between faecal indicator organisms and the presence of pathogens, the use of FIOs in assessments of regulatory compliance may not always provide a reliable measure of public health risk, i.e. indicator absence does not preclude pathogen presence. The results of this study suggest that a risk assessment system similar to the WHO 'Water Safety Planning' approach might offer a more appropriate regulatory paradigm for private water supplies. \u00a9 IWA Publishing 2007.", "label": 1}

Should a large scale bioterrorism incident occur in which consumer food products were contaminated with a pathogenic sporeformer such as Bacillus anthracis, there may be a need to decontaminate these products before disposal as liquid or solid waste. Studies were conducted to test the efficacy of commercial household products for inactivating spores of Bacillus cereus (used as a surrogate for B. anthracis) in vitro and in fluid milk. Validation of the resistance of the B. cereus spores was confirmed with B. anthracis spores. Fifteen commercial products, designed as either disinfectants or sanitizers or as potential sanitizers, were purchased from retail markets. Products selected had one of the following active compounds: NaOCl, HCl, H2O2, acetic acid, quaternary ammonium compounds, ammonium hydroxide, citric acid, isopropanol, NaOH, or pine oil. Compounds were diluted in water (in vitro) or in 2% fat fluid milk, and spores were exposed for up to 6 h. Products containing hypochlorite were most effective against B. cereus spores. Products containing HCl or H2O2 also reduced significant numbers of spores but at a slower rate. The resistance of spores of surrogate B. cereus strains to chlorine-containing compounds was similar to that of B. anthracis spores. Therefore, several household products on the market may be used to decontaminate fluid milk or similar food products contaminated by spores of B. anthracis.", "label": 0}

RESULTS: The sequential chlorination was more efficient in inactivating these microorganisms than free chlorination, indicating that synergy was provided by free chlorine and monochloramine. Ammonia addition time, temperature and pH had influences on this synergy. CONCLUSIONS: The possible mechanism of this synergy might involve three aspects: free chlorine causing sublethal injury to microorganisms and monochloramine further inactivating them; different ability of free chlorine and monochloramine to penetrate and inactivate microorganism congeries; and higher concentration of residual chlorine in sequential chlorination than in free chlorination.", "label": 1}

{"id": "4561", "title": "Involvement of humic substances in regrowth", "abstract": "There appear to be interactions in the distribution system that complicate the ability to use AOC/BDOC as an independent assessment of regrowth potential. Two such complications are the limitation of the assays themselves and the potential interaction between the organic carbon concentration with the presence of disinfectants and pipe materials. To address these interactions, a series of experiments spanning several years have been conducted in model distribution systems at the Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE) using soil-derived humics. When compared to easily utilized organics, humic substances supported the same order of magnitude of biofilm organisms. As carbon concentration was increased from 500 to 1000 to 2000 ppb, there was no increase in growth rate of the organisms, suggesting zero-order kinetics. If the system was chlorinated, there was less biomass, but growth rates were higher. In the presence of corrosion products, humic-fed systems supported more organisms than a control system fed biologically treated water. When free chlorine was maintained at a residual of about 0.2 mg/l, biofilm numbers on the surfaces were reduced. Phosphate alone did not result in fewer bacteria, while a combination of chorine and phosphate had the best results (lowest biofilm numbers). Adjustment to pH 9 was not effective. Recently completed work compared increasing levels of humic substances in the presence of free chlorine and monochloramine on biofilm growth on a number of surfaces (PVC, epoxy, cement, ductile iron). As the concentration of humic substances was increased from 0, 0.5 to 2 mg/l, there was an increase in biofilm numbers on all surfaces. This effect was the most pronounced on iron surfaces. These results illustrate that carbon compounds not measured by the BDOC or AOC tests may profoundly influence biofilm numbers. In addition, iron surfaces are at much higher risk for elevated biofilm counts in the presence of humic substances, even if disinfection is practiced. However, corrosion control may mitigate this interaction.[on SciFinder (R)]", "label": 0}

Apart from being a candidate for commercial cultivation, P. perna is also a common pest organism in cooling water systems of coastal power stations. Therefore, a lethal and sublethal response of this mussel to commonly used antifouling biocides is of considerable interest to the industry. Mortality pattern (LT(50) and LT(100)) and physiological activities (oxygen consumption, filtration rate, foot activity index, and byssus thread production) of different size groups (9-34 mm shell lengths) of P. perna were studied in the laboratory under different residual chlorine concentrations (0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 mg/L for sublethal responses and 1, 2, 3, and 5 mg/L for mortality). Results showed that exposure time for 100% mortality of mussels significantly decreased with increasing residual chlorine concentration. For example, mussels of 9 mm size group exposed to 1 mg/L chlorine residual took 384 h (16 days) to reach 100% mortality, whereas those exposed to 5 mg/L chlorine took 84 h (4 days). The effect of mussel size on mortality was significant between 1 mg/L and 5 mg/L residual chlorine, with larger mussels showing greater resistance than smaller ones. For example, at 2 mg/L residual chlorine, 9 mm and 34 mm size group mussels took 228 h (10 days) and 304 h (13 days), respectively, to achieve 100% mortality. All size groups of P. perna showed progressive reduction in physiological activities, when chlorine residuals were gradually increased from 0 to 1 mg/L. Reduction in physiological activities was strongly correlated with the residual level. A comparison of present data with data available for other common fouling organisms suggests that P. perna is relatively less tolerant to chlorine than Perna viridis (L.) and Brachidontes striatulus (Hanley), which also cause fouling problems in tropical coastal waters.", "label": 0}

Legionella pneumophila grown in water cultures in association with other microorganisms were less sensitive to disinfection by chlorine and iodine than were agar-passaged cultures. Differences in sensitivity to disinfection between water-cultured and agar-grown legionellae were determined by comparing C x T values (concentration in milligrams per litre multiplied by time in minutes to achieve 99% decrease in viability) and CM x T values (concentration in molarity). Iodine (1500x) gave a greater difference in CM x T values than did chlorine (68x). Iodine was 50 times more effective than chlorine when used with agar-grown cultures but was only twice as effective when tested against water-grown Legionella cultures. C x T x S values (C x T multiplied by percent survivors), which take into consideration the percent surviving bacteria, were used to compare sensitivities in very resistant populations, such as those in biofilms. Water cultures of legionellae associated with stainless-steel surfaces were 135 times more resistant to iodination than were unattached legionellae, and they were 210,000 times more resistant than were agar-grown cultures.

Previous work has demonstrated the bactericidal effectiveness of PAA and monochloramine in wastewater, but limited information is available for viruses, especially ones of mammalian origin (e.g., norovirus). Therefore, a comparative assessment was performed of the virucidal efficacy of PAA and monochloramine against murine norovirus (MNV) and MS2 bacteriophage in secondary effluent MWW and phosphate buffer (PB). A suite of inactivation kinetic models was fit to the viral inactivation data. Predicted concentration time (CT) values for 1-log(10) MS2 reduction by PAA and monochloramine in MWW were 1254 and 1228 mg-min/L, respectively.

The two viability methods produced significantly different results (P < 0.05). Products of disinfectant concentration and contact time (Ct values) of 1,000 mg. min/liter were needed to inactivate approximately 0.5 log(10) and 2.0 log(10) units (99% inactivation) of C. parvum as measured by in vitro excystation and cell infectivity, respectively, suggesting that excystation is not an adequate viability assay. Purified oocysts originating from three different suppliers were evaluated and showed marked differences with respect to their resistance to inactivation when using chlorine dioxide. Ct values of 75, 550, and 1,000 mg. min/liter were required to achieve approximately 2.0 log(10) units of inactivation with oocysts from different sources. Finally, the study compared the relationship between easily measured indicators, including Bacillus subtilis (aerobic) spores and Clostridium sporogenes (anaerobic) spores, and C. parvum oocysts. The bacterial spores were found to be more sensitive to chlorine dioxide than C. parvum oocysts and therefore could not be used as direct indicators of C. parvum inactivation for this disinfectant. In conclusion, it is suggested that future studies address issues such as oocyst purification protocols and the genetic diversity of C. parvum, since these factors might affect oocyst disinfection sensitivity.", "label": 0}

State-of-the-art quality control measures involve phytochemical fingerprinting of the triterpene glycosides for species identification and chemical standardization by HPLC. In the course of developing materials and methods for standardization procedures, the major C. racemosa triterpene glycoside (1) was isolated and initially thought to be cimicifugoside (2). Detailed HR-LC-MS and 1D and 2D NMR analysis of 1 and 2 unambiguously revealed that 1 is the chlorine-containing derivative of 2, namely, 25-chlorodeoxycimigenol-3-O-beta-d-xyloside. Accordingly, HPLC profiles of black cohosh preparations require revision of the assignments of the chlorinated (1) and nonchlorinated (2) pair. Besides explaining the substantial shift in polarity (Delta t(R)[RP-18] ca. 20 min), 25-deoxychlorination opens a new pathway of structural diversification in triterpene glycoside chemistry. As chemical conversion of 2 into 1 could be demonstrated, deoxychlorination may be interpreted as artifact formation. Simultaneously, however, it is a potentially significant pathway for the gastric in vivo conversion (\"nature's prodrug\") of the relatively polar triterpene glycosides into significantly less polar chlorinated derivatives with altered pharmacological properties.", "label": 0}

Various primary disinfectants can deactivate NDMA precursors prior to chloramination. However, they promote the formation of other byproducts. This study compared the reduction in NDMA formation due to chlorine, ozone, chlorine dioxide, and UV over oxidant exposures relevant to Giardia control coupled with postchloramination under conditions relevant to drinking water practice. Ten waters impacted by treated wastewater, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (polyDADMAC) polymer, or anion exchange resin were examined. Ozone reduced NDMA formation by 50% at exposures as low as 0.4 mgxmin/L. A similar reduction in NDMA formation by chlorination required approximately 60 mgxmin/L exposure. However, for some waters, chlorination actually increased NDMA formation at lower exposures. Chlorine dioxide typically had limited efficacy regarding NDMA precursor destruction; moreover, it increased NDMA formation in some cases. UV decreased NDMA formation by approximately 30% at fluences >500 mJ/cm(2), levels relevant to advanced oxidation. For the selected pretreatment oxidant exposures, concentrations of regulated trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, bromate, and chlorite typically remained below current regulatory levels. Chloropicrin and trichloroacetaldehyde formation were increased by preozonation or medium pressure UV followed by postchloramination. Among preoxidants, ozone achieved the greatest reduction in NDMA formation at the lowest oxidant exposure associated with each disinfectant. Accordingly, preozonation may inhibit NDMA formation with minimal risk of promotion of other byproducts. Bromide >500 mug/L generally increased NDMA formation during chloramination. Higher temperatures increased NDMA precursor destruction by preoxidants but also increased NDMA formation during postchloramination. The net effect of these opposing trends on NDMA formation was water-specific.", "label": 0}
{"id": "771", "title": "Physiological methods to study biofilm disinfection", "abstract": "This report reviews the development of a rapid in situ approach to study the physiological responses of bacteria within biofilms to disinfectants. One method utilized direct viable counts (DVC) to assess the disinfection efficacy when thin biofilms were exposed to chlorine or monochloramine. Results obtained using the DVC method were one log higher than plate count (PC) estimates of the surviving population after disinfection. Other methods incorporated the use of fluorogenic stains, a cryotomy technique to yield thin (5-?m) sections of biofilm communities and examination by fluorescence microscopy. The fluorogenic stains used in this approach included 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC), which indicates cellular electron transport activity and Rhodamine 123, which responds specifically to proton motive force. The use of these stains allowed the microscopic discrimination of physiologically active bacteria as well as heterogeneities of active cells within thicker biofilms. The results of experiments using these techniques with pure culture and binary population biofilms on stainless steel coupons indicated biocidal activity of chlorine-based disinfectants occurred initially at the bulk-fluid interface of the communities and progressed toward the substratum. This approach provided a unique opportunity to describe the spatial response of bacteria within biofilms to antimicrobial agents and address mechanisms explaining their comparative resistance to disinfection in a way that has not been possible using traditional approaches. Results obtained using this alternative approach were also consistently higher than RC data following disinfection. These observations suggest that traditional methods involving biofilm removal and bacterial enumeration by colony formation overestimate biocide efficacy. Hence the alternative approach described here more accurately indicates the ability of bacteria surviving disinfection to recover and grow as well as demonstrate spatial heterogeneities in cellular physiological activities within biofilms.", "label": 0}

Acute local tolerability (as assessed by the incidence of cough and mean forced expiratory volume after 1 s inhalation) was similar for both BDP and placebo formulated in either chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) or HFA propellants. A total of 43 patients were treated with HFA-BDP (0, 200, 400 or 800 ?g day?1) or CFC-BDP (800 ?g day?1) for 14 days and their 24 h urinary free cortisol (UFC) excretion and response to cosyntropin stimulation were measured. There was no difference in UFC between any of the doses of HFA-BDP and CFC-BDP. Adrenal responsiveness to cosyntropin stimulation was normal in all but one patient. Two large 12 week phase III trials compared HFA-placebo, HFA-BDP 400 ?g day?1 and CFC-BDP 800 ?g day?1 (n = 347), and HFA-BDP 800 ?g day?1 and CFC-BDP 1500 ?g day?1 (n = 233). For HFA-BDP at either dose, CFC-BDP 800 ?g day?1 and HFA-placebo, the number of patients with morning plasma cortisol concentrations below normal was less than 4\u00b74% but was 14\u00b76% for CFC-BDP 1500 ?g day?1. The incidence of adverse events was lower in the HFA-BDP groups than in the CFC-BDP groups (P = 0.012). The data indicate that, at doses of up to 800 ?g day?1, HFA-BDP is at least as well tolerated as CFC-BDP. Other studies have found that equivalent efficacy is reached at lower doses of HFA-BDP than CFC-BDP.

Although a specific defect in muscle metabolism has not been clearly defined, yet several studies report altered oxidative metabolism. In this study, we detected oxidative damage to DNA and lipids in muscle specimens of CFS patients as compared to age-matched controls, as well as increased activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and transferase, and increases in total glutathione plasma levels. From these results we hypothesize that in CFS there is oxidative stress in muscle, which results in an increase in antioxidant defenses. Furthermore, in muscle membranes, fluidity and fatty acid composition are significantly different in specimens from CFS patients as compared to controls and to patients suffering from fibromyalgia. These data support an organic origin of CFS, in which muscle suffers oxidative damage.", "label": 0}

In this study, treating samples with the sanitizing agents resulted in reductions in both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents. These reductions generally increased with increasing the agent concentration. Chlorophyll a was found to be more sensitive than chlorophyll b to oxidation reactions with the agents used. Chlorophyll reductions of samples treated with ozone were at the higher level than samples treated by using other agents. Since the differences between chlorophylls contents of the samples treated with chlorine and hydrogen peroxide are very small, hydrogen peroxide can be suggested as an alternative to chlorine for sanitizing chard (P<0.05).", "label": 0}

The bactericidal activity of EW against biofilms was hardly any affected by any variations in the pH of prodn. Neutral EW (NEW) was therefore used in subsequent studies as it has a higher potential for long-term application than acidic EW (due to a lower corrosiveness and toxicity) and due to the higher yield rate of the prodn. unit at neutral pH. The application of NEW caused a high redn. in the no. of viable biofilm cells initially. However, a high available chlorine concn. (800 mg/L) was needed to achieve logarithmic redns. (LR) demanded by the European quant. surface test of bactericidal activity (? 4 log CFU/cm2 after 5 min). A double sequential application of NEW at much lower concns. for 5 min each allowed LR ? 4 log CFU/cm2 to be reached in most of the exptl. range. Sequential applications of NEW and either benzalkonium chloride or peracetic acid (PAA) showed a similar effect, with PAA-NEW being most effective. The combination of NEW with other antimicrobial treatments can thus be an environmentally friendly alternative to disinfection protocols traditionally used in the food industry. Practical Applications : Spain is the largest producer and the second largest consumer of seafood in the European Union, thus ensuring the safety of these products is of outmost importance. However, a high incidence of Staphylococcus aureus was recently found in fishery products marketed in Spain, which questioned the efficacy of disinfectants traditionally applied in the food industry. This study focused on electrolyzed water (EW) because it is an environmentally friendly, safe-to-use and relatively inexpensive option.

Exptl. results showed that hydrophilic polymers in root media assisted P. popularis plants to tolerate the drought and salt stresses, due to the following reasons: (1) roots took up the retained water from hydrophilic polymers when water was deficient in the soil (Stockosorb-treated plants exhibited a higher rate of water uptake); (2) under saline conditions, Stockosorb and Luquasorb held Na+ and Cl- in the soil soln. due to their high water-holding capacity, thus limiting an excessive accumulation of toxic ions in the plant organs; furthermore, the exchangeable K+ that contained in Stockosorb and Luquasorb resulted in an improved K+/Na+ homeostasis in salinized plants; (3) hydrophilic polymers aided the plants to tolerate an interactive impacts of drought and salt stresses, which was mainly accounted for their water- and salt-holding capacities. In comparison, the growth and survival enhancement effects of the hydrophilic polymers on Drought + NaCl-treated plants was more evident by Luquasorb application, because it supplied water to plants at a lower rate during soil drying, thus prolonging the duration of water supply and allowed roots to grow in an environment of lower salinity for a long period of salt and drought stresses.

Exposure of isolated hepatocytes to 1,1,1-trichloroethane or tetrachloroethylene resulted in suppression of uptake of taurocholate, ouabain, and 2-aminoisobutyric acid but not CdCl2 or 3-O-methyl-d-glucose. The effect was clearly evident at noncytotoxic concentrations, as indicated by the lack of intracellular enzyme leakage and unaltered intracellular K+ ion concentration. Moreover, the ultrastructure of solvent-exposed hepatocytes was similar to that of control cells, except for a reduction in membrane microvilli. The suppression of uptake was reversible provided that sufficient time was allowed for the cells to recover. The mechanism of this inhibition may be associated with energy-linked processes, as uptake of taurocholate, ouabain, and 2-aminoisobutyric acid is energy requiring while uptake of CdCl2 and 3-O-methyl-d-glucose is not. Cellular ATP was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, but a marked depletion occurred only at cytotoxic concentrations. Na+-K+- and Mg2+-ATPase activities in hepatocyte plasma membrane preparations were also inhibited by solvent exposure. The data suggest that 1,1,1-trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene interfere specifically with energy-dependent hepatic transport functions and that a decrease in ATP levels and/or inhibition of cell membrane ATPases may be the mechanism.", "label": 0}

The optimum conditions for treating fresh-cut coriander with chlorine dioxide were concentration of 60 mg/L, time of 10 min and solution to fresh-cut product ratio of 8:1. This process decreased the total number of aerobic bacterial colonies to 2.1 lg cfu/g. Seven bacterial strains were identified through 16S rDNA sequence analysis and morphological observation. The potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Brevibacterium, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter, as well as other bacteria were effectively decreased by chlorine dioxide treatment. Therefore, treating fresh-cut coriander with chlorine dioxide under appropriate conditions during processing or storage can both effectively reduce the food safety risk. These results provide a valuable theoretical basis for improving the safety of fresh-cut products. Practical applicationsThis is the first study that identifies the microbial genera on fresh-cut coriander, providing evidence for the need of commercial sterilization. The results of this study can be applied to industrial production and provide references for postharvest quality handlings of other fresh-cut vegetables and fruits.", "label": 0}
{"id": "2001", "title": "Inefficacy of osmotic backwash induced by sodium chloride salt solution in controlling SWRO membrane fouling", "abstract": "A study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of osmotic backwash induced by high salt (NaCl) concn. soln. on feed side of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes, online and offline, in controlling membrane fouling and therefore minimizing/eliminating the need for chem. cleaning. SWRO membranes were deliberately fouled by feeding seawater from an open intake located on the Arabian Gulf Coast without dosing chems. The fouled membranes were subjected to offline cleaning with the salt soln. of up to 25 % concn. Despite the partial removal of foulants from the membrane surface, SWRO membrane performance could not be restored, indicating the ineffectiveness of osmotic backwash in aiding offline salt cleaning. Similarly, online osmotic backwash was found to be not only ineffective in removing foulants from membrane surfaces but actually increased the fouling rate, as indicated by faster fouling rates compared to other cases. Although the driving force required for the osmotic backwash existed, the generated back flow proved to be insufficient to detach foulants from membrane surfaces. During the study period, the av. SWRO membrane flux was maintained between 19 and 23 LMH, whereas the av. generated back flow flux by high salt concn. soln. was only 11 LMH, which was not adequate to remove foulants from membrane surfaces. Moreover, it seems that the membrane configuration as well as inherent microstructure of SWRO membrane places certain constraints on the osmotic backwash process and renders osmotic backwash ineffective in tackling SWRO membrane fouling. Hence, chem. cleaning is essential to restore SWRO membrane performance whenever fouling occurs, and the use of highly concd. salt soln. does not have any significant benefit. Membrane autopsy revealed only an insignificant accumulation of biofouling layer despite the absence of disinfection. However, it was shown that culturable biofilm bacteria species isolated from membranes tolerated exposure to high salt concns. at pH range of 7-8. In addn., the overall findings of the study indicate that SWRO membranes can be operated in Gulf seawater at a recovery of 30 % without using any chems., such as coagulant, disinfectant and antiscalant, for an acceptable period of time without performing membrane cleaning. This is highly likely, if media filters are used in the pretreatment and SWRO membranes are operated at normal flux and recovery ratio. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

In this study, we developed two approaches using UV/Cl2: one to quantitate the OH* radicals based on the degradation of the probe compound para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) and the other to use bacteriophage MS2 to understand the virus inactivation mechanisms in response to UV, chlorine and UV/Cl2 disinfection using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), attachment and genome penetration assays. The results revealed that OH* radicals were produced at a concentration of 2.70 x 10(-14) M in the UV/Cl2 treatment with a practical chlorine dose of 1 mg/L and with a minimum UV254 fluence of approximately 10 mJ/cm(2), whereas UV or chlorine alone did not produce OH* radicals. In the UV/Cl2 treatment, synergistic effects on viral genome damage were observed, but were not directly due to OH* radicals. The ability of MS2 to penetrate the genome of the host bacteria was impaired, but its ability to attach to the host was not affected by the treatment. We concluded that the major cause of virus inactivation in response to UV/Cl2 was the damage to the viral genome caused by combination actions of chlorine species and OH* radicals.", "label": 1}
{"id": "3717", "title": "Prediction of Reduction Potential Changes in Rubredoxin: A Molecular Mechanics Approach", "abstract": "Predicting the effects of mutation on the reduction potential of proteins is crucial in understanding how reduction potentials are modulated by the protein environment. Previously, we proposed that an alanine vs. a valine at residue 44 leads to a 50-mV difference in reduction potential found in homologous rubredoxins because of a shift in the polar backbone relative to the iron site due to the different side-chain sizes. Here, the aim is to determine the effects of mutations to glycine, isoleucine, and leucine at residue 44 on the structure and reduction potential of rubredoxin, and if the effects are proportional to side-chain size. Crystal structure analysis, molecular mechanics simulations, and experimental reduction potentials of wild-type and mutant Clostridium pasteurianum rubredoxin, along with sequence analysis of homologous rubredoxins, indicate that the backbone position relative to the redox site as well as solvent penetration near the redox site are both structural determinants of the reduction potential, although not proportionally to side-chain size. Thus, protein interactions are too complex to be predicted by simple relationships, indicating the utility of molecular mechanics methods in understanding them.", "label": 0}

Salmonella was generally more pressure-resistant than E. coli O157:H7 on clover and radish seeds except on broccoli seeds where the trend was reversed. In addition, the application of HHP differentially affected seeds' germinability and the order of pressure tolerance of the seeds was such that red clover &gt; crimson clover ? broccoli &gt; radish seeds with final germination percentages ranging from 85\u2013100% while their untreated counterparts had final germination percentages of 99\u2013100%.

Moreover, the ability of HHP-treated seeds to germinate also varied as a function of the pre-soaking duration and the seed type. Pre-soaking radish and broccoli seeds for 30 min prior to HHP (2 or 5 min) resulted in germination percentages of ? 1% after 8 days of incubation. On the contrary, red clover seeds displayed higher germination potential when pre-soaked for 60 min at 20 \u00b0C prior to HPP (5 min) with final germination percentages of 94%, although their yield was substantially lower than their untreated counterparts. Red clover seeds pre-soaked for 60 min at 4 \u00b0C followed by HPP at 600 MPa for 5 min at 20 \u00b0C produced germination percentages of 91 and 95% after 3 and 8 days of sprouting compared to 99 and 100% respectively for untreated seeds. In addition, this condition did not significantly (P &gt; 0.05) reduce the sprout yield.

Currently, greater attention has been paid to side effects occurring during PEF treatment and the influences on food qualities and food components. The present study investigated the electrochemical reaction and oxidation of lecithin under PEF processing. Results showed that electrochemical reaction of NaCl solutions at different pH values occurred during PEF processing. Active chlorine, reactive oxygen, and free radicals were detected, which were related to the PEF parameters and pH values of the solution. Lecithin extracted from yolk was further selected to investigate the oxidation of food lipids under PEF processing, confirming the occurrence of oxidation of lecithin under PEP treatment. The oxidative agents induced by PEF might be responsible for the oxidation of extracted yolk lecithin. Moreover, this study found that vitamin C as a natural antioxidant could effectively quench free radicals and inhibit the oxidation of lipid in NaCl and lecithin solutions as model systems under PEP processing, representing a way to minimize the impact of PEP treatment on food qualities.", "label": 0}

The gene targets addressed for the ssDNA based inhibition method were marA (multiple antibiotic resistance) and groL (essential gene Hsp60) in E. coli. Based on the maximum log reduction in E. coli cell numbers when compared to no ssDNA control, groL-1 was chosen as the optimized ssDNA for gene silencing-based inactivation. For toxicity assessment, HepG2 cells were exposed to extracts corresponding to concentrations of 0.2, 1, 5, 25 and 50 mL water/mL medium of chlorine doped water and 1, 10, 100, 300 nM of ssDNA. Compared with ssDNA, HepG2 cells exposed to extracts of chlorine doped water for 24 h showed higher cytotoxicity, caspase 3/7 levels, DNA damage, micronuclei frequency, and decreased cell viability. Water doped with chlorine was found to be more toxic than that by ssDNA when exposed to HepG2 cells.

All of the quinolone-resistant strains tested were found to be DNA gyrase mutants. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the quinolones for these DNA gyrases roughly correlated with their MICs. Interestingly, gyrase inhibition by DU-6859a was found to be significantly less affected by these mutations that inhibition by other currently available quinolones. To assess the enhanced activity shown by DU-6859a, the effects of quinolones with altered substituents at the N-1, C-7, and C-8 positions of the quinolone ring of DU-6859a were tested. Measurement of MICs for four DNA gyrase mutants and IC50s for their purified DNA gyrases showed that removal of the C-8 chlorine of DU-6859a significantly increased MICs and IC50s for DNA gyrase mutants. However, no deleterious effects were observed when either the fluorine on the cyclopropyl substituent at the N-1 position or the cyclopropyl ring at the C-7 substituent was removed. Moreover, removal of the C-8 chlorine also increased the MIC for 19 of 20 quinolone-resistant clinical isolates. Our results led to the conclusion that DU-6859a is much more active against quinolone-resistant clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa than other currently available quinolones, probably because of its strong inhibitory effects against mutant quinolone-resistant DNA gyrases, and that the C-8 chlorine is necessary for these potent effects.", "label": 0}

Disinfection rates, chlorine generation, energy demand, and generation of disinfection by-products were monitored over the 190-day study. Particular attention was given to the generation of trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) during the electrochemical treatment cycle. In addition, the potential for generation of THMs and HAAs during post-treatment storage of the water was assessed. The electrochemical treatment system resulted in a 2- to 3-log removal of total heterotrophic bacteria, with values below detection (<1 CFU/mL) often observed. Disinfection occurred with only very low levels of observed chlorine generation (<0.1 mg/L), suggesting that alternate disinfection mechanisms likely played a significant role in the observed removal of bacteria. THM and HAA concentrations after treatment were consistently well below regulatory levels. Results also showed that electrochemical treatment significantly reduced the formation of bromoform when the water received subsequent exposure to hypochlorite. Removal of naturally occurring bromide in the water by the electrochemical system may have been the cause (in part) for this observed mitigation of bromoform formation. The formation of calcium scale on the cathode surface over time was the primary operational challenge.", "label": 0}

Spectrofluorometric observations of purified nucleic acids, ribosomes and the microscopic color of bacteriophage-infected cells stained with AO confirmed the theory that single-stranded nucleic acids emit orange to red fluorescence while those that are double-stranded fluoresce green in vivo. Bacteria growing actively in a rich medium could be distinguished from cells in stationary phase by the AO reaction. Cells from log phase appeared red, whereas those in stationary phase were green. However, this differentiation was not seen when the bacteria were grown in a minimal medium or when a variation of the staining method was used. Also, shifting bacteria in stationary phase to starvation conditions rapidly changed their AO staining reaction. Boiling and exposure to lethal concentrations of azide and formalin resulted in stationary-phase cells that appeared red after staining but bacteria killed with chlorine remained green. These findings indicate that the AO staining reaction may be suggestive of physiological activity under defined conditions. However, variables in staining and fixation procedures as well as uncertainties associated with mixed bacterial populations in environmental samples may produce results that are not consistent with the classical interpretation of this reaction. The importance of validating the putative physiological implications of this staining reaction is stressed.", "label": 0}

We report the experience of a university hospital, where a water safety plan has been applied since 2002, and the results obtained with the application of different methods for disinfecting hot water distribution systems in order to provide guidance for the management of water risk. INTERVENTIONS: The disinfection procedures included continuous chlorination with chlorine dioxide (0.4-0.6 mg/L in recirculation loops) reinforced by endpoint filtration in critical areas and a water treatment based on monochloramine (2-3 mg/L). Real-time polymerase chain reaction and a new immunoseparation and adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence analysis were applied in environmental monitoring. RESULTS: After 9 years, the integrated disinfection-filtration strategy significantly reduced positive sites by 55% and the mean count by 78% (P < .05); however, the high costs and the occurrence of a chlorine-tolerant clone belonging to Legionella pneumophila ST269 prompted us to test a new disinfectant. The shift to monochloramine allowed us to eliminate planktonic Legionella and did not require additional endpoint filtration; however, nontuberculous mycobacteria were isolated more frequently as long as the monochloramine concentration was 2 mg/L; their cultivability was never regained by increasing the concentration up to 3 mg/L.

Performance data for approved sanitizers that reflect commercial systems are needed to set standards for audit compliance. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) for water disinfection as an objective assessment of recent industry-adopted standards for dump tank and flume management in fresh tomato packing operations. On-site assessments were conducted during eight temporally distinct shifts in two Florida packinghouses and one California packinghouse. Microbiological analyses of incoming and washed fruit and dump and flume system water were evaluated. Water temperature, pH, turbidity, conductivity, and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) were monitored. Reduction in populations of mesophilic and coliform bacteria on fruit was not significant, and populations were significantly higher (P < 0.05) after washing. Escherichia coli was near the limit of detection in dump tanks but consistently below the detection limit in flumes. Turbidity and conductivity increased with loads of incoming tomatoes. Water temperature varied during daily operations, but pH and ORP mostly remained constant. The industry standard positive temperature differential of 5.5 degrees C between water and fruit pulp was not maintained in tanks during the full daily operation. ORP values were significantly higher in the flume than in the dump tank. A positive correlation was found between ORP and temperature, and negative correlations were found between ORP and turbidity, total mesophilic bacteria, and coliforms. This study provides in-plant data indicating that ClO(2) can be an effective sanitizer in flume and spray-wash systems, but current operational limitations restrict its performance in dump tanks. Under current conditions, ClO(2) alone is unlikely to allow the fresh tomato industry to meet its microbiological quality goals under typical commercial conditions.", "label": 0}

The CFD model was also used to evaluate disinfection efficiency in alternative reactor designs. The CFD reactor analysis demonstrates that disinfection efficiency is affected by both kinetics and mixing state (i.e., degree of micromixing or segregation).

The system is part of a water reclamation facility for effluent reuse in golf course and agricultural irrigation. Influent and effluent samples were taken over two sampling periods (three consecutive days in July and one day in August), with three different UV doses applied each day (ranging from 10 to 40 mW.s/cm2 and 20 to 80 mW.s/cm2 in July and August, respectively). Effluent samples were also taken from a chlorine disinfection channel (5 mg Cl2/L dose) operating in parallel to the UV system. Total coliforms (TC), faecal coliforms (FC), faecal streptoccoci (FS) and somatic coliphages (SC) were measured in each sample. F-specific RNA bacteriophages and bacteriophages of Bacteroides fragilis were also measured one day in July. The decay ratio observed for all the microorganisms was similar when UV doses applied were low (July), ranging from 1.15 to 1.25 log-units. This suggests that bacterial indicators may be suitable for virus inactivation control when low UV doses are applied; however, such low doses are inadequate to achieve effluent quality requirements for unrestricted irrigation. At higher UV doses (August), decay ratios for TC and FC were 3.1 and 2.8 log-units respectively, indicating that they were more susceptible to UV exposure than SC and FS, with decay ratios of 2.6 and 1.0 log-units, respectively. Nevertheless, these higher doses were also inadequate to achieve water quality requirements for unrestricted irrigation. The decay ratio of SC during chlorine disinfection was clearly lower than that of the other microorganisms. Bacteriophages of Bacteroides fragilis were more resistant to UV disinfection than SC and F-specific RNA. In fact, bacteriophages of Bacteroides fragilis were not affected during UV exposure. A UV dose ranging from 40 to 80 mW.s/cm2 marks the borderline beyond which inactivation rates of SC are clearly lower than those of bacterial indicators.", "label": 1}

Here, a highly virulent strain of P. syringae pv. actinidiae, NZ V-13, was studied with respect to biofilm formation and architecture using a flow cell system combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy. The biofilm formed by P. syringae pv. actinidiae NZ V-13 was heterogeneous, consisting of a thin cellular base layer 5 mu m thick and microcolonies with irregular structures. The major component of the EPSs produced by P. syringae pv. actinidiae NZ V-13 bacteria was isolated and identified to be an exopolysaccharide. Extensive compositional and structural analysis showed that rhamnose, fucose, and glucose were the major constituents, present at a ratio of 5:1.5:2. Experimental evidence that P. syringae pv. actinidiae NZ V-13 produces two polysaccharides, a branched alpha-D-rhamnan with side chains of terminal alpha-D-Fucf and an alpha-D-1,4-linked glucan, was obtained.

The awareness of the presence of viruses on food emphasized the need to acquire knowledge regarding the effect of preservation methods upon viruses. Most foodborne viruses cannot be cultured in the laboratory, which hinders studies of their stability in food. Cultivable surrogate viruses, genetically related to the human infecting strains, are taken as a substitute to define inactivation rates. The last years, the number of survival and inactivation studies using various surrogate viruses increased. In this review, state-of-the-art information regarding the efficacy of preservation methods to reduce the level of viruses on food is compiled. In the first place, the effect of preservation methods establishing microbial growth inhibition (chilling, freezing, acidification, reduced water activity and modified atmosphere packaging) upon foodborne viruses is described. Secondly, the use of preservation methods establishing microbial inactivation such as heat treatment, high hydrostatic pressure processing and irradiation to eliminate viruses is discussed. In the third place, the efficacy of decontamination methods on fresh produce and purification procedures applied on live bivalve shellfish to reduce the viral load is included. These studies indicate that viruses persist well on chilled, acidified, frozen foods and foods packed under modified atmosphere or in dried conditions. Intervention strategies inducing microbial inactivation are required to achieve a 3 log reduction of the level of viruses. Decontamination of fresh produce reduces viruses with a maximum of 1 to 2 log while purification of live bivalves is not adequate to prevent viral outbreaks.

These two wheat cultivars are not genetically related as evident from randomized polymorphic DNA anal. (random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)) which revealed 28 % genetic diversity. Salinity stress caused a marked redn. in grain yield of both wheat cultivars. However, cv. S-24 was superior to cv. MH-97 in maintaining grain yield under saline stress. Furthermore, salinity caused a significant variation in different physiol. attributes measured at different growth stages. Salt stress caused considerable redn. in different water relation attributes of wheat plants. A significant redn. in leaf water, osmotic, and turgor potentials was recorded in both wheat cultivars at different growth stages. Maximal redn. in leaf water potential was recorded at the reproductive stage in both wheat cultivars. In contrast, maximal turgor potential was obsd. at the boot stage. Salt-induced adverse effects of salinity on different water relation attributes were more prominent in cv. MH-97 as compared to those in cv. S-24. Salt stress caused a substantial decrease in glycine betaine and alpha tocopherols. These biochem. attributes exhibited significant salt-induced variation at different growth stages in both wheat cultivars. For example, maximal accumulation of glycine betaine was evident at the early growth stages (vegetative and boot). However, cv. S-24 showed higher accumulation of this org. osmolyte, and this could be the reason for maintenance of higher turgor than that of cv. MH-97 under stress conditions. Salt stress significantly increased the endogenous levels of toxic ions (Na+ and Cl-) and decreased essential cations (K+ and Ca2+) in both wheat cultivars at different growth stages. Furthermore, K+/Na+ and Ca2+/Na+ ratios decreased markedly due to salt stress in both wheat cultivars at different growth stages, and this salt-induced redn. was more prominent in cv. MH-97. Moreover, higher K+/Na+ and Ca2+/Na+ ratios were recorded at early growth stages in both wheat cultivars. It can be inferred from the results that wheat plants are more prone to adverse effects of salinity stress at early growth stages than that at the reproductive stage. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

Cats have thus been proposed as a valuable translational model of T2D. In humans, inflammation assocd. with adipose tissue is believed to be central to T2D development, and peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) are important in the inflammatory cascade which leads to insulin resistance and ?-cell failure. PBM may thus provide a useful window to study the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus in cats, however feline monocytes are poorly characterized. In this study, we used the Affymetrix Feline 1.0ST array to profile peripheral blood monocytes from 3 domestic cats with T2D and 3 cats with normal glucose tolerance. Feline monocytes were enriched for genes expressed in human monocytes, and, despite heterogeneous gene expression, we identified a T2D-assocd. expression signature assocd. with cell cycle perturbations, DNA repair and the unfolded protein response, oxidative phosphorylation and inflammatory responses. Our data provide novel insights into the feline monocyte transcriptome, and support the hypothesis that inflammatory monocytes contribute to T2D pathogenesis in cats as well as in humans.

In humans, these viruses spread via person-to-person contact, food, water, and/or the environment. Their survival and inactivation on hard surfaces have been extensively studied; however, nonlaunderable soft surfaces, such as upholstery and carpet, have received little attention. The aim of this systematic review was to determine factors that influence the survival and inactivation of enteric viruses on nonlaunderable soft surfaces. METHODS: EBSCO and Web of Science were searched for experimental studies published between 1965 and 2015 using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methods. Titles and abstracts were screened using 3 eligibility criteria. The quality of all study methods was also assessed. RESULTS: Our search yielded 12 articles. Viruses survived between 0 hours and 140 days depending on surface and environment conditions. Virus survival was influenced by temperature, relative humidity, organic content, and deposition method. A variety of chemistries were tested across studies and were shown to have a varied effect on enteric viruses. Chlorine, glutaraldehyde, vaporous ozone, and hydrogen peroxide were the most efficacious against enteric viruses (> 3-log reduction). CONCLUSIONS: Environmental factors, such as temperature and relative humidity, can influence survival of enteric viruses on nonlaunderable soft surfaces. The efficacy of liquid and vaporous chemistries are associated with surface and virus type.", "label": 1}

Sugraone) under variable conditions of salinity to evaluate whether mortality is a consequence of the processes causing growth and transpiration loss or whether it is an independent process coupled with ion toxicity. Six irrigation water salinity levels (electrical conductivity of irrigation water from 0.5 to 12 dS m(-1) chlorine concentration from 3.8 to 149 m(-1)) were applied in a one-year lysimeter study and four salinity levels (1.8 to 9.0 dS m(-1); 10 to 75 mM chlorine) were applied for five years in vineyard conditions. In the lysimeter experiment, salinity-reduced transpiration was measured as early as 30 days after budburst, and biomass production and evapotranspiration were found to be linearly related. In both the lysimeter and field trials, mortality was dynamically associated with salinity level and time and corresponded to extreme accumulation of sodium and chlorine in shoots. Grapevine response to salinity involved two mechanisms: (1) a reduction in transpiration and growth, which began as soon as salinity was experienced; and (2) vine mortality, which was correlated with salinity level, a sharp increase in sodium and chlorine content of leaves, and time. At lower salinities, the onset of mortality occurred later and death rates increased as the duration of exposure to salinity increased.", "label": 0}

In the present study, three media (mCP, TSCF and CP Chromo Select Agar) were evaluated for recovery of C. perfringens in different surface water samples. Out of 139 water samples, using a membrane filtration technique, 131 samples (94.2%) were found to be presumptively positive for C. perfringens in at least one of the culture media. Green colored colonies on CP Chromo Select Agar (CCP agar) were counted as presumptive C. perfringens isolates. Out of 483 green colonies on CCP agar, 96.3% (465 strains, indole negative) were identified as C. perfringens, and 15 strains (3.1%) were indole positive and were identified as Clostridium sordellii, Clostridium bifermentans or Clostridium tetani. Only 3 strains (0.6%) gave false positive results and were identified as Clostridium fallax, Clostridium botulinum, and Clostridium tertium. Variance analysis of the data obtained shows statistically no significant differences in the counts obtained between media employed in this work. The mCP method is very onerous for routine screening and bacterial colonies could not be used for further biochemical testing. The colonies on CCP and TSCF were easy to count and subculture for confirmation tests. TSCF detects sulfite-reducing clostridia, including species other than C. perfringens, and in some cases excessive blackening of the agar frustrated counting of the colonies. If the contamination was too high, TSCF did not consistently produce black colonies and as a consequence, the colonies were white and gave false negative results. On the other hand, the identification of typical and atypical colonies isolated from all media demonstrated that CCP agar was the most useful medium for C. perfringens recovery in water samples.", "label": 0}

Methods and Results : The OWRS performance in reducing microbial contaminants was detd. by assessing three different faecal indicators (Escherichia coli, F-specific coliphages and Clostridium perfringens for measuring the disinfection efficiency of bacteria, viruses and spore-formers and surrogate for protozoa, resp.) using culture-based methods. Quant. PCR was used to quantify pathogenic bacteria (Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), Campylobacter spp., and Arcobacter spp.), a human-assocd. faecal marker (gyrB), and tetracycline resistant bacteria (tetQ). The levels of E. coli, coliphages and Cl. perfringens showed 5\u00b74, 2\u00b73, 2\u00b75 log redn., resp., upon disinfection. In the final effluents, coliphages (1\u00b77 \u00d7 102 PFU 100 mL-1) and Cl. perfringens (3\u00b74 CFU 100 mL-1) were detected in 80 and 100% of the samples, but E. coli was not found. The removal and inactivation of E. coli and Cl. perfringens were not significantly different across the seasons, however, efficacy of removal and inactivation of F-specific coliphage was significantly reduced during the winter/spring season compared to the summer/autumn season (P = 0\u00b7009). The redn. of Arcobacter,gyrB and tetQ by 3\u00b71, 2\u00b73 and 2\u00b73 log, resp., was mostly due to peat biofiltration under the study conditions. Conclusions : This study demonstrated that peat biofiltration was the most important step of the OWRS to remove microbes and genes from wastewater before spray irrigation of the effluents. The irrigation system is not suitable for edible crops because of the potential presence of residual pathogens. Significance and Impact of the Study : On-site wastewater treatment systems are a practical option for reusing the wastewater for landscape, esp. for those areas where geol. and seasonal limitations impact the removal of microbial contaminants by soil infiltration.

Our aim was to assess water quality and health implications in a Mexico City periurban agricultural area. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A longitudinal study in the Xochimilco wetland area was conducted, and 42 sites were randomly selected from 211, including irrigation water canals and effluents of treatment plants. Sample collection took place during rainy and dry seasons (2000-2001). Microbiological parameters (total coliforms, fecal coliforms, streptococci/enterococci, and bacteria other than Vibrio grown on TCBS), Helicobacter pylori, and physicochemical parameters including trihalomethanes (THM) were determined. Fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci are appropriate indicators of human or animal fecal contamination. Fecal coliform counts surpass Mexican and World Health Organization irrigation water guidelines. Identified microorganisms associated with various pathologies in humans and domestic animals comprise Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Salmonella spp., Enterobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., and Pseudomonas spp; H. pylori was also present in the water. An environmental characteristic of the canal system showed high Total Organic Carbon content and relatively low dissolved oxygen concentration; residual chlorine as a disinfection control is not efficient, but THMs do not represent a problem. During the rainy season, temperature and conductivity were higher; in contrast, pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, and residual chlorine were lower. This is related with the continuous load of feces from human and animal sources, and to the aquatic systems, which vary seasonally and exhibit evidence of lower water quality in effluents from treatment plants.

In a preliminary study, turkey eggs were hatched in a germ-free environment. Firmicutes 16S rRNA gene was detected in the cecal microbiota of hatched poults, suggesting that poults may acquire spore-formers by exposure to shell contents during hatching. Generating gnotobiotic poults for research requires elimination of bacteria from the egg's surface without damaging the developing embryo. The ability of different disinfectants and antiseptics to eliminate eggshell bacteria without harming the developing embryo was tested. Different classes of disinfectants and antiseptics (halogens, biguanidines, and oxidants) were selected to target spores and vegetative bacteria likely present on the egg's surface. Eggs were treated by fully immersing in heated antiseptic (betadine or chlorhexidine) or disinfectant (alkaline bleach, acidified bleach, chlorine dioxide, Oxysept-333, or Virkon S) solutions for up to 15 minutes. Shells were aseptically harvested for aerobic and anaerobic culturing of bacteria. Toxicity to the developing embryo was assessed by gross evaluation of developmental changes in treated eggs incubated up to 27 d of embryonation. Halogen disinfectants acidified bleach and chlorine dioxide, and oxidants Oxysept-333 and Virkon-S eliminated viable bacteria from eggshells. However, addition of oxidants, alone or in combination with other treatments, produced significant (P < 0.05) embryotoxicity. The combination treatment of acidified bleach, chlorine dioxide, and betadine produced minimal embryotoxicity and eliminated viable bacteria from whole turkey eggs, and produced hatched poults in a gnotobiotic isolator. As a control, eggs were treated with PBS, incubated, and hatched under germ-replete conditions. After hatching, poults were euthanized and treated poults had no detectable bacterial growth or 16S rRNA gene qPCR amplification, demonstrating that acidified sodium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, and betadine safely hatched gnotobiotic poults.

A broad search was conducted in two electronic databases. Each citation was appraised using screening tools designed and tested a priori. Level 1 relevance screening excluded irrelevant citations; level 2 confirmed relevance and categorized. Data were then extracted, and intervention categories were descriptively summarized. Meta-analysis was performed to provide a summary estimate of treatment effect where two or more studies investigated the same intervention in comparable populations. The Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the confidence in the estimated summary measures of intervention effect for each data subgroup. Data were also extracted from the control groups of 25 challenge trials captured by the review, to fit logistic regression models of Salmonella infection in pigs, using odds of infection as the outcome measure. The only intervention captured by the review which was significantly associated with reduced risk of Salmonella in field settings, was elimination of lairage, which is not currently feasible commercially. The logistic regression model for fecal Salmonella shedding in pigs with a random intercept for trial yielded the following predictors significantly associated with increased odds of infection: oral challenge route relative to intra-nasal, log increase in challenge dose, and elapsed time post-challenge. Univariable exact logistic regression modeling lymph node contamination post-challenge yielded the following predictors significantly associated with increased odds of Salmonella infection: younger animals relative to older ones; intra-nasal challenge route relative to oral route; and animals sampled within the first 7 days post-challenge relative to those sampled at 14 or 21 days.

Two halogenated furanones 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (MX) and mucochloric acid (MCA) were analyzed; along with trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), and absorbable org. halides (AOX). NOM was quantified using liq. chromatog.-org. carbon detection (LC-OCD). Measured MX and MCA formation was 6.9-15.3 ng/L and 43.2-315 ng/L following optimized coagulation and subsequent chlorination of the three waters tested. DBP formation and speciation were evaluated as a function of the specific NOM fractions present in the source waters. Humics, building blocks, and biopolymers were highly correlated with DBP formation. Correlations between DBPs were also investigated and a potential relationship between MCA and/or MX vs. HAAs was obsd. MX was the only measured DBP that contributed to genotoxicity, representing less than 0.001% of AOX by mass but responsible for 40-67% of the genotoxic response in chlorinated Ottawa River water samples. Genotoxic potential decreased with alum dosages, signifying that coagulation was effective at removing genotoxic DBP precursors. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

At low initial dosage (0.05 mg Cl2 l-1) neither cultivability (colony-forming units (cfu)), nor enzyme activity of E. coli suspensions were severely impaired. When initial chlorine concentration was increased to 0.1 mg Cl2 l-1, the cfu number decreased whereas enzyme activity remained high, i.e. the enzyme activity calculated cfu-1 increased. At higher chlorine doses both cfu and enzyme activity were reduced, but non-cultivable cells retained assayable activity after chlorination. Mean values of the enzyme activity calculated cfu-1 decreased when the chlorine dosage was increased from 0.1 to 0.5 mg Cl2 l-1, but were not significantly different (P > 0.05) for dosages of 0.2-0.7 mg Cl2 l-1. After chlorination, beta-D-galactosidase activity of E. coli was less reduced than cfu and direct viable count numbers, but more reduced than 5-cyano-2-3, ditolyl tetrazolium chloride and total cell counts, and the enzyme activity represented an alternative activity parameter of chlorinated samples.", "label": 1}

We measured Escherichia coli counts in municipal source water and, within households, water from principal storage containers, stored boiled drinking water, and water in a serving cup. Source water was microbiologically clean, but 26 (28%) of 93 samples of water stored for cooking had fecal contamination. Twenty-seven (30%) of 91 stored boiled drinking water samples grew E. coli. Boiled water was more frequently contaminated when served in a drinking cup than when stored (P < 0.01). Post-source contamination increased successively through the steps of usage from source water to the point of consumption. Boiling failed to ensure safe drinking water at the point of consumption because of easily contaminated containers and poor domestic hygiene.

Even though only a very small portion of these organisms can survive the rough condition of ballast tanks, these survivors pose a big threat to the new environment they are introduced into. There are numerous proposed ballast water treatment techniques for eliminating diverse effects of ballast water translocation. Chlorine disinfection is one of the proposed chemical techniques for ballast water treatment. A lab-scale chlorine generation system for disinfecting ballast water organisms was used for testing and electrochemical cell design was proposed in our previous studies as well in this current study for artificial neural network applications. This study covers some of these experimental measurements and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) applications as a non-linear statistical data modeling and a decision making tool. In this study, two different electrochemical cell types are tested to determine the properties of the disinfectant produced under various conditions. These cells are designed to produce chlorine directly from seawater and to be used onboard for ballast water disinfection. Two ANN models are utilized to find relationship between operational conditions and disinfectant quality parameters, i.e., total residual chlorine (TRC) and free available chlorine (FAC). The results which are presented with the ANN tool showed a very good correlation between input parameters and experimental results.", "label": 1}

Mustard flour was mixed at 5%, 10% or 20% (w/w) with freshly ground beef, then the beef was inoculated with a cocktail of five strains of E. coli O157:H7 at either 3, 6 or ?1.6 log10 cfu/g. The ground beef was formed into 100 g patties and each was placed in a bag of Nylon/EVOH/PE, which was back-flushed with 100% N2, heat-sealed and stored at 4 \u00b0C for ?21 days. During storage, the allyl isothiocyanate (AIT) levels in package headspaces were determined by gas liquid chromatography. By 21 days, the levels present in treatments were not significantly different. After 21 days storage, there were 0.5, 3 and 5.4 log10 decreases in numbers of E. coli O157:H7 from the initial levels of 6 log10 cfu/g in meat containing 5%, 10% and 20% mustard flour, respectively. When inoculated at 3 log10 cfu/g, E. coli O157:H7 was reduced to undetectable levels after 18, 12 and 3 days with 5%, 10% and 20% mustard flour, respectively. When immunomagnetic separation (IMS) was used for E. coli recovery following its inoculation at ?1.6 log10 cfu/g, 5% mustard did not completely eliminate the pathogen from ground beef stored for 6 days. The natural microflora of the ground beef which developed in vacuum packages was unaffected by the addition of 5% mustard flour but some inhibition was found at higher concentrations. Sensory evaluation of the cooked ground beef showed that there were no significant differences in the acceptability of meat treated with 5 or 10% mustard flour. However, panelists could distinguish untreated controls from mustard treatments, but considered the mustard-treated meat to be acceptable. These results showed that it is possible to use mustard flour at levels of &gt;5\u201310% to eliminate E. coli O157:H7 from fresh ground beef.", "label": 0}

Our overall research focus has been to understand the interaction of factors affecting bacterial attachment and biofilm formation with the ultimate goal of devising strategies to control this problem. This paper briefly describes three areas of biofilm research in which we have been involved. Listeria monocytogenes, a foodborne pathogen, survived for prolonged periods on stainless steel and buna-n rubber, materials commonly used in food-processing equipment. Survival was affected by temperature, relative humidity, attachment surface, and soil. Some components in the rubber inhibited growth of the organism on buna-n, which also affected the efficacy of sanitizers on biofilm inactivation. In cheese manufacture, biofilms of Lactobacillus curvatus could lead to a defect caused by the formation of calcium lactate crystals in Cheddar cheese. This hardy organism persisted in low numbers on equipment surfaces and was difficult to eradicate. We investigated the relative contributions and interactions of mechanical, thermal, and chemical processes in an air-injected clean-in-place method for milking systems. Overall, it is important to study the interactions between bacteria and the surfaces in a specific food processing environment to provide more effective measures for prevention of biofilm formation and for its removal.", "label": 0}

METHODS AND RESULTS: Bench-scale disinfection experiments used wastewater (sterilized by gamma-irradiation) seeded with laboratory-cultured organisms. Seeded primary effluent was treated with different doses of applied free chlorine (8, 16 and 30 mg l(-1)). FCV and E. coli were easily inactivated by >4 log10, within 5 min with a dose of 30 mg l(-1) of applied chlorine. Poliovirus was more resistant and a reduction of 2.85 log10 was seen after 30 min, MS2 was the most resistant organism (1 log10 inactivation). In further experiments seeded secondary effluent was treated with different doses of u.v. irradiation. To achieve a 4-log10 reduction of E. coli, FCV, poliovirus and MS2 doses of 5.32, 19.04, 27.51 and 62.50 mW s cm(-2), respectively, were required. CONCLUSIONS: Feline calicivirus and E. coli seeded in primary wastewater were very susceptible to chlorination compared with poliovirus and MS2. In contrast, FCV seeded in secondary wastewater was more resistant to u.v. irradiation than E. coli but more sensitive than poliovirus and MS2. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: FRNA phage was more resistant to inactivation than all the viruses tested. This suggests FRNA phage would be a useful and conservative indicator of virus inactivation following disinfection of wastewaters with chlorination or u.v. irradiation.", "label": 1}

Cryptosporidium parvum infects a wide range of host species including man and his livestock animals. The epidemiology is complex with both direct and indirect routes of transmission. Environmental contamination may result in dissemination of the infection by the water route. Such water may meet current microbiological and other standards.

Treatment of seeds containing 10(2) to 10(3) CFU/g in 100-micrograms/ml active chlorine solution for 5 or 10 min caused a significant (P < or = 0.05) reduction in population, and treatment in 290-micrograms/ml chlorine solution resulted in a significant reduction compared with treatment in 100 micrograms of chlorine per ml. However, concentrations of chlorine of up to 1,010 micrograms/ml failed to result in further significant reductions. Treatment of seeds containing 10(1) to 10(2) CFU of S. stanley per g for 5 min in a solution containing 2,040 micrograms of chlorine per ml reduced the population to undetectable levels (< 1 CFU/g). Treatment of seeds in water for 5 or 10 min at 54 degrees C caused a significant reduction in the S. stanley population, and treatment at > or = 57 degrees C reduced populations to < or = 1 CFU/g. However, treatment at > or = 54 degrees C for 10 min caused a substantial reduction in viability of the seeds. Treatment at 57 or 60 degrees C for 5 min appears to be effective in killing S. stanley without substantially decreasing germinability of seeds. Storage of seeds for 8 to 9 weeks at 8 and 21 degrees C resulted in reductions in populations of S. stanley of about 1 log10 and 2 log10 CFU/g, respectively. The behavior of S. stanley on seeds during soaking germination, sprouting, and refrigerated storage of sprouts was determined. An initial population of 3.29 log10 CFU/g increased slightly during 6 h of soaking, by about 10(3) CFU/g during a 24-h germination period, and by an additional 10 CFU/g during a 72-h sprouting stage. A population of 10(7) CFU/g of mature alfalfa sprouts was detected throughout a subsequent 10-day storage period at 5 degrees C. These studies indicate that while populations of S. stanley can be greatly reduced, elimination of this organism from alfalfa seeds may not be reliably achieved with traditional disinfection procedures. If S. stanley is present on seeds at the initiation of the sprout production process, populations exceeding 10(7) CFU/g can develop and survive on mature sprouts exposed to handling practices used in commercial production and marketing.", "label": 1}

A study was conducted to identify antimicrobial washes effective at reducing E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica from the surface of fresh whole strawberries during two-minute immersion washes. Twenty-seven antimicrobial treatments were tested. Vacuum perfusion was applied to strawberries during chlorine and peracetic acid treatments to promote infiltration of sanitizer into porous strawberry tissue. Strawberries were inoculated to 7.1logCFU/strawberry with a seven-strain bacterial composite, consisting of three strains of E. coli O157:H7 and four serovars of Salmonella enterica. Berries were air-dried for 2h and immersed in circulating antimicrobial solutions for 120s at 22 degrees C. Four treatments reduced >/=3.0logCFU/strawberry, including (a) 1% acetic acid+1% H2O2, (b) 30% ethanol+1% H2O2, (c) 90ppm peracetic acid, and (d) 1% lactic acid+1% H2O2.

For contagious pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, post-milking teat disinfection remains a simple, effective and economical practice for prevention of new intramammary infections (IMIs) of lactating dairy cows. Despite the universal acceptance of teat dipping as a method of mastitis control, variations in the susceptibility and resistance profile of mastitis pathogens among antiseptics have been described. Thus, here we sought to explore the in vitro efficacy of the followings antiseptics against S. aureus isolated from IMIs: chlorhexidine (2.0%), chlorine (2.5%), quarternary ammonium (4.0%), lactic acid (2.0%) and iodine (0.6%). We used 50 S. aureus strains isolated from bovine IMIs from 50 dairy herds located at Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul States (Brazil). The antiseptics were evaluated at four different specific intervals (15, 30, 60 and 300 s). We found a higher activity for quarternary ammonium and chlorhexidine against S. aureus at all time-points, followed by iodine and then chlorine. Lactic acid treatment produced the worst results for all time-points and strains. Due to variations in the sensitivity and resistance profile of antiseptics against S. aureus isolated from IMIs, the effectiveness of the antiseptics against the major mastitis pathogens should be periodically evaluated in dairy farms in an attempt to reduce the rate of new IMIs in the herd.", "label": 1}

This research, conducted in collaboration with the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) in California, compared the efficacy of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) to free chlorine (Cl2) with and without pre-treatment with low-pressure ultraviolet (UV) light for biofilm control. An additional goal was to determine disinfection by-product (DBP) formation with each disinfection strategy. Annular reactors (ARs) containing polycarbonate coupons were used to simulate EBMUD's 90-mile aqueduct that transports surface water from a source reservoir to treatment facilities. ARs were dosed with chemical disinfectants to achieve a residual of 0.2 mg/L, which is a typical value mid-way in the aqueduct. The experiment matrix included four strategies of disinfection including UV/ClO2, ClO2, UV/Cl2 and Cl2. Two ARs acted as controls and received raw water (RW) or UV-treated water. The data presented show that the UV/ClO2 combination was most effective against suspended and attached heterotrophic (heterotrophic plate count, HPC) bacteria with 3.93 log and 2.05 log reductions, respectively. ClO2 was more effective than Cl2 at removing suspended HPC bacteria and similarly effective in biofilm bacterial removal. UV light alone was not effective in controlling suspended or biofilm bacteria compared to treatment with ClO2 or Cl2. Pre-treatment with UV was more effective overall for removal of HPC bacteria than treating with corresponding chemical disinfectants only; however, it did not lower required chemical dosages. Therefore, no significant differences were observed in DBP concentrations between ARs pre-treated with UV light and ARs not pre-treated. Disinfection with ClO2 produced fewer total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) than chlorination but did produce low levels of chlorite. These data indicate that replacing Cl2 with ClO2 would further control microbiological re-growth and minimize TTHM and HAA formation, but may introduce other DBPs.[on SciFinder (R)]", "label": 1}

Salinity reduced leaf chlorophyll and plant transpiration rate (Ep) more in RL than SC. Confocal laser scanning analyses using the Na+-specific cell-permeant fluorescent probe CoroNa-Red revealed a higher capacity for Na+ sequestration in root tissue vacuoles of SC than in RL roots and that cell walls within the stele acted as Na+ traps.

Naturally contaminated Campylobacter-positive chicken carcasses, obtained from a commercial processing line immediately post-evisceration but prior to the inside-outside wash, were treated in a purpose-built automated spray rig. Replicated batch treatments for 15 and 30 s of chemical and water-only spray wash were performed. Untreated control carcasses were examined to provide baseline data for the initial numbers. Numbers of colony-forming units (CFU) per gram of skin excised from neck and breast locations were determined using selective agar media. For analysis, the results were subdivided into six microbe type/skin location combinations with each subdivision ranked by the following: (a) CFU remaining after treatment, (b) mean reductions and (c) the proportional change in numbers of samples below the limit of detection (LoD). The three groups of bacteria responded similarly to the chemicals applied. Campylobacter spp. were no more susceptible than the other two groups. No single chemical treatment gave the best effect across all ranking methods. Generally, ASC and TSP were more effective in reducing microbial counts than PAA, with CD and water having the least effect. A 30-s chemical treatment was usually more effective than a 15-s treatment. Where only a short (15 s) spray time is possible, ASC appears to be the most effective of the chemicals tested.

To reduce microbial contamination and maintain freshness, industrial processes in Portugal rely on minimally processing of vegetables with hypochlorite as sanitizer. Formation of toxic chlorine derivatives has raised concern restrictions to its use and alternatives with whey permeate as a disinfection agent has been attempted. The aim of this work was to evaluate the bin potential of fermented cheese whey, for use on disinfection of minimally processed lettuce organically grown. Assays were made with whey obtained from inoculated milk during cheese processing, fermented for 120 h at 37 degrees C, after which, among other carbohydrates, lactic acid was measured by HPLC, giving average yields of 18 g L-1. The sanitizing effect of whey, undiluted, 75 and 50% solutions, was compared with 110 ppm sodium hypochlorite, after rinsing. Aerobic Microorganisms (AM), Psychrotrophic Microorganisms (PM) and Enterobacteriaceae (ENT), were used as indicators for hygiene quality. For a level of significance of P < 0.05, the hygiene quality standards of lettuce samples, were better using 75% whey solution (AM 6.62, PM 7.48 cfu g(-1)), than using sodium hypochlorite (AM 7.48, PM 8.15 cfu g(-1)), for the 7 days of shelf life studied. Evaluation of Enterobacteriaceae showed significant differences after 3 days, between water (ENT 4.98 cfu g(-1)) sodium hypochlorite (ENT 4.81 cfu g-1) and 75% solution of whey (ENT 4.63 cfu g(-1)). Considering the actual limitations imposed to chlorine sanitation, these results point a good alternative to the food industry, especially for organic fresh vegetables, which are chemical free brands.

{"id": "3018", "title": "An outbreak of Cryptosporidium hominis infection at an Illinois recreational waterpark", "abstract": "Cryptosporidium has become increasingly recognized as a pathogen responsible for outbreaks of diarrhoeal illness in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised persons. In August 2001, an Illinois hospital reported a cryptosporidiosis cluster potentially linked to a local waterpark. There were 358 case-patients identified. We conducted community-based and waterpark-based case-control studies to examine potential sources of the outbreak. We collected stool specimens from ill persons and pool water samples for microscopy and molecular analysis. Laboratory-confirmed case-patients (n=77) were more likely to have attended the waterpark [odds ratio (OR) 16.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.8-66.8], had pool water in the mouth (OR 6.0, 95% CI 1.3-26.8), and swallowed pool water (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.5-13.3) than age-matched controls. Cryptosporidium was found in stool specimens and pool water samples. The chlorine resistance of oocysts, frequent swimming exposures, high bather densities, heavy usage by diaper-aged children, and increased recognition and reporting of outbreaks are likely to have contributed to the increasing trend in number of swimming pool-associated outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis. Recommendations for disease prevention include alteration of pool design to separate toddler pool filtration systems from other pools. Implementation of education programmes could reduce the risk of faecal contamination and disease transmission.", "label": 1}

For this study, epithelia were isolated in an Ussing-type chamber under short-circuit conditions. The effects of EBIO on the short-circuit current (I(sc)) and transepithelial resistance (R(t)) were measured under physiological conditions, as well as in experiments with altered electrolyte concentrations. Addition of 0.5 mM EBIO to the apical bath stimulated the control I(sc) by 64% and reduced R(t) by 21% (P < 0.05; paired data). Under Cl(-)-free conditions, I(sc) stimulation using EBIO was markedly attenuated. In the presence of an apical-to-basolateral K+ gradient and permeabilization of the apical membrane, the majority of the I(sc) reflected the transcellular movement of K+ via basolateral K+ channels. Under these conditions, EBIO in combination with A23187 elicited nearly instantaneous 60-90% increases in I(sc) that were sensitive to the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium and the K+ channel blocker tetraethyl ammonium. In the presence of an apical-to-basolateral Cl- gradient and nystatin permeabilization of the basolateral aspect, EBIO increased the Cl(-)-dependent I(sc), an effect prevented by the channel blocker glibenclamide (0.3 mM). The latter compound also was used to determine the proportion of EBIO-evoked unidirectional 36Cl- fluxes in the presence of the Cl- gradient that traversed the epithelium transcellularly. Overall, EBIO activated apical Cl- channels and basolateral K+ channels (presumably those that are Ca2+ dependent), thereby suggesting that this compound, or related derivatives, may be suitable as topical agents to stimulate fluid transport across the tissue in individuals with lacrimal gland deficiencies.", "label": 0}

A. acidoterrestris spores in aqueous suspension and on apple surfaces of four different cultivars were treated with several concentrations of chlorine dioxide. Spores in aqueous suspension treated with 40 ppm for 5 min were reduced by more than 4 log. Treatment with 80 ppm for 1 min and 120 ppm for 30 s resulted in about 1.8 log and 4.8 log reductions of spore viability, respectively, and treatment at 80 and 120 ppm for 5 min reduced spore viability to undetectable levels (&lt;0.7 log CFU/ml).

Methods We studied a number of ebselen analogs as inhibitors of B. anthracis thioredoxin reductase and their antibacterial activity on Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Results The most potent compounds in the series gave IC50 values down to 70 nM for the pure enzyme and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) down to 0.4 ?M (0.12 ?g/ml) for B. subtilis, 1.5 ?M (0.64 ?g/ml) for S. aureus, 2 ?M (0.86 ?g/ml) for B. cereus and 10 ?g/ml for M. tuberculosis. Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were found at 1\u20131.5 times the MIC, indicating a general, class-dependent, bactericidal mode of action. The combined bacteriological and enzymological data were used to construct a preliminary structure\u2013activity-relationship for the benzoisoselenazol class of compounds. When S. aureus and B. subtilis were exposed to ebselen, we were unable to isolate resistant mutants on both solid and in liquid medium suggesting a high resistance barrier. Conclusions These results suggest that ebselen and analogs thereof could be developed into a novel antibiotic class, useful for the treatment of infections caused by B. anthracis, S. aureus, M. tuberculosis and other clinically important bacteria. Furthermore, the high barrier against resistance development is encouraging for further drug development.

At this moment there is no scientific information available to estimate this risk accurately. Four strains (Listeria monocytogenes serovar 1/2a, Listeria manocytogenes serovar 4b, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis) were repeatedly exposed to increasing sub-inhibitory concentrations of decontaminants (trisodium phosphate, acidified sodium chlorite, citric acid, chlorine dioxide or peroxyacetic acid) and tested against 15 antibiotics by means of a standard disc-diffusion technique (NCCLS). The antibiotic resistance patterns of strains were compared before and after exposure to decontaminants. Intra-specific differences in antibiotic resistance patterns were found among strains. Increases in resistance to various antibiotics were observed in L monocytogenes and S. enterica strains after exposure to chemicals (especially ASC). These results raise concerns over the application of certain poultry decontaminants, since they could contribute to the development of microbial resistance mechanisms. However, these are preliminary results derived from laboratory-based experiments. Additional studies under practical field conditions would be needed to substantiate these findings.

The introduction examines the growing interest of this industry as the consumer demand for healthier and fresher food products is rising every year. The main spoilage changes that affect minimally fresh processed fruit and vegetables, as well as how the traditional processing and preservation techniques solve these problems, are reviewed. Also the need for seeking alternative or secondary technologies which use mild but reliable treatments in order to achieve fresh-like quality and safe products with a high nutritional value is considered. Additionally, the introduction focus on the keys for the production of safe foods, which include screening materials entering the food chain, suppressing microbial growth and reducing or eliminating the microbial load by processing and preventing post-processing contamination. Some successful combinations of subinhibitory processes, based on the application of a combination of various mild treatments, take advantage of the synergisms of the different preservation hurdles known as 'hurdle technology'. The success of the new technologies also depends on a good understanding of the physiological responses of microorganisms to stresses imposed during food preservation. The second part discusses the factors and processing operations that affect the quality of minimally fresh processed plant foods, which include good agricultural practices in growing crops, good hygienic practices during harvesting and handling, quality of washing water, processing technologies, packaging methods and transportation, processing and storage temperatures. Factors such as the quality of the raw material, worker sanitation in the processing plant, disinfection of the product, antibrowning dips, peeling and cutting steps and the packaging materials and conditions will play a very important role in the final quality of minimally fresh processed commodities. The last part of the chapter addresses the emerging technologies for keeping microbial and sensory quality of minimally fresh processed fruits, vegetables and juices, relating to disinfection of the products and other emerging techniques. Novel modified atmosphere packaging, hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet-C radiation, ozone, acidic electrolysed water, biocontrol cultures, organic acids, chlorine dioxide or hot water treatments have been examined. The two most relevant emerging techniques to be applied in minimally fresh processed juices, which are pulsed electric field and high hydrostatic pressure, are commented on and the current applications to particular food products are considered.", "label": 0}

CAT has stronger oxidative activity than NH(2)Cl, which is a smaller, more lipophilic molecule. The question arises whether lower oxidative activity can be compensated by higher lipophilicity. To address this problem, we investigated the bactericidal and fungicidal activity of pure NH(2)Cl compared to CAT. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, and Candida albicans were subjected to quantitative killing assays at 20 degrees C and pH 7.1 in equimolar solutions of CAT or NH2Cl. NH2Cl was superior to CAT against all test strains at all test concentrations. At a concentration of 0.036 mM, NH2Cl reduced the count of E. coli (S. aureus) by 3log10 within 1 min (5 min), whereas CAT needed 120 min (30 min) for the same effect. At 0.107 mM NH2Cl, a 3log10 reduction of P. aeruginosa was achieved after 5 min compared to 20 min using CAT. NH2Cl (0.355 mM) caused a 2log10 reduction of C. albicans within 30 s, whereas 60 min were necessary for the same reduction with 0.355 mM CAT. The difference between the antiseptics was even more pronounced when tested on aspergilli. NH2Cl had a significantly stronger bactericidal and fungicidal activity than CAT despite its lower oxidative activity. This phenomenon can be attributed to its lipophilicity and smaller bulk, and it should be taken into account when developing and using chloramine antiseptics.", "label": 0}

After the equivalent of 300 washing cycles by buffers (pH values 3, 5, and 7) or a commercial alkaline detergent, there was no change in the number of antimicrobial N-halamines on the modified materials. These results indicate that the reported LbL deposition technique results in antimicrobial N-halamine materials capable of long-term reuse and exposure to harsh chemicals as expected in a food-processing environment. Such robust, regenerably antimicrobial materials could be an effective technology in the food industry to prevent cross-contamination of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.\nPRACTICAL APPLICATION: The food contact surface of polyethylene was modified by layer-by-layer deposition of 2 polymers, resulting in a rechargeably antimicrobial surface. Repeated exposure to chlorine regenerated its antimicrobial activity, resulting in greater than 99.999% reduction in Listeria monocytogenes. Materials were stable against repeated washing and exposure to acidic environments. These food contact materials could support current cleaning and sanitization protocols in improving food safety in the processing environment.", "label": 1}

Despite the fact that benzimidazoles are promising compounds with activity against both protozoa, systematic studies to characterize and compare their structure\u2013activity relationships (SAR) are limited. Herein, we report a systematic characterization of the SAR of 32 benzimidazoles with activity against T. vaginalis and G. intestinalis. The analysis was based on pairwise comparisons of the activity similarity and molecular similarity using different molecular representations. Radial, MACCS keys, TGD and piDAPH3 fingerprints were used to develop consensus models of the landscape. The landscapes contained continuous regions and activity cliffs. Two \u2018deep consensus activity cliffs\u2019 and several pairs of compounds in smooth regions of the SAR were identified in the landscape of T. vaginalis. In contrast, a number of \u2018apparent and shallow cliffs\u2019 were found for G. intestinalis. Several compounds active for both parasites showed similar SAR suggesting a common mechanism of action. We also identified pairs of structurally similar molecules with dramatic changes in selectivity. Results suggested that while substitution at position 2 on the benzimidazole moiety plays an important role in increasing the potency against both parasites, substitutions at positions 4\u20137 could influence selectivity. This study represents a first step towards the systematic characterization of the antiprotozoal activity landscape of benzimidazoles, and has direct implications in the future development of other types of quantitative models. The landscape of larger data sets with other biological endpoints can be analyzed using the general approaches used in this work.", "label": 0}

The system consists of a Y-shaped channel formed in the bottom of a Plexiglas cup. The Luer-lock shaped ends of the Y-shaped channel are designed to host the connectors from the drainage bag, the catheter transfer set, and the bag of fresh dialysate. Because the connectors from the catheter transfer set and the fresh bag are located at the inner surface of the cup bed, and because the cup is filled with disinfectant during the entire exchange procedure, all at-risk steps are continuously protected by disinfectant (that is, removal of the caps from the connectors, connection and disconnection, replacement of the caps). Still, because the patient could inadvertently extract and contaminate one of the two connectors (although such a possibility is unlikely), the disinfecting efficacy of the system was tested in vitro. Despite contamination with various micro-organisms at the highest possible concentrations, all tests showed negative bacterial growth, thus confirming the absolute efficacy of the system in preventing exogenous transluminal peritonitis.", "label": 0}

Composition", "abstract": "Results of several studies show interactive effects of salinity and macronutrients on the growth of wheat plants. These effects may be associated with the nutrient status in plant tissues. The objective of this study was to investigate interactive effects of salinity and macronutrients on mineral element concentrations in leaves, stems, and grain of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Lona), grown in hydroponics, and the relation of these effects to yield components. Eight salinity levels were established from 0 to 150 mM NaCl, and 1, 0.2, and 0.04 strength Hoagland macronutrient solution (x HS) were used as the macronutrient levels. Sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), chlorine (Cl), and phosphorus (P) in leaves stems, and grain, NO3 in leaves and stems, and total nitrogen (N) in grain were determined. Supplemental Ca, Mg, K, and NO3 added to 0.2 x HS increased mineral concentrations in leaves and stems, but did not improve growth or yield in salinized wheat plants except moderately at 100-150 mM NaCl. In contrast, growth or yield was improved significantly when the concentration of macronutrients was increased from 0.04 to 0.2 x HS. In contrast to leaves and stems, mineral concentrations in grain increased (Na, Cl) or decreased (Ca, Mg, K) only slightly or were not affected (K) by salinity except at high salinity and low macronutrient level. Nitrogen and P concentrations in grain were not affected by salinity. Sodium and Cl concentrations in leaves and stems increased significantly, whereas K and NO3 decreased significantly, with an increase in salinity regardless of the macronutrient level. The latter was also observed for Ca and Mg in leaves. Extreme Na/Ca ratios in plant tissues negatively affected grain yield production at high salinity with medium or high macronutrient levels and at low macronutrient level together with medium salinity. Even though strong and significant correlations between mineral concentration at grain maturity in leaves, stems, and grain and various yield parameters were observed, our results are inconclusive as to whether toxicity, nutrient imbalance, nutrient deficiency, or all of these factors had a strong influence on grain yield.", "label": 0}

The present review focuses on 4 new quinolones that are commercially available (levofloxacin, trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin, and sparfloxacin) and 3 that are currently undergoing clinical trials (gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and clinafloxacin). Examination of the minimum inhibitory concentrations of these drugs against gram-positive, gram-negative, anaerobic, and atypical organisms demonstrates their increased potency in vitro. The available clinical evidence, although sparse, suggests the potential enhanced efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of various community-acquired and nosocomial infections (eg, respiratory, urinary tract, and skin infections and sexually transmitted diseases). Compared with ciprofloxacin, their pharmacokinetic profiles demonstrate equivalent or greater bio-availability, higher plasma concentrations, and increased tissue penetration, as reflected in greater volume of distribution. Adverse events seen with most quinolones are mild. Serious adverse effects that may occur are phototoxicity (particularly with sparfloxacin) and prolongation of the QTc interval (seen with sparfloxacin and grepafloxacin). Drug interactions are possible between multivalent cation-containing compounds and all quinolones and between theophylline and both ciprofloxacin and grepafloxacin. Drugs that prolong the QTc interval should not be coadministered with sparfloxacin and grepafloxacin. Step-down therapy, a therapeutic and cost-saving advantage possible with gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin, allows the switching of patients from intravenous to oral therapy without having to change the dosage regimen or class of antibiotics. In addition to shortening the hospital stay and reducing the risk of venous complications, step-down therapy has been shown to cut hospital drug costs by 40% and hospitalization costs by 20%.", "label": 0}

The solar photodegradation of the mixture of the three target antibiotics (amoxicillin (AMX), ciprofloxacin (CPX), and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ)) was also evaluated. Additionally, since UWWTP effluents are possible sources of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria, the disinfection by conventional chlorination process of the UWWTP effluent inoculated with MDR strains was investigated too. Solar radiation poorly affected the inactivation of the two selected antibiotic resistant E. coli strains (40 and 60% after 180 min irradiation). Moreover, solar radiation did not affect strain resistance to AMX (MIC > 256 mu g/mL) and SMZ (MIC > 1024 mu g/mL), but affected resistance of the lower resistance strain to CPX (MIC decreased by 33% but only after 180 min of irradiation). Chlorination of wastewater sample strongly decreased the number of the two selected antibiotic resistant E. coli strains (99.667 and 99.999%), after 60 min of contact time at 2.0 mg/L initial chlorine concentration, but the resistance of survived colonies to antibiotics was unchanged. Finally, the solar photodegradation rate of the antibiotic mixture (1 mg/L initial concentration respectively) resulted in the following order (half-life time): CPX (t(1/2) = 24 min)< AMX (t(1/2) = 99 min)< SMZ (t(1/2) = 577 min). Accordingly, the risk of the development of resistance to SMZ in surface water is significantly higher compared to CPX and AMX. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "label": 1}

The attenuated total reflectance (ATR) technique of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) is ideally suited to monitor molecular interactions at the solution/internal reflection element (IRE) interface, and we report its application to biofilm research. Two methodologies were utilized to obtain the ATF/FT-IR spectra of living Caulobacter crescentus cells attached to germanium crystals. Initially, spectra of attached bacteria in high purity water produced molecular details of the attachment process without spectral interferences from components of the medium. A growth medium, utilized in the second method, allowed direct examination of the infrared absorption bands associated with the actively growing microorganisms on the surface of the IRE in the spectral region of 2000 to 1200 cm?1. Using the amide II band as a marker for biofilm biomass, the detection limit was determined to be approximately 5 \u00d7 105 cells\u00b7cm?2.

These biofilms are a source of planktonic bacteria, which will remain present when the water is delivered through a consumer's tap. The presence of biofilms in DWDS constitutes one of the currently recognized hazards affecting the microbiological quality of the product and may lead to a number of unwanted effects on the organoleptic quality of the distributed water.

EW was diluted to obtain different free chlorine concentrations (120, 60 and 12\u00a0ppm) and to compare with standard washing treatment of 120\u00a0ppm chlorine solution. Shelf-life quality and safety markers were studied at the beginning and at the end of the 7-day-storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The use of EW decreased the respiration rate of the samples which might be related with the observed reduction in microbial spoilage. The use of EW also increased the activity of a browning-related enzyme (polyphenoloxydase) although sensory results showed all samples as acceptable at the end of the 7\u00a0day-storage. Perhaps longer storage time might increase the risk to browning development in the samples treated with EW. The highest EW concentration (120\u00a0ppm free chlorine) was the most effective treatment in reducing sample microbial load; however this treatment also affected the final produce with effects such as loss of turgor, plasmolysis and a reduction in mineral content. Results suggest an intermediate EW concentration with 60\u00a0ppm free chlorine could be an alternative to 120\u00a0ppm chlorine (from sodium hypochlorite) for sanitizing fresh-cut vegetables, reducing to half the amount of chlorine used and maintaining the antimicrobial effectiveness and without differences affecting the quality. However further studies will be necessary in order to observe the effect of the oxidising capacity of EW on other quality and safety markers as pathogens and nutritional content. Industrial relevance Chlorine solutions have been widely used to sanitise fruit and vegetables in the fresh-cut industry. However, the association of chlorine with the possible formation of carcinogenic chlorinated compounds in water has called into question the use of chlorine in food processing. The efficacy in controlling the microbial load and browning of samples treated with electrolysed water shows it as a promising decontaminant agent for fresh-cut lettuce. Due to the high oxidising potential of the EW quality requirements must be balanced to obtain the optimal treatment conditions keeping satisfying safety levels. The use of EW-60 showed similar safety and quality (browning) results as the use of chlorine or double EW concentration (EW-120). However the treatment EW-120 affected negatively the textural properties. The study suggests the use of EW-60 as an alternative to sodium hypochlorite solution with 120 ppm available chlorine, obtaining similar safety and quality results and reducing the amount of chlorine needed. Further investigations in the effect of EW on lettuce, such as those on pathogens or nutritional markers (e.g. carotenoids and vitamin C) are recommended in order to explore this alternative that might reduce the increasingly concerning use of chlorine to decontaminate this type of product.", "label": 1}

{"id": "4516", "title": "Molecular pathogen detection in biosolids with a focus on quantitative PCR using propidium monoazide for viable cell enumeration", "abstract": "Sewage sludge is the solid, organic material remaining after wastewater is treated and discharged from a wastewater treatment plant. Sludge is treated to stabilize the organic matter and reduce the amount of human pathogens. Once government regulations are met, including material quality standards (e.g., E. coli levels and heavy metal content) sludge is termed \u201cbiosolids\u201d, which may be disposed of by land application according to regulations. Live-culture techniques have traditionally been used to enumerate select pathogens and/or indicator organisms to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements. However, these methods may result in underestimates of viable microorganisms due to several problems, including their inability to detect viable but non-culturable (VBNC) cells. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is currently under investigation as a fast, sensitive, and specific molecular tool for enumeration of pathogens in biosolids. Its main limitation is that it amplifies all target DNAs, including that from non-viable cells. This can be overcome by coupling qPCR with propidium monoazide (PMA), a microbial membrane-impermeant dye that binds to extracellular DNA and DNA in dead or membrane-compromised cells, inhibiting its amplification. PMA has successfully been used to monitor the presence of viable pathogens in several different matrices. In this review the use of PMA\u2013qPCR is discussed as a suitable approach for viable microbial enumeration in biosolids. Recommendations for optimization of the method are made, with a focus on DNA extraction, dilution of sample turbidity, reagent concentration, and light exposure time.", "label": 0}

Changes in proteomes of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and the Gram-negative one, Escherichia coli, were evaluated. Up and down-regulated proteins in these bacteria after growth under the inhibition with four different disinfectants based on chloride and bromide salts of pyridinium oxime were identified and their cellular localizations and functions were determined by gene ontology searching. Proteome changes presented here demonstrate different mechanisms of action of these disinfectants. In the Gram-positive food pathogen Bacillus subtilis, the inhibitory substances seem to act mainly at the cell surface and cause significant alterations of membrane and cell surface proteins. On the other hand, intracellular proteins were more affected in the Gram-negative pathogen Escherichia coli. This research is a contribution to the investigation of the virulence and pathogenicity of food borne bacteria and their survival under stress conditions, and can also lead the way for further development of new inhibitors of microbial growth and studies of mechanism of their actions.", "label": 0}

The biofilms formed were observed in situ by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Using the biofilms established, biocidal efficacy of several halogen biocides, such as hypochlorite (HOCl), bromochlorodimethylhydantoin (Br, Cl-DMH), ammonia monochloramine (NH 2Cl), a stabilized hypobromite biocide named STABREX\u00ae, and a mixed solution of NH4Br and HOCl, was evaluated. The formation of NHBrCl in the mixed solution was indicated by UV spectra analysis. Biofilm cells were more resistant to these biocides than planktonic cells and the extent of resistance varied with the biocide tested. Among the biocides tested, the biocidal potency of HOCl was the most susceptible to the change brought about by biofilm formation. By CLSM observation, differences in biofilm conformation were revealed between the microbial species. The efficacy of the biocide tested varied with the structure of biofilms formed. The assay method developed in the present study would be useful for further investigation on biofilm disinfection. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "label": 0}

Sprouts, such as mung bean, alfalfa, radish, and broccoli, are minimally processed and have been sources for foodborne illness. Currently, a 20,000\u00a0ppm calcium hypochlorite soak is recommended for the treatment of sprouting seeds. In this study, the efficacy of an antimicrobial carvacrol nanoemulsion was tested against Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Enteritidis (ATCC BAA-1045) or EGFP expressing Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 42895) contaminated sprouting seeds. Antimicrobial treatments were performed by soaking inoculated seeds in nanoemulsions (4000 or 8000\u00a0ppm) for 30 or 60\u00a0min. Following treatment, surviving cells were determined by performing plate counts and/or Most Probable Number (MPN) enumeration. Treated seeds were sprouted and tested for the presence of pathogens. Treatment successfully inactivated low levels (2 and 3 log CFU/g) of S. Enteritidis and E.\u00a0coli on radish seeds when soaked for 60\u00a0min at concentrations ?4000 (0.4%) ppm carvacrol.

In this study, silver nanoparticle-supported silica micro beads (Ag-NPBs) with sizes ranging from 180 to 500 ?m have been prepared. Silica gel was synthesized by a sol-gel route and crushed into micro beads, which were modified with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane by so-called dry method. Silver nanoparticles were directly created on the surface and in the pores of the modified silica by chemical reduction. The prepared materials were characterized with FT-IR, BET, XRD, FE-SEM, FE-STEM, UV-vis spectrophotometer, and optical microscope. Silver nanoparticles mostly distributed at the outer layer of amino functionalized silica beads. Ag-NPBs samples were examined for their antibacterial properties against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis). The excellent antibacterial properties of Ag-NPBs were confirmed with zone inhibition and test tube test.

Intense absorption, strong fluorescence, and reversible oxidation and reduction processes are common to all of these dyes. Their characterization as organic semiconductors in vacuum-processed thin-film transistors reveals p-channel operation with field-effect mobilities ranging from 0.01 to 0.7 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The highest mobility is found for the DPP dyes bearing the 2-ethylhexyl substituents, which is surprising, considering that as a result of the chiral substituents, this material is a mixture of (R,R), (S,S), and (R,S) stereoisomers. The high carrier mobility in the films of the DPPs bearing stereoisomerically inhomogeneous ethylhexyl groups is rationalized here by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis in combination with XRD and atomic force microscopy studies on thin films, which reveal the presence of slightly different 2D layer arrangements for the n-alkyl and the 2-ethylhexyl derivatives.

Here, we generated echovirus 11 (E11) with resistance to chlorine dioxide (ClO2) by experimental evolution, and we assessed the associated genotypic and phenotypic traits. ClO2 resistance emerged after E11 populations were repeatedly reduced (either by ClO2-exposure or by dilution) and then regrown in cell culture. The resistance was linked to an improved capacity of E11 to bind to its host cells, which was further attributed to two potential causes: first, the resistant E11 populations possessed mutations that caused amino acid substitutions from ClO2-labile to ClO2-stable residues in the viral proteins, which likely increased the chemical stability of the capsid toward ClO2. Second, resistant E11 mutants exhibited the capacity to utilize alternative cell receptors for host binding. Interestingly, the emergence of ClO2 resistance resulted in an enhanced replicative fitness compared to the less resistant starting population. Overall this study contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism underlying disinfection resistance in waterborne viruses, and processes that drive resistance development.", "label": 0}

Fresh produce inoculated with bacterial pathogens (similar to 9 log CFU/mL) was immersed in distilled water (DW), SAEW, FA (0.5%), or CaO (0.2%) alone or in combination at 23 +/- 2 degrees C for 3 min followed by treatment with US, MB for 3 min, or UV for 10 min. Effects of combined treatment on shelf-life of lettuce at 4 degrees C and 23 +/- 2 degrees C were also determined in this study. Results revealed that the use of a combination of CaO + SAEW + FA + US exhibited significant reduction (p < 0.05) for bacterial pathogen on fresh produce compared to individual treatment or other combinations.

The authors evaluated the efficacy of two disinfectant solutions and microwave irradiation in disinfecting complete dentures contaminated with MRSA. Methods The authors contaminated 36 simulated complete dentures with MRSA and divided them into four equal groups: a positive control group consisting of dentures that were not disinfected; a group that soaked in 1 percent sodium hypochlorite for 10 minutes; a group that soaked in 2 percent chlorhexidine gluconate for 10 minutes; and a group that underwent microwave irradiation at 650 watts for three minutes. The authors quantified colony counts and evaluated the long-term effectiveness of disinfection. Results All dentures from the control group showed substantial microbial growth on the plates (6.24 log10 colony-forming units per milliliter). The authors observed no evidence of microbial growth on plates of any disinfected dentures. After seven days' incubation, the authors observed broth turbidity in all beakers containing the dentures disinfected with 1 percent sodium hypochlorite. Conclusions Soaking in chlorhexidine gluconate solution and microwave irradiation resulted in complete disinfection of all dentures contaminated with MRSA in both the short and the long term. Soaking in sodium hypochlorite solution was effective only as a short-term disinfectant.

In this context a characteristics and comparison of antifungal properties of 19 sulfone derivatives were conducted. MICs of the Compounds were determined using the M27-A3 protocol following CLSI recommendations. The SAP expression was analyzed using RT-PCR; relative quantification was normalized against ACT1 in cells grown in YEPD and on Caco-2. 79 % of sulfone derivatives (15 out of 19) exhibited an activity against Candida albicans in the tested concentrations. While the addition of both chlorine and bromine atoms to halogenomethylsulfonyl groups stimulates sulfone's antifungal activity, a chlorine atom more effectively up-regulates antifungal properties of the tested sulfones. The insertion of a fluorine atom has a binary effect on antifungal properties of the tested sulfones. The fluorine atom enhances anti-Candida properties when introduced to the aromatic ring, while its presence in halogenomethylsulfonyl group generally lowers the Compound's efficiency. The deletion of particular SAP genes resulted in an increased susceptibility of C. albicans toward sulfones indicating the role of this gene family in resistance mechanisms.

Methods to control adherent microorganisms and subsequent biofilms in the food processing plant are discussed. It is apparent from the data that has been reviewed that the potential for the development of microbial biofilms in the environment of the food processing plant exists. However, the cleaning and sanitizing practices carried out in the food industry have been shown to control biofilm formation on food contact surfaces. Microbial attachment has been shown to occur on non-food contact surfaces and these attached microbes, if left undisturbed, will form biofilms.

We hypothesized that biofilm formation would enhance the adhesion and survival of Salmonella on leafy vegetables. To test our hypothesis, we compared the adhesion and persistence of Salmonella Typhimurium and its biofilm-deficient isogenic mutant. Following inoculation of parsley and rinsing with water or chlorine solution, both strains had similar survival properties, and up to 3-log reduction were observed, depending on chlorine concentration. This indicates that the biofilm matrix of Salmonella likely does not play a significant role in initial adhesion and survival after disinfection. After a week of storage the biofilm producing strain survived chlorination significantly better than the biofilm-deficient mutant. However, the recovery of the mutant was still elevated, indicating that although the biofilm matrix has a role in persistence of Salmonella after chlorination treatment of parsley, this is not the most important mechanism, and other mechanisms, probably the ability to penetrate the plant tissue or the pre-existing biofilms, or production of different polysaccharides other than cellulose, provide the protection.", "label": 1}

In most instances, transmission has been water-and foodborne. The seasonality of Cyclospora in areas of endemicity is well defined, suggesting that it has specific requirements to survive and, under adequate conditions, may be able to start a new endemic cycle. Oocysts are highly resistant to pesticides (Captan 50% W. P., Benomyl 50% W. P., Diazinon 47.5%, Malathion 25% W. P. and Zineb 75% W. P) commonly used on farms and to sanitizers and disinfectants (Timsen, Tsunami, hydrogen peroxide, ammonium hydroxide and gaseous chlorine dioxide) used by the food industry. Although dogs have been epidemiologically associated with cases of cyclosporiasis, in a cohort study we report three dogs excreting oocysts, indicating that it is associated with the coprophagic habits of the dogs and not because of true infection. A survey of ten points of the sewer system serving a community of 450 people taken at different periods of time suggests that sewer testing could well be used as an indicator to determine whether the community has Cyclospora. The sewer information will reflect the Cyclospora activity in the community by assisting in identifying positive communities and to determine seasonality. The specific conditions required for this parasite's viability in the environment are still not known.", "label": 0}

Multifaceted research has been directed for decades to identify, characterize, and understand the toxicology of these compounds, control and minimize their formation, and conduct epidemiologic studies related to exposure. Urinary bladder cancer has been the health risk most consistently associated with CxDBPs in epidemiologic studies. An international workshop was held to (1) discuss the qualitative strengths and limitations that inform the association between bladder cancer and CxDBPs in the context of possible causation, (2) identify knowledge gaps for this topic in relation to chlorine/chloramine-based disinfection practice(s) in the United States, and (3) assess the evidence for informing risk management. Epidemiological evidence linking exposures to CxDBPs in drinking water to human bladder cancer risk provides insight into causality. However, because of imprecise, inaccurate, or incomplete estimation of CxDBPs levels in epidemiologic studies, translation from hazard identification directly to risk management and regulatory policy for CxDBPs can be challenging. Quantitative risk estimates derived from toxicological risk assessment for CxDBPs currently cannot be reconciled with those from epidemiologic studies, notwithstanding the complexities involved, making regulatory interpretation difficult. Evidence presented here has both strengths and limitations that require additional studies to resolve and improve the understanding of exposure response relationships. Replication of epidemiologic findings in independent populations with further elaboration of exposure assessment is needed to strengthen the knowledge base needed to better inform effective regulatory approaches.", "label": 0}

Hands can readily become contaminated after contact with such surfaces, and self-inoculation may lead to infection. Whereas hand washing is crucial in preventing the spread of rhinovirus colds, proper disinfection of environmental surfaces may further reduce rhinovirus transmission. In this study, the capacities of Lysol Disinfectant Spray (0.1% o-phenylphenol and 79% ethanol), a domestic bleach (6% sodium hypochlorite diluted to give 800 ppm of free chlorine), a quaternary ammonium-based product (7.05% quaternary ammonium diluted 1:128 in tap water), and a phenol-based product (14.7% phenol diluted 1:256 in tap water) were compared in interrupting the transfer of rhinovirus type 14 from stainless steel disks to fingerpads of human volunteers upon a 10-s contact at a pressure of 1 kg/cm2. Ten microliters of the virus, suspended in bovine mucin (5 mg/ml), was placed on each disk, and the inoculum was dried under ambient conditions; the input number on each disk ranged from 0.5 x 10(5) to 2.1 x 10(6) PFU. The dried virus was exposed to 20 mul of the test disinfectant. The Lysol spray was able to reduce virus infectivity by >99.99% after a contact of either 1 or 10 min, and no detectable virus was transferred to fingerpads from Lysol-treated disks. The bleach (800 ppm of free chlorine) reduced the virus titer by 99.7% after a contact time of 10 min, and again no virus was transferred from the disks treated with it. On the other hand, the quaternary ammonium and phenolic products were able to inactivate only 14.7 and 62.3% of the virus on the disks, respectively; contact of fingerpads with disks treated separately with these products resulted in the transfer of 8.4% +/- 3.6 and 3.3% +/- 1.9%, respectively, of the infectious virus remaining on the disks after the disinfectant was allowed to dry. Virus transfer from the control disks was 0.58% +/- 0.35%. These findings suggest that care must be exercised in the selection of disinfectants if transfer of rhinoviruses from environmental surfaces to human hands is to be interrupted efficiently.", "label": 0}

Results showed that 1) ORP served as a useful proxy for chlorination in plastic containers up to 24 h; 2) most stored water samples disinfected by chlorination remained significantly less contaminated than source water for up to 72 h, even in the absence of FCR; 3) TCR may be a useful proxy indicator of microbiologic water quality because it confirms previous chlorination and is associated with a lower risk of E. coli contamination compared to untreated source water; and 4) chlorination is more effective in plastic than clay containers presumably because of lower chlorine demand in plastic.", "label": 1}

However, the impact this sanitizer has on the redn. of pathogenic microorganisms differs depending on the microorganism and produce in question, although it is generally limited to a 1-2 log redn., when using concns. permitted for produce. An investigation of the impact of aq. chlorine sanitization on generic E. coli during postharvest and fresh-cut processing of iceberg lettuce was conducted at The University of Arizona, Yuma Agricultural Center, USA. Common com. practices were simulated using a high bacterial load (108 cfu/mL) culture to contaminate a harvesting tool to assess the no. of heads affected from one contamination and the effectiveness of approved sanitizers. Results showed that as many as 75 heads of lettuce could be contaminated with the continued use of a contaminated harvest tool quitar used to core the heads. The concn. of bacterial contamination is reduced if the cored region is sprayed with a sanitizer immediately after coring. While using water alone on the cored region produced 105 cfu/g, using either chlorine or peroxyacetic acid (PAA) showed only a decrease to 104 cfu/g. The use of the sanitizers in different frequency and in combination as an alternative to the common triple treatment with chlorine, showed the latter as the treatment with the most effective redn. on generic E. coli. The level of redn. was still insufficient to ensure the safety of the lettuce if a high microbial contamination were to occur. This work reveals the high risks assocd. with the lack of a continuous system for decontaminating harvesting tools and equipment, and highlights the need for further research to identify a better multiple-rinse sanitation system, than the predominant chlorine washes and the emerging approved alternatives.

Pseudomonas fluorescens strains were generally less susceptible than strains of Ps. lundensis and Ps. fragi. An overnight incubation in medium containing 200 micrograms ml-1 BC was sufficient to reduce the susceptibility of two Pseudomonas strains to the lethal effect of BC significantly. Adding EDTA enhanced the lethal effect of BC, but the effect was reduced after growing cells in medium containing BC and EDTA. Growth in medium with a quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) rendered the cells more susceptible to chlorine, phenolics, and alkylaminoacetate. These results indicate that alternating use of QACs with these compounds can be used to avoid build-up of resistant strains. In addition, increased temperatures improved the lethal effect of BC and should be considered when planning disinfection routines.", "label": 1}

This study collected data over a one-year period from a full-scale DPR demonstration facility, and used both performance distribution functions (PDFs) and quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) to define and evaluate the reliability of the advanced water treatment facility (AWTF). The AWTF's ability to control enterovirus, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium was characterized using online monitoring of surrogates in a treatment train consisting of ozone, biological activated carbon, microfiltration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light with an advanced oxidation process. This process train was selected to improve reliability by providing redundancy, defined as the provision of treatment beyond the minimum needed to meet regulatory requirements. The PDFs demonstrated treatment that consistently exceeded the 12/10/10-log thresholds for virus, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium, as currently required for potable reuse in California (via groundwater recharge and surface water augmentation). Because no critical process failures impacted pathogen removal performance during the yearlong testing, hypothetical failures were incorporated into the analysis to understand the benefit of treatment redundancy on performance. Each unit process was modeled with a single failure per year lasting four different failure durations: 15 min, 60 min, 8 h, and 24 h. QMRA was used to quantify the impact of failures on pathogen risk. The median annual risk of infection for Cryptosporidium was 4.9 x 10(-11) in the absence of failures, and reached a maximum of 1.1 x 10(-5) assuming one 24-h failure per process per year. With the inclusion of free chlorine disinfection as part of the treatment process, enterovirus had a median annual infection risk of 1.5 x 10(-14) (no failures) and a maximum annual value of 2.1 x 10(-5) (assuming one 24-h failure per year). Even with conservative failure assumptions, pathogen risk from this treatment train remains below the risk targets for both the U.S. (10(-4) infections/person/year) and the WHO (approximately 10(-3) infections/person/year, equivalent to 10(-6) DALY/person/year), demonstrating the value of a failure prevention strategy based on treatment redundancy.", "label": 1}

A prominent challenge for the successful use of MWW for cooling is potentially severe mineral deposition (scaling) on pipe surfaces. In this study, theor., lab., and field work was conducted to evaluate the mineral deposition potential of MWW and its deposition control strategies under conditions relevant to power plant cooling systems. Polymaleic acid (PMA) was found to effectively reduce scale formation when the makeup water was concd. four times in a recirculating cooling system. It was the most effective deposition inhibitor of those studied when applied at 10 mg/L dosing level in a synthetic MWW. However, the deposition inhibition by PMA was compromised by free chlorine added for biogrowth control. Ammonia present in the wastewater suppressed the reaction of the free chlorine with PMA through the formation of chloramines. Monochloramine, an alternative to free chlorine, was found to be less reactive with PMA than free chlorine. In pilot tests, scaling control was more challenging due to the occurrence of biofouling even with effective control of suspended bacteria. Phosphorous-based corrosion inhibitors are not appropriate due to their significant loss through pptn. reactions with calcium. Chem. equil. modeling helped with interpretation of mineral pptn. behavior but must be used with caution for recirculating cooling systems, esp. with use of MWW, where kinetic limitations and complex water chemistries often prevail.

A. nidulans exhibited the greatest resistance, requiring 10 ppm of chlorine for 30 min contact time for a complete inactivation. Under the same experimental conditions, peracetic acid was even less fungicidal. In this case, A. niger proved to be the most resistant species (50 ppm for 60 min for complete inactivation). All Aspergillus spp. were insensitive to 10 ppm even with extended exposure (>5 h). The combination of chlorine and peracetic acid against Aspergillus spp. did not show synergistic effects except in the case of A. flavus. Complete growth inhibition of C. albicans was observed after about 3 h contact time with 0.2 ppm. C. albicans was less sensitive to peracetic acid. Hence the concentrations of chlorine that are usually present in drinking water distribution systems are ineffective against several Aspergillus spp. and peracetic acid cannot be considered an alternative to chlorine for disinfecting drinking water.

It comprises cleaning and either disinfection or sterilization as appropriate. Cleaning physically removes infectious agents and the organic matter on which they thrive, but does not necessarily destroy them. Disinfection is a process of inactivating pathogenic organisms except for bacterial spores. Sterilization is the elimination of all viable microorganisms. Single-use medical devices resolve the difficulties of reuse and decontamination procedures and should be used where appropriate. Healthcare-associated infections place a serious burden on the NHS and healthcare organizations have a legal responsibility to implement changes to reduce infections. An effective infection control system relies on the whole of an organization and not just those areas processing equipment.

In addition, quenching of the bactericidal activity of the sanitizers by organic matter (Tryptone Soya Broth, TSB) was determined against B. cereus DL5 cells. Bacillus cells were grown in TSB or one-tenth strength TSB. Sanitizers were tested against 8- and 24-h-old cells at recommended and double recommended concentrations, for 1 min or 10 min, or at recommended concentrations against 24-h-old planktonic cells allowing 1 min exposure for quenching studies. The surface morphology and viability of planktonic B. cereus DL5 cells exposed to double recommended concentrations of each sanitizer were also assessed by scanning electron microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy, respectively. Bacillus cereus DL5 was generally more susceptible to all sanitizers; than B. subtilis EL39, and attached cells of both isolates were less susceptible to all sanitizers than corresponding planktonic or PIPS cells. Double the recommended sanitizer concentrations and exposure times of 10 min generally resulted in higher percentage kills for all cell types of both isolates. In the absence of TSB, log reductions were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in its presence for CD and PPA but not for QAC. Microscopic observations were based on plate count results and indicated that CD and QAC were more effective than PPA. Overall, chlorine dioxide was the most effective sanitizer against all cell types of both isolates in the absence of TSB. Organic matter such as soils on food contact surfaces may lower the efficacy of CD- and PPA-based sanitizers. These results have implications for the food processing industry.", "label": 0}
{"id": "2289", "title": "The influence of plasma on the disinfecting activity of the new antimicrobial agent N-chlorotaurine-sodium in comparison with chloramine T", "abstract": "The phenomenon of increasing bactericidal activity of N-chlorotaurine in the presence of chlorine-consuming material has been investigated both on a chemical-analytical and microbiological basis using plasma as substrate and chloramine T for comparison. Chlorine consumption assessed by iodometric titration showed a biphasic time-course with a very fast loss of oxidation capacity within one minute (N-chlorotaurine: -9.3%, chloramine T: -16.8%) followed by a slow loss which could still be detected after 24 h (total loss -61.7% and -74.1%, respectively). Killing curves revealed that an increase in bactericidal activity, in spite of improved consumption, did not occur with all strains, and could be detected only at a certain degree of consumption. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the most pronounced effect, Streptococcus pyogenes and Proteus mirabilis a medium-sized one, while it was absent in Staphylococcus aureus. With chloramine T, an increase in bactericidal activity could not be proved. The chemical basis of these consumption effects can be reduced to four reaction types: oxidation of thiols; chlorine substitution of activated C-H compounds; transhalogenation; and hydrolytic degradation of N-chloro-alpha-amino acids and -peptides emerging by transhalogenation. The initial fast loss of oxidation capacity can be attributed mainly to oxidation of thiols, while the subsequent slower decrease is caused by the other types of reaction. The increase in bactericidal activity, on the other hand, can be explained by transhalogenation, leading to the formation of more bactericidal N-chloro compounds by which the loss of N-chlorotaurine is over-compensated.", "label": 0}

Different analogues of the antitumor antibiotic rebeccamycin substituted on the imide nitrogen with a methyl group were synthesized. These compounds bore either the sugar residue of rebeccamycin, with or without the chlorine atoms on the indole moieties, or modified sugar residues (galactopyranosyl, glucopyranosyl, or fucopyranosyl) linked to the aglycone via a beta- or alpha-N-glycosidic bond. Their inhibitory properties toward protein kinase C, topoisomerase I, and topoisomerase II were examined, and their DNA-binding properties were investigated. Their in vitro antitumor activities against murine B16 melanoma and P388 leukemia cells were determined. Their antimicrobial activities were tested against Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis, Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, and yeast Candida albicans. These compounds are inactive toward topoisomerase II but inhibit topoisomerase I. A substitution with a methyl group on the imide nitrogen led to a loss of proteine kinase C inhibition in the maleimide indolocarbazole series but did not prevent topoisomerase I inhibition. Compounds possessing a beta-N-glycosidic bond, which fully intercalated into DNA, were more efficient at inhibiting topoisomerase I than their analogues with an alpha-N-glycosidic bond; however, both were equally toxic toward P388 leukemia cells. Dechlorinated rebeccamycin possessing a methyl group on the imide nitrogen was about 10 times more efficient in terms of cytotoxicity and inhibition of topoisomerase I than the natural metabolite.", "label": 0}

In this study, we synthesized NPs from a medicinally important plant - Plumbago zeylanica. Materials and methods: Aqueous root extract of P. zeylanica (PZRE) was analyzed for the presence of flavonoids, sugars, and organic acids using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS), and biochemical methods. The silver NPs (AgNPs), gold NPs (AuNPs), and bimetallic NPs (AgAuNPs) were synthesized from root extract and characterized using ultraviolet-visible spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The effects of these NPs on Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli biofilms were studied using quantitative biofilm inhibition and disruption assays, as well as using fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Results: PZRE showed the presence of phenolics, such as plumbagin, and flavonoids, in addition to citric acid, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and starch, using HPTLC, GC-TOF-MS, and quantitative analysis. Bioreduction of silver nitrate (AgNO3) and chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) were confirmed at absorbances of 440 nm (AgNPs), 570 nm (AuNPs), and 540 nm (AgAuNPs), respectively. The maximum rate of synthesis at 50\u00b0C was achieved with 5 mM AgNO3 within 4.5 hours for AgNPs; and with 0.7 mM HAuCl4 within 5 hours for AuNPs. The synthesis of AgAuNPs, which completed within 90 minutes with 0.7 mM AgNO3 and HAuCl4, was found to be the fastest. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed bioreduction, while EDS and XRD patterns confirmed purity and the crystalline nature of the NPs, respectively. TEM micrographs and DLS showed about 60 nm monodispersed Ag nanospheres, 20-30 nm Au nanospheres adhering to form Au nanotriangles, and about 90 nm hexagonal blunt-ended AgAuNPs. These NPs also showed antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against E. coli, A. baumannii, S. aureus, and a mixed culture of A. baumannii and S. aureus. AgNPs inhibited biofilm in the range of 96%-99% and AgAuNPs from 93% to 98% in single-culture biofilms. AuNPs also showed biofilm inhibition, with the highest of 98% in S. aureus. AgNPs also showed good biofilm disruption, with the highest of 88% in A. baumannii.

In this work, we have examined the biofilm control effectivity of a combined disinfectant comprised of hydrogen peroxide and silver ions. The performance of the combined disinfectant was compared to the effectivity of each of the ingredients alone and to the effectivity of chlorine disinfectant. Biofilm growth was investigated on uncoated and CaCO3 coated galvanized iron samples over prolonged exposure duration. It was found that the CaCO3 film does not significantly affect biofilm development. A combination of hydrogen peroxide and silver ions (30 ppm hydrogen peroxide and 30 ppb silver ions) were as effective in preventing film growth as hydrogen peroxide alone (30 ppm). Both compositions showed significant biofilm prevention effectivity as compared to silver ions alone. Biofilm prevention effectivity of chlorine (approximately 1 ppm) was considerably higher than that of the combined disinfectant. The bacteria that survived after 48 hours disinfection with hydrogen peroxide and the combined disinfectant showed high catalase activity hinting that hydrogen peroxide and the combined disinfectant may have a rather limited effectivity in continuous operation.", "label": 0}

Sodium hypochlorite fulfills many requirements as the ideal disinfectant and furthermore it has an excellent cleaning action. The effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite in the cleaning and disinfection processes depends on the concentration of available chlorine and the pH of the solution. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is a weak acid and dissociates to the hypochlorite ion (-OCl) and proton (H+) depending on the solution pH. It is generally believed that HOCl is the active species in the germicidal action, whereas the concentration of -OCl is a key factor determining the cleaning efficiency. This implies that the optimal pH region of the germicidal activity of sodium hypochlorite differs from that of its cleaning activity. This paper describes the theory and practice of the cleaning and disinfecting operations based on the use of sodium hypochlorite solution.", "label": 1}

The amounts of amide N-chloramine structures before and after the sterilization were quantified to indicate the stabilities of these amide N-chloramine structures to the sterilization. The samples after sterilization were challenged with a clinical isolate of healthcare-associated multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli. N-Chloramine structure converted from polymethacrylamide (dressing 2) had the highest durability (89.7% retained active chlorine) toward EtO sterilization; that from hydantoin (dressing 3; 86.3% retained active chlorine) followed; and poly(N-chloroacrylamide) (dressing 1) had the lowest (64.0% retained active chlorine). After EtO sterilization, all the samples still reduced E. coli presence at 5 minutes of contact, with dressing 2 retaining a log 6 reduction. The three tested amide N-chloramine structures could all survive EtO sterilization while retaining percentages of active chlorine ranging from 64.0 to 89.7%. Dressing 2 showed the best durability, whereas dressing 1 had the poorest durability.

The structure-activity investigation showed that the substituted position of chlorine significantly influenced the activity and selectivity. The alteration of tertiary amine group also leads to obvious change in bioactivity.

M. avium biofilm has recently been identified on sauna walls and in city water pipes and might have a role in the survival of virulent strains in the environment and in the host. To characterize the M. avium biofilm, an in vitro model was adapted wherein biofilm develops on a PVC surface. Biofilm was detected by staining with crystal violet and visualization by optical microscopy and quantified by A(570). M. avium strains MAC 101, MAC 100, MAC 104, MAC 109, MAC A5 and MAC 5501 (all isolated from the blood of AIDS patients) were used in the assays. Biofilm formation was dependent on the presence of Ca(2+), Mg(2+) or Zn(2+) ions in the water, with the maximal effect seen at a concentration of 1 micro M. The presence of 2 % glucose and peptone as sources of carbon increased the formation of biofilm, while this was partially inhibited by humic acid. Since sliding motility has been associated with the amount of glycopeptidolipid (GPL), TLC was used to determine the presence of GPL. The supernatant of a biofilm-forming culture induced formation of a stable biofilm and amikacin blocked the establishment of biofilm by M. avium strains at subinhibitory concentrations. Bacteria in the biofilm were more resistant to chlorine as well as to exposure to potassium monopersulfate and chloroheximide acetate than were planktonic bacteria. Identification of M. avium genes involved in biofilm formation and further studies of the effect of antimicrobials on the establishment of biofilm may identify approaches for inhibiting M. avium biofilm formation and colonization.", "label": 1}

The D-value (1-log reduction) for MNV-1 in kimchi, calculated using first-order kinetics, was 5.75 kGy (R2 = 0.98, RMSE = 0.10). Therefore, this study suggests that the use of ? 5.75 kGy gamma radiation in the kimchi manufacturing industry could be very effective in reducing NoV contamination by &gt; 90% (1 log), without causing changes in quality and fermentation.", "label": 0}

Due to on-going concerns related to human health the use of ceftiofur was eventually phased out of the poultry production industry in 2014\u20132015. Simultaneous resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftiofur and cefoxitin, a pattern known as A2C, caused by the presence of blaCMY-2 has become increasingly prevalent in broiler flocks worldwide. This study used data from the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS) broiler farm surveillance program to examine the risk factors for A2C resistant Escherichia coli isolates (A2C-REI) from 1482 samples taken from 371 broiler flocks in Canada, between 2013 and 2015. Results of a mixed effects Poisson model with fixed effects at the flock level and random effects at the hatchery level indicated that the in ovo use of ceftiofur (Prevalence Ratio (PR): 1.91, 95% CI: 1.43\u20132.57), and the use of hydrogen peroxide to disinfect water lines during the growing period (PR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.11\u20132.07), were risk factors for increased expected prevalence of A2C-REI, compared to farms not using these strategies. Controlling for wild birds (PR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.48\u20130.84), use of avilamycin in feed (PR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.41\u20130.98), and storage of manure on the farm (PR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.51\u20130.89) were associated with a lower expected prevalence of A2C-REI, than farms that did not use these strategies. This study identified important management factors that were associated with the prevalence of A2C-REI on Canadian broiler farms. The findings of this study can be used as a baseline for the monitoring of the effects of the removal of ceftiofur from poultry production in Canada.", "label": 0}

The cytotoxic activity of the new ruthenium(II) and iridium(III) compounds has been evaluated in a panel of cell lines (A2780, A2780cisR, A427, 5637, LCLC, SISO, and HT29) in order to investigate structure-activity relationships. Phenyl substitution at the R4 position shows increased potency in both Ru and Ir complexes (3g and 4g, respectively) as compared to their parent compounds (3a and 4a) in all cell lines. In general, ruthenium complexes are more active than the corresponding iridium complexes. The new ruthenium and iridium compounds increased caspase-3 activity in A2780 cells, as shown for 3a,d and 4a,d. Compound 4g is able to increase the production of ROS in A2780 cells. Furthermore, all the new compounds are able to overcome the cisplatin resistance in A2780cisR cells. In addition, some of the metal complexes effectively inhibit angiogenesis in the human umbilical vein endothelial cell line EA.hy926 at 0.5 muM, the ruthenium derivatives 3g (Ph) and 3d (CF3) being the best performers.

Consumers demand safer food and this is often associated with elevated cleaning costs and high environmental impacts in order to reduce contaminations on equipment and products. Modified surfaces are seen as a promising strategy for biofouling mitigation and contamination prevention. In this work, the performance of a modified Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) surface designated by SICON (R) (a-C:H:Si:O) was compared with stainless steel (316L) regarding bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation and cleanability. Assays were performed at different temperatures using Escherichia coli, one of the most persistent foodborne microorganisms and also the natural flora present in the water from an industrial salad washing line. Bacterial adhesion on SICON (R) and stainless steel were similar and favored at a higher temperature (30 degrees C). Biofilm formation was reduced on SICON (R) (1-2 Log) and this may be explained by the lower ratio between the Lifshitz-van der Waals apolar component and the electron donor component (gamma(LW)/gamma(-)) of this surface. It was also shown that after performing a cleaning treatment with chlorine, reduction of viability counts was much higher in SICON (R) (about 3.5 Log reduction and 15% removal) when compared to stainless steel (1.6 Log reduction and 6% removal). Additionally, it was observed that 18 h after treatment, biofilm values in SICON (R) were similar to those obtained with stainless steel. Results indicate that for industries with cleaning frequencies of up to 6 h, the use of SICON (R) on critical areas enables operation at a much higher hygienic level.

Case isolates from the two states had matching pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. Independent case-control studies linked infections in each outbreak with eating alfalfa sprouts that were traced to the same seed distributor. The Colorado sprouter reportedly complied with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sprout guidance, whereas the Minnesota sprouter did not. These investigations revealed that increased compliance with existing FDA guidance is needed and that additional research is needed to improve the alfalfa seed decontamination process. This reaffirms the FDA recommendation that raw alfalfa sprouts should be considered potentially contaminated and avoided by persons at high-risk such as the elderly, young children, and immunocompromised persons. PFGE played an essential role in linking these two temporally and geographically distinct E. coli O157 outbreaks.", "label": 0}
{"id": "3001", "title": "Disinfection of football protective equipment using chlorine dioxide produced by the ICA TriNova system", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus outbreaks have occurred in individuals engaged in athletic activities such as wrestling and football. Potential disease reduction interventions include the reduction or elimination of bacteria on common use items such as equipment. Chlorine dioxide has a long history of use as a disinfectant. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the ability of novel portable chlorine dioxide generation devices to eliminate bacteria contamination of helmets and pads used by individuals engaged in football. METHODS: In field studies, the number of bacteria associated with heavily used football helmets and shoulder pads was determined before and after overnight treatment with chlorine dioxide gas. Bacteria were recovered using cotton swabs and plated onto trypticase soy agar plates. In laboratory studies, Staphylococcus aureus was applied directly to pads. The penetration of bacteria into the pads was determined by inoculating agar plates with portions of the pads taken from the different layers of padding. The ability to eliminate bacteria on the pad surface and underlying foam layers after treatment with chlorine dioxide was also determined. RESULTS: Rates of recovery of bacteria after treatment clearly demonstrated that chlorine dioxide significantly (p < 0.001) reduce and eliminated bacteria found on the surface of pads. For example, the soft surface of shoulder pads from a university averaged 2.7 x 10(3) recoverable bacteria colonies before chlorine dioxide treatment and 1.3 x 102 recoverable colonies after treatment. In addition, the gas was capable of penetrating the mesh surface layer and killing bacteria in the underlying foam pad layers. Here, 7 x 10(3) to 4.5 x 10(3) laboratory applied S. aureus colonies were recovered from underlying layers before treatment and 0 colonies were present after treatment. Both naturally occurring bacteria and S. aureus were susceptible to the treatment process. CONCLUSION: Results of this study have shown that chlorine dioxide can easily and safely be used to eliminate bacteria contamination of protective pads used by football players. This could serve to reduce exposure to potential pathogens such as the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus among this group of individuals.", "label": 0}

The formation of DBPs from synthetic humic acid (HA) water and three natural surface waters containing low bromide levels (11-27g/L) was comparatively examined in the FC-based (single FC, sequential ClO2-FC, and simultaneous ClO2/FC) and MCA-based (single MCA, ClO2-MCA, and ClO2/MCA) disinfection processes. The results showed that much more DBPs were formed from the synthetic HA water than from the three natural surface waters with comparative levels of dissolved organic carbon. In the FC-based processes, ClO2 oxidation could reduce trihalomethanes (THMs) by 27-35% and haloacetic acids (HAAs) by 14-22% in the three natural surface waters, but increased THMs by 19% and HAAs by 31% in the synthetic HA water after an FC contact time of 48h. In the MCA-based processes, similar trends were observed although DBPs were produced at a much lower level. There was an insignificant difference in DBPs formation between the sequential and simultaneous processes. The presence of a high level of bromide (320g/L) remarkably promoted the DBPs formation in the FC-based processes. Therefore, the simultaneous disinfection process of ClO2/MCA is recommended particularly for waters with a high bromide level.", "label": 0}

Their properties for cellular ODN delivery were determined using fluorescently labeled ODNs (F-ODNs). Cationic lipids with hydrocarbon chains esterified to non-glycerol backbones in non-vicinal configuration were completely ineffective in nuclear ODN-delivery. Instead, an increased cytoplasmic localization of F-ODNs was observed. Cationic lipids equipped with only one hydrocarbon were completely incompetent for cellular ODN delivery. In the absence of serum, all cationic lipids tested with hydrocarbon chains in vicinal configuration esterified to a glycerol backbone (the respective N-(1,2-diacyl-dihydroxypropyl)-N,N,N-trimethyl-ammoniumchlorides or N-(1,2-diacyl-dihydroxypropyl)-N(hydroxyethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-ammoniumchlorides as well as N-(1,2-diacyl-dihydroxypropyl)-N(1,2-dihydroxypropyl)-N,N-dimethyl- ammoniumchlorides with lauroyl, myristoyl, palmitoyl, stearoyl and erucoyl chains) were able to transfect cells when combined with DOPE (20-80% nuclear fluorescence). Remarkably, only the analog esterified with two myristoyl chains was equally effective even in the absence of DOPE. By adding hydroxy groups to the N-alkyl residue, TE under serum conditions was improved yielding transfection rates of 55%, 75% and 90% for 0, 1 or 2 substituted hydroxy groups, respectively. For plasmid DNA, different requirements were identified. Again, the analog with two myristoyl chains was most effective but only in the presence of DOPE.

It is formed by the halogen substitution and oxidation reactions of chlorine with naturally occurring organic matter (e.g., humic or fulvic acids) in water containing bromide. Bromodichloromethane has been shown to be carcinogenic at multiple sites in rats (large intestine and kidney) and in mice (liver and kidney) after administration by gavage in corn oil. To further characterize its dose-response relationships for evaluations of human risk, bromodichloromethane was nominated to the NTP by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice by drinking water exposure. Male F344/N rats and female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to bromodichloromethane (greater than 98% pure) in drinking water for 3 weeks or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, mouse bone marrow cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 3-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male F344/N rats were exposed to target concentrations of 0, 43.7, 87.5, 175, 350, or 700 mg/L bromodichloromethane (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 0, 6, 12, 20, 38, or 71 mg bromodichloromethane/kg body weight) in drinking water for 3 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study. The mean body weight gains of 350 and 700 mg/L rats were significantly less than that of the controls. Concentration-related decreases in water consumption were evident during the first week on study. Relative kidney weights of rats in the 175, 350, and 700 mg/L groups were significantly greater than that of the controls. There were no significant chemical-related histopathological changes. 3-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to target concentrations of 0, 43.7, 87.5, 175, 350, or 700 mg/L bromodichloromethane (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 0, 6, 10, 16, 29 or 51 mg/kg) in drinking water for 3 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. Final mean body weights of the 175, 350, and 700 mg/L mice and mean body weight gains of 350 and 700 mg/L mice were significantly less than those of the controls. These decreases were attributed to decreased water consumption. There were significant concentration-related decreases in water consumption by groups exposed to 87.5 mg/L or greater throughout the study; these decreases were attributed to poor palatability of the dosed water. Relative liver, kidney, and thymus weights of mice in the 350 and 700 mg/L groups were significantly greater than those of the controls. Absolute lung weights of mice in the 350 and 750 mg/L groups were significantly less than that of the controls. There were no significant chemical-related histopathological changes. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male F344/N rats were exposed to target concentrations of 0, 175, 350, or 700 mg/L bromodichloromethane (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 0, 6, 12, or 25 mg/kg) in drinking water for 2 years. Survival of exposed groups was similar to that of the controls. Mean body weights of all exposed groups were generally similar to those of the controls throughout the study. Water consumption by exposed rats was less than that by the controls throughout the study; the decreases were attributed to poor palatability of the dosed water. There were no increased incidences of neoplasms that were attributed to bromodichloromethane. The incidences of chronic inflammation in the liver of the 350 and 700 mg/L groups were significantly greater than that in the controls; however, the biological significance of these increases is uncertain. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to target concentrations of 0, 175, 350, 700 mg/L bromodichloromethane (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 9, 18, or 36 mg/kg) in drinking water for 2 years. Survival of exposed groups was similar to that of the controls. Mean body weights of all exposed groups were generally less than those of the controls from week 4 through the end of the study. Water consumption by exposed mice was less than that by the controls throughout the study; the decreases were attributed to poor palatability of the dosed water. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) occurred with a negative trend, and the incidence in the 700 mg/L group was significantly decreased relative to the control group. The incidence of hemangiosarcoma in all organs was significantly decreased in the 350 mg/L group. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: The results of in vitro mutagenicity tests with bromodichloromethane were mixed. Bromodichloromethane did not induce mutations in any of several tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium, with or without exogenous metabolic activation (S9 liver enzymes). In contrast to the negative results in Salmonella, tests for mutation induction in mouse lymphoma L5178Y/tk(+/-)cells were positive in the presence of induced rat liver S9; no mutagenic activity occurred in tests conducted without S9. In cytogenetic tests with cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, bromodichloromethane induced a small increase in sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in one of four trials conducted in the presence of induced rat liver S9 enzymes; no significant increase in SCEs occurred without S9, and no induction of chromosomal aberrations occurred in bromodichloromethane-treated Chinese hamster ovary cells with or without S9. Results of in vivo tests for chromosomal damage were negative. No increases in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes were seen in bone marrow of male B6C3F1 mice administered bromodichloromethane by intraperitoneal injection for 3 days. In addition, no induction of micronuclei was observed in circulating erythrocytes of female B6C3F1 mice administered up to 700 mg/L bromodichloromethane in drinking water for 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this 2-year drinking water study, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of bromodichloromethane in male F344/N rats exposed to target concentrations of 175, 350, or 700 mg/L. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of bromodichloromethane in female B6C3F1 mice exposed to target concentrations of 175, 350, or 700 mg/L.", "label": 0}

Organisms causing these infections can be sourced from the inanimate environment around a patient. Could the difficulty in eradicating these organisms from the environment be because they reside in dry surface biofilms? AIM: The intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary referral hospital was decommissioned and the opportunity to destructively sample clinical surfaces was taken in order to investigate whether multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) had survived the decommissioning process and whether they were present in biofilms. METHODS: The ICU had two 'terminal cleans' with 500 ppm free chlorine solution; items from bedding, surrounds, and furnishings were then sampled with cutting implements. Sections were sonicated in tryptone soya broth and inoculated on to chromogenic plates to demonstrate MDROs, which were confirmed with the Vitek2 system. Genomic DNA was extracted directly from ICU samples, and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for femA to detect Staphylococcus aureus and the microbiome by bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed on environmental samples. FINDINGS: Multidrug-resistant bacteria were cultured from 52% (23/44) of samples cultured. S. aureus PCR was positive in 50%. Biofilm was demonstrated in 93% (41/44) of samples by CLSM and/or SEM. Pyrosequencing demonstrated that the biofilms were polymicrobial and contained species that had multidrug-resistant strains. CONCLUSION: Dry surface biofilms containing MDROs are found on ICU surfaces despite terminal cleaning with chlorine solution. How these arise and how they might be removed requires further study.", "label": 0}

To test the hypothesis that such antibodies could be elicited by HIV envelope glycoproteins (Envs) with unusual immunogenic properties and to identify novel bcnAbs, we used a soluble Env ectodomain (gp140) from a donor (R2) with high level of bcnAbs as an antigen for panning of an immune phage-displayed antibody library. The panning with the R2 Env resulted in significantly higher number of cross-reactive antibody clones than by using Envs from two other isolates (89.6 and IIIB). Two of the identified human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs), m22 and m24, had sequences, neutralizing and binding activities similar or identical to those of the gp120-specific bcnAbs m18 and m14. The use of the R2 Env but not other Envs for panning resulted in the identification of a novel gp41-specific hmAb, m46. For several of the tested HIV-1 primary isolates its potency on molar basis was comparable to that of T20. It inhibited entry of primary isolates from different clades with an increased activity for cell lines with low CCR5 surface concentrations. The m46 neutralizing activity against a panel of clade C isolates was significantly higher in an assay based on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (4 out of 5 isolates were neutralized with an IC50 in the range from 1.5 to 25\u00a0?g/ml) than in an assay based on a cell line with relatively high concentration of cell-surface-associated CCR5. In contrast to 2F5 and Z13, this antibody did not bind to denatured gp140 and gp41-derived peptides indicating a conformational nature of its epitope. It bound to a 5-helix bundle but not to N-heptad repeat coiled coils and a 6-helix bundle construct indicating contribution of both gp41 heptad repeats to its epitope and to a possible mechanism of neutralization. These results indicate that the R2 Env may contain unique exposed conserved epitopes that could contribute to its ability to elicit broadly cross-reactive antibodies in animals and humans; the newly identified antibodies may help in the development of novel vaccine immunogens and therapeutics.", "label": 0}

Glycopeptides are biosynthesized by a Non Ribosomal Peptide Synthase (NRPS) and the resulting peptide precursors are decorated by several tailoring enzymes, such as halogenases and glycosyltransferases. These enzymes are important targets of protein engineering to produce new derivatives of known antibiotics. Herein we show the production of two putative halogenases, denominated Stal and StaK, involved in the biosynthesis of the glycopeptide A47,934 in Streptomyces toyocaensis NRRL 15,009. This antibiotic together with the compound UK-68,597 are the unique glycopeptides which have two putative halogenases identified in their gene clusters and three chloride substituent atoms attached to their aglycones. Stal and StaK were successfully produced in E. coli in the soluble fraction with high purity using the wild type gene for Stal and a synthetic codon optimized gene for StaK. We have purified both enzymes by two chromatographic steps and a good yield was obtained. These putative halogenases were co-purified with the co-factor FAD, which are differently reduced by the enzyme SsuE in vitro. We have further confirmed that these putative halogenases are monomeric using a calibrated gel filtration column and through circular dichroism, we confirmed that both enzymes are folded with a predominance of alpha-helices.

{"id": "3633", "title": "A brief history of heat, chemical and radiation preservation and disinfection", "abstract": "A survey of historical documents indicates that some notions of disinfection, sterilization and preservation procedures were known from ancient times. These documents included explorers' accounts of the lifestyle of cultures without a written history. Although the discoveries were empirical, they were based on shrewd observation. Eighteenth and nineteenth century landmarks in the use of disinfection, sterilization and preservation techniques include a patent for the use of tar to preserve ships' timbers granted in 1716. Eau de Javel, the first hypochlorite, was described in 1774, and a food sterilization process, appertization, was invented in 1810. In the field of radiation sterilization it is surprising that within one or two years after the discovery of radioactivity, 1879, and X-rays, 1895, these phenomena were being examined for their effect on micro-organisms and were found to be lethal. The component of light which was lethal was found to reside in the ultra-violet region of the spectrum. This was published in 1903. Thus the ideas which gave rise to ultra-violet sterilization, 60Co radiation and particle accelerated sterilization were known by the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries. A seminal paper on disinfection dynamics appeared in 1897. Mode of action studies made a serious start at the beginning of this century.", "label": 1}

Cell movements were recorded by video microscopy at speeds up to 500 frames/s. The hypothesis that cells near a standing wave pressure node might be stressed by the microbubble products of sonicated contrast agent was examined. In the absence of contrast agent, cells moved rapidly to form an aggregate in the standing wave pressure node plane. First subharmonic and second harmonic emissions were detected from cell-contrast agent suspensions immediately on exposure to a threshold peak pressure amplitude of 0.98 MPa. Emissions at 3fo/2 occurred at 1.47 MPa, whereas white noise and lower-order subharmonic emissions coincided with the appearance of visible bubbles at a threshold of approximately 1.96 MPa. Cells exposed together with contrast agent at a pressure of 0.98 MPa precessed very rapidly about the pressure node plane. This behavior was discussed in the context of a recent analysis predicting that, in contrast to the situation for lower-pressure amplitudes, subresonant size bubbles translate about pressure node plane if the driving pressure amplitude is sufficiently high. Many precessing erythrocytes were clearly spiculated and this morphology persisted after the cells had left the area of precession. Hemoglobin release was significant under conditions inducing precession with first subharmonic and first harmonic emissions. Protein release increased discontinuously near the pressure thresholds, where more complex categories of frequency emission were detected. The potential of this system, which induces erythrocyte morphology changes and some protein release at the first emission threshold, to provide some control on the membrane-permeabilizing stress experienced by cells in a cavitation field is discussed.

In this study, we characterized water quality in one study zone with continuous supply and three zones with intermittent supply in the drinking water distribution network in Arraijan, Panama. Low or zero pressures occurred in all zones, and negative pressures occurred in the continuous zone and two of the intermittent zones. Despite hydraulic conditions that created risks for backflow and contaminant intrusion, only four of 423 (0.9%) grab samples collected at random times were positive for total coliform bacteria and only one was positive for E. coli. Only nine of 496 (1.8%) samples had turbidity >1.0 NTU and all samples had >/=0.2 mg/L free chlorine residual. In contrast, water quality was often degraded during the first-flush period (when supply first returned after an outage). Still, routine and first-flush water quality under intermittent supply was much better in Arraijan than that reported in a previous study conducted in India. Better water quality in Arraijan could be due to better water quality leaving the treatment plant, shorter supply outages, higher supply pressures, a more consistent and higher chlorine residual, and fewer contaminant sources near pipes. The results illustrate that intermittent supply and its effects on water quality can vary greatly between and within distribution networks. The study also demonstrated that monitoring techniques designed specifically for intermittent supply, such as continuous pressure monitoring and sampling the first flush, can detect water quality threats and degradation that would not likely be detected with conventional monitoring.", "label": 0}

AEW with a pH of 4.47 reduced the total bacterial, coliform, and yeast and mold counts on mung bean sprouts by 1.23, 1.42 and 1.25 log CFU/g, respectively. The efficacy of AEW increased with increasing ACC, and further studies showed that its antimicrobial ability was based on a combination of pH and ACC values. Cleaning using ultrasonic waves enhanced the antimicrobial activity of electrolyzed water, achieving reduction of 2.46, 2.13 and 2.92 log CFU/g for total bacterial, yeast and mold, and coliform counts, respectively.

The C. perfringens spore counts on mCP agar were significantly lower (P&lt;0.05) than the corresponding values of TSC, TSCF, SPS, and WB media. No statistically significant differences were found between C. perfringens spore counts on TSCF compared with those of other methods used. On the other hand, the identification of typical and atypical colonies isolated from all media demonstrated that fluorogenic TSC agar was the most specific medium for C. perfringens spore recovery in groundwater samples. Additionally, the results obtained indicate that mCP agar, which is the reference method in the European Union, is not suitable medium for recovering C. perfringens spores from groundwater samples.", "label": 0}

The piperazine ring of CIP was destroyed by chlorination. Among of CIP-CPs, by the bacterial role, 7.63% of the derivative with two carboxylic groups went through decarboxylation to form desethylene ciprofloxacin, and then loss of C2H5N group generated aniline compound. Furthermore, 12.3% of the aniline compound, 7.60% of chlorinated aniline compound and 1.35% of defluorinated product were bio-mineralized. Therefore, the chlorine and bacteria played synergistic effects on transformation of CIP-CPs in DWDSs, contributing to the obvious decrease of genotoxicity in effluents. Correspondingly, the TEQ4-NQO decreased from 667mug/L to 9.41mug/L. However, compared with DWDSs without CIP-CPs, the relative abundance of mexA and qnrS increased 1-fold in effluents and the relative abundance of qnrA and qnrB increased 3-fold in biofilms in DWDSs with CIP-CPs. mexA and qnrS positively correlated with Hyphomicrobium, Sphingomonas and Novosphingobium (p<0.05), while qnrA and qnrB positively correlated with Shewanella and Helicobacter (p<0.05), indicating the increase of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) came from the growth of these bacterial genera by transformation of CIP-CPs in DWDSs. These results suggested that biotransformation of antibiotics might increase ARGs risk in DWDSs.", "label": 0}
{"id": "1973", "title": "Electrochemical treatment of penicillin, cephalosporin, and fluoroquinolone antibiotics via active chlorine: evaluation of antimicrobial activity, toxicity, matrix, and their correlation with the degradation pathways", "abstract": "Antibiotics are pharmaceuticals widely consumed and frequently detected in environmental water, where they can induce toxic effects and development of resistant bacteria. Their structural variety makes the problem of antibiotics in natural water more complex. In this work, six highly used antibiotics (at 40 mumol L(-1)) belonging to three different classes (penicillins, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones) were treated using an electrochemical system with a Ti/IrO2 anode and a Zr cathode in the presence of NaCl (0.05 mumol L(-1)). The attack of electrogenerated active chlorine was found to be the main degradation route. After only 20 min of treatment, the process decreased more than 90% of the initial concentration of antibiotics, following the degradation order: fluoroquinolones > penicillins > cephalosporins. The primary interactions of the degrading agent with fluoroquinolones occurred at the cyclic amine (i.e., piperazyl ring) and the benzene ring. Meanwhile, the cephalosporins and penicillins were initially attacked on the beta-lactam and sulfide groups. However, the tested penicillins presented an additional reaction on the central amide. In all cases, the transformations of antibiotics led to the antimicrobial activity decreasing. On the contrary, the toxicity level showed diverse results: increasing, decreasing, and no change, depending on the antibiotic type. In fact, due to the conservation of quinolone nucleus in the fluoroquinolone by-products, the toxicity of the treated solutions remained unchanged. With penicillins, the production of chloro-phenyl-isoxazole fragments increased the toxicity level of the resultant solution. However, the opening of beta-lactam ring of cephalosporin antibiotics decreased the toxicity level of the treated solutions. Finally, the application of the treatment to synthetic hospital wastewater and seawater containing a representative antibiotic showed that the high amount of chloride ions in seawater accelerates the pollutant degradation. In contrast, the urea and ammonium presence in the hospital wastewater retarded the removal of this pharmaceutical.", "label": 0}

{"id": "3685", "title": "Platinum anticancer drugs. From serendipity to rational design", "abstract": "Summary The discovery of cis-platin was serendipitous. In 1965, Rosenberg was looking into the effects of an electric field on the growth of Escherichia\u00a0coli bacteria. He noticed that bacteria ceased to divide when placed in an electric field but what Rosenberg also observed was a 300-fold increase in the size of the bacteria. He attributed this to the fact that somehow the platinum-conducting plates were inducing cell growth but inhibiting cell division. It was later deduced that the platinum species responsible for this was cis-platin. Rosenberg hypothesized that if cis-platin could inhibit bacterial cell division it could also stop tumor cell growth. This conjecture has proven correct and has led to the introduction of cis-platin in cancer therapy. Indeed, in 1978, six years after clinical trials conducted by the NCI and Bristol-Myers-Squibb, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved cis-platin under the name of Platinol\u00ae for treating patients with metastatic testicular or ovarian cancer in combination with other drugs but also for treating bladder cancer. Bristol-Myers Squibb also licensed carboplatin, a second-generation platinum drug with fewer side effects, in 1979. Carboplatin entered the U.S. market as Paraplatin\u00ae in 1989 for initial treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in established combination with other approved chemotherapeutic agents. Numerous platin derivatives have been further developed with more or less success and the third derivative to be approved in 1994 was oxaliplatin under the name of Eloxatin\u00ae. It was the first platin-based drug to be active against metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with fluorouracil and folinic acid. The two others platin-based drugs to be approved were nedaplatin (Aqupla\u00ae) in Japan and lobaplatin in China, respectively. More recently, a strategy to overcome resistance due to interaction with thiol-containing molecules led to the synthesis of picoplatin in which one of the amines linked to Pt was replaced by a bulky methyl substituted pyridine allowing the drug more time to reach its target, DNA. On the other hand, efforts which were made to find new orally administered analog led to satraplatin bearing to axial acetate groups. Both drugs are still under clinical trials. An alternatively route to the discovery of new derivatives turns to the development of improved delivery strategies such as liposomes and polymers. Liposomal cis-platin or lipoplatin in under a phase III randomized clinical trial for patients suffering from small cell lung cancer whereas polymer-based drug, Prolindac\u2122 is currently under investigation for pretreated ovarian cancers in up to eight European centers.", "label": 0}
{"id": "8017", "title": "Which conditions promote a remanent (persistent) bactericidal activity of chlorine covers?", "abstract": "The interaction of disinfectants containing active chlorine compounds (hypochlorite, chloramine T) with skin surfaces produces a so called chlorine cover which is a true chemical transformation of the protein matrix of the outermost horny skin layer by forming covalent N-Cl bonds. Though its intensity can easily be measured, the results on its remanent (persistent) bactericidal action until now have not been described consistently. While Gottardi and Karl observed a well-defined remanent action which correlated with the cover strength in the artificially with E. coli contaminated arm, Koller, Rotter, and Gottardi were not able to prove it, neither in artificially contaminated hands nor in the case of the resident bacterial colonization. To clarify these not consistent results, the bactericidal activity of chlorine covers on transient (dry contamination of the finger tips with Micrococcus luteus) as well as on resident colonization (after wearing gloves for 3 h) has been re-investigated using contact plates for recovering the bacteria. The results are showing that the remanent bactericidal action of chlorine covers strongly depends on the skin milieu, with moist conditions caused by sweat (surgical gloves) favoring the bactericidal activity. Elution experiments prove that protein constituents (detected by UV-spectrometry) continuously are transported to the skin-surface. It is obvious that the latter equilibrate with the chlorine cover by forming bactericidal N-Cl compounds with the effect that oxidation capacity fixed at the protein matrix is mobilized enabling the remanent bactericidal action.", "label": 0}

It also affects other quality indices aiming at enhancing the shelf life of the product. The more mild the processes, the less their effect on the nutritional value of the products. A series of advanced physical technologies (e.g., plasma, pulsed electric field) have been proposed the past years but their further up-scaling and industrial application requires a better understanding of their antimicrobial mechanisms of action and their efficacy in controlling food safety. Radio frequency identification and time-temperature integrator devices can be used to monitor and log the temperature of foods during distribution and storage.

Whilst arabinans have been reported to be abundant polymers in the cell walls of seeds from a range of plant species, their proposed role as a storage reserve has not been thoroughly investigated. In the cell walls of Arabidopsis seeds, arabinose accounts for approximately 40% of the monosaccharide composition of non-cellulosic polysaccharides of embryos. Arabinose levels decline to ?15% during seedling establishment, indicating that cell wall arabinans may be mobilized during germination. Immunolocalization of arabinan in embryos, seeds, and seedlings reveals that arabinans accumulate in developing and mature embryos, but disappear during germination and seedling establishment. Experiments using 14C-arabinose show that it is readily incorporated and metabolized in growing seedlings, indicating an active catabolic pathway for this sugar. We found that depleting arabinans in seeds using a fungal arabinanase causes delayed seedling growth, lending support to the hypothesis that these polymers may help fuel early seedling growth.", "label": 0}

{"id": "5213", "title": "Leptospiral Nephropathy", "abstract": "Summary Leptospirosis is recognized as a globally re-emerging zoonosis. Interstitial nephritis is the principal feature of the disease. Leptospirosis-induced acute kidney injury typically is nonoliguric and includes hypokalemia. Tubular function alterations precede a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, which could explain the high frequency of hypokalemia. Studies in human beings and animals have shown increased urinary fractional excretion of potassium and sodium, as well as an increased potassium/sodium ratio, suggesting increased distal potassium secretion caused by increased distal sodium delivery consequent to functional impairment of proximal sodium reabsorption. Confirming these findings, Western blot studies have shown lower renal expression of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 and of aquaporin 2, together with higher renal expression of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC2, in infected animals. The severe form (Weil's disease) manifests as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or a combination of these features, accompanied by acute kidney injury and can be highly lethal. Antibiotic treatment is efficient in the early and late/severe phases. For critically ill leptospirosis patients, the following are recommended: daily hemodialysis, low daily net fluid intake (because of the risk for pulmonary hemorrhage), and lung-protective strategies (low tidal volumes and high positive end-expiratory pressures after recruitment maneuvers).", "label": 0}

Although there are neural stem cells present in adults, the ability of both the peripheral and central nervous system for self-repair is limited at best. As such, there is a great need for a tissue engineering approach to solve nervous system disorders and diseases. In this study, we have developed elec. conductive surfaces with controlled arrays of high aspect ratio nanowires for the growth and maintenance of neural stem cells. The nanowire surfaces were fabricated from polycaprolactone using a novel nanotemplating technique, and were coated with an elec. conductive polymer, polypyrrole. The polypyrrole-coated nanowire surfaces were characterized using SEM and XPS. Addnl., the surface resistance of polypyrrole-coated nanowire surfaces was measured. C17.2 neural stem cells were used to evaluate the efficacy of the polypyrrole-coated nanowire surfaces to promote cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. The results presented here indicate significantly higher cellular adhesion and proliferation on polypyrrole-coated nanowire surfaces as compared to control surfaces. The differentiation potential of polypyrrole nanowire surfaces was also evaluated by immunostaining key neuronal markers that are expressed when NSCs differentiate into their resp. neural lineages.

Harvesting and processing cause plant tissue damage. In order to assess the role of plant tissue damage in the contamination of leafy greens with E. coli O157:H7, the effect of mechanical, physiological, and plant disease-induced lesions on the growth of this pathogen on postharvest romaine lettuce was investigated. Within only 4 h after inoculation, the population sizes of E. coli O157:H7 increased 4.0-, 4.5-, and 11.0-fold on lettuce leaves that were mechanically bruised, cut into large pieces, and shredded into multiple pieces, respectively. During the same time, E. coli O157:H7 population sizes increased only twofold on leaves that were left intact after harvest. Also, the population size of E. coli O157:H7 was 27 times greater on young leaves affected by soft rot due to infection by Erwinia chrysanthemi than on healthy middle-aged leaves. Confocal microscopy revealed that leaf tip burn lesions, which are caused by a common physiological disorder of lettuce, harbored dense populations of E. coli O157:H7 cells both internally and externally. Investigation of the colonization of cut lettuce stems by E. coli O157: H7 showed that the pathogen grew 11-fold over 4 h of incubation after its inoculation onto the stems, from which large amounts of latex were released. The results of this study indicate that plant tissue damage of various types can promote significant multiplication of E. coli O157:H7 over a short time and suggest that harvesting and processing are critical control points in the prevention or reduction of E. coli O157:H7 contamination of lettuce.", "label": 0}

The tolerability of the less aggressive N-chlorotaurine (NCT), an endogenous compound also produced in vivo by stimulated human granulocytes, could be superior. OBJECTIVES: To assess the tolerability and efficacy of NCT in the cleaning of purulent coatings in chronic leg ulcers in comparison with CAT. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized phase IIb clinical study 40 patients were treated for a median of 7 days (range 3-14) with a 1% aqueous solution of either NCT (20 subjects) or CAT (20 subjects) by twice-daily application of dressings soaked in the test solutions. Criteria for evaluation of tolerability were intensity and duration of pain caused by the ulcer therapy and scores of tissue toxicity (necrosis, granulation tissue and re-epithelialization). Therapeutic efficacy was graded as scores of intensity of purulent coating of the ulcers. RESULTS: The concentration tolerated in vitro by human epidermoid carcinoma cells was at least 10-fold higher for NCT (0.01%) compared with CAT (0.0001-0.001%). There was significantly less pain caused by NCT compared with CAT (P < 0.05) on days 1 and 4 and a trend for a shorter duration of pain (P = 0.093). The scores of intensity of coating improved without difference in both treatment groups, whereas granulation and re-epithelialization appeared earlier in the NCT group (P < 0.05). Non-quantitative microbiological cultures from ulcer smears revealed persistence of colonization by bacterial species in approximately half of both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both active chlorine compounds were helpful in reducing purulent coatings. Because of its lower toxicity and better tolerability, NCT is of advantage in the treatment of leg ulcers.", "label": 0}

Such compounds are either detoxicated directly via phase I metabolism or detoxicated by phase II metabolism of metabolites as formed by microsomal monooxygenases. Here we used monochlorobimane (MCB) as an artificial substrate and glutathione to determine total GST activity in equivalents of single pest insects and spider mites in a sensitive 96-well plate-based assay system by measuring the enzymatic conversion of MCB to its fluorescent bimane-glutathione adduct. The differentiation by their GST activity between several strains of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae), with different degrees of resistance to numerous acaricides was more sensitive with MCB compared to the commonly used substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). Compared to an acaricide-susceptible reference strain, one field population of T. urticae showed a more than 10-fold higher GST activity measured with MCB, in contrast to a less than 2-fold higher activity when CDNB was used. Furthermore, we showed that GST activity can be sensitively assessed with MCB in homogenates of pest insects such as Heliothis virescens, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae), and Myzus persicae (Hemiptera: Aphididae). \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).", "label": 0}

{"id": "9050", "title": "Sixty years research with characean cells: fascinating material for plant cell biology", "abstract": "A review. My nearly 60-yr long and deeply rewarding research life can be divided into three periods, the first between 1952 and 1977 at Osaka University, the second between 1977 and 1990 at the University of Tokyo, and the third between 1990 and 2002 at the Fukui University of Technol. Throughout my research life, my main exptl. material has been the internodal cells of the characean algae, Nitella, Chara, Nitellopsis, as well as the internodal cells of the brackish genus Lamprothamnium. The characean internodal cell is a giant cylindrical cell that is typically 50-100 mm in length and 0.5-1.0 mm in diam. (cf. my picture). The cell is characterized by a very active rotational cytoplasmic streaming with an unusually high speed amounting to 50-70 ?m s-1 at 25\u00b0C as well as an exceptionally large action potential (150 mV), which can be generated by elec., mech., and chem. stimuli. Due to these activities, the characean cell is often referred to the \"green muscle\" or the \"green axon.\". Professor Noburo Kamiya, my mentor throughout my research in the undergraduate (1952-1953) and graduate course (1953-1955) at the Biol. Department of Osaka University, was already well-known for his famous work on cytoplasmic streaming in the plasmodium of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. In 1940, he invented the so-called double-chamber method to measure the motive force of cytoplasmic streaming in Physarum. This simple yet elegant method allowed him to measure the motive force by controlling cytoplasmic streaming with air pressure. Professor Kamiya's ingenious gift to develop new methods and instrumentation extended to the study of cytoplasmic streaming in characean cells. Under the influence of Professor Kamiya, my research on characean cells is characterized by the development of new methods. In 1964, I developed a perfusion technique to make cells that contain artificial cell saps so that the compn. of the vacuole could be exptl. controlled. In 1976, I developed a method based on perfusion for removing the tonoplast of characean cells so that the compn. of the cytosol could also be exptl. controlled. My daily exposure to cell surgeries in the Kamiya lab., such as the cutting and ligation of internodal cells, was inspirational in helping me to develop these intracellular perfusion techniques. I learned from my mentor in Osaka that science is driven forward by the combination of a new idea with a new method. With this thought etched in my mind, I moved in 1977 from Osaka University to the University of Tokyo where I chaired the Lab. of Plant Physiol. in the Botany Department. Here we took advantage of vacuolar perfusion and tonoplast-free cells to study the electrogenic ion pump, membrane excitation, cell motility, turgor regulation, salt tolerance, various vacuolar activities, including pH regulation, and protein degrdn., as well as the intercellular transport of photoassimilates.

Within the systems evaluated, the most promising compounds contained either an ?- or ?-hydroxy-carbonyl motif within their structure (e.g., 8 and 9). Efficacious substituents were identified and used to design new HIV inhibitors with increased potency and lower cytotoxicity. Of the scaffolds evaluated, specific chalcones were found to provide the best balance between anti-HIV potency and low host cell toxicity. Chalcone 8l was shown to inhibit different clinical isolates of HIV in a dose-dependent manner (e.g., IC50 typically  | ? |  5  | ?M). Inhibition of HIV infection experiments using TZM-bl cells demonstrated that chalcone 8l and flavonol 9c had IC50 values of 4.7 ?M and 10.4 ?M, respectively. These insights were used to design new chalcones 8o and 8p. Rewardingly, chalcones 8o and 8p (at 10 ?M) each gave &gt;92% inhibition of v | iral propagation without impacting PM1 host cell viability. Inhibition of viral propagation significantly increased (60\u201390%) when PM1 cells were pre-incubated with chalcone 8o, but not with the related flavonol 9c. These results suggested that chalcone 8o may be of value as both a HIV prophylactic and therapy.

Using 28 water samples from seven sites, we report the first integrated mutagenicity and comprehensive analytical chemistry of spas treated with chlorine, bromine, or ozone, along with pools treated with these same disinfectants. Gas chromatography (GC) with high-resolution mass spectrometry, membrane-introduction mass spectrometry, and GC-electron capture detection were used to comprehensively identify and quantify DBPs and other contaminants. Mutagenicity was assessed by the Salmonella mutagenicity assay. More than 100 DBPs were identified, including a new class of DBPs, bromoimidazoles.

Pool and spa samples were 2.4 and 4.1x more mutagenic, respectively, than corresponding tap waters. The concentration of the sum of 21 DBPs measured quantitatively increased from finished to tap to pool to spa; and mutagenic potency increased from finished/tap to pools to spas. Mutagenic potencies of samples from a chlorinated site correlated best with brominated haloacetic acid concentrations (Br-HAAs) (r = 0.98) and nitrogen-containing DBPs (N-DBPs) (r = 0.97) and the least with Br-trihalomethanes (r = 0.29) and Br-N-DBPs (r = 0.04). The mutagenic potencies of samples from a brominated site correlated best (r = 0.82) with the concentrations of the nine HAAs, Br-HAAs, and Br-DBPs. Human use increased significantly the DBP concentrations and mutagenic potencies for most pools and spas. These data provide evidence that human precursors can increase mutagenic potencies of pools and spas and that this increase is associated with increased DBP concentrations.", "label": 0}

These challenges have become important goals of process chemistry and have steadily stimulated the search of impurities after accelerated or forced degradation procedures. As a result, impurity profiling is one of the most attractive, active and relevant fields of modern pharmaceutical analysis. This activity includes the identification, structural elucidation and quantitative determination of impurities and degradation products in bulk drugs and their pharmaceutical formulations. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has evolved into an irreplaceable approach for pharmaceutical quality assessment, currently playing a critical role in unequivocal structure identification as well as structural confirmation (qualitative detection), enabling the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the formation of process and/or degradation impurities. NMR is able to provide qualitative information without the need of standards of the unknown compounds and multiple components can be quantified in a complex sample without previous separation. When coupled to separative techniques, the resulting hyphenated methodologies enhance the analytical power of this spectroscopy to previously unknown levels. As a result, and by enabling the implementation of rational decisions regarding the identity and level of impurities, NMR contributes to the goal of making better and safer medicines.

This effect was maximal for Pluronics F127 and P85 with intermediate hydrophobicity, while more hydrophilic F68 and more hydrophobic L61 were less effective. Pluronic effect on the photocatalytic activity of tetraphenylporphyrin and dimegine is attributed to their disaggregation in water solution, while PD activity is elevated due to the local concentrating of the photocatalyst and the substrate within micellar volume. It was found by AFM that the structure of Pluronic F127 thin films prepared by water solution evaporation on mica surface significantly changed in the presence of porphyrin.

Methods: Solutions of benzalkonium chloride, with concentrations ranging from 0%-1%, were mixed in 2.4% sodium hypochlorite and tested as follows. The wetting properties were investigated by measuring the contact angle of the solutions on a nondehydrated dentin surface by using the static sessile drop method.

The critical micellar concentration of benzalkonium chloride mixed in sodium hypochlorite was calculated from the data. When 2.4% NaOCl was mixed with benzalkonium chloride at the critical micellar concentration, 3 parameters were tested: free chloride content, cytotoxicity, and antibacterial effects against Enterococcus faecalis. Results: The contact angle (P < .001) as well as the surface energy (P < .001) significantly decreased with increasing benzalkonium chloride concentrations. The critical micellar concentration of benzalkonium chloride in sodium hypochlorite was 0.008%. At this concentration, the addition of benzalkonium chloride had no effect on the free chlorine content, cytotoxicity, or antibacterial efficiency of the mixture. Conclusions: The addition of benzalkonium chloride to sodium hypochlorite at the critical micellar concentration reduced the contact angle by 51.2% and the surface energy by 53.4%, without affecting the free chloride content, cytotoxicity, or antibacterial properties of the mixture.

The combinations included sequential (UV-H2O2, H2O2-UV) and simultaneous (UV/H2O2) processes. Results showed that B. subtilis spores achieved a certain inactivation effect through UV treatment. However, hardly any inactivation effect by H2O2 alone was obsd. H2O2 had a significant synergetic effect when combined with UV treatment, while high irradiance and H2O2 concn. both favored the reaction. When treated with 0.60 mm H2O2 and 113.0 ?W/cm2 UV irradiance for 6 min, the simultaneous UV/H2O2 treatment showed significantly improved disinfection effect (4.13 log) compared to that of UV-H2O2 (3.03 log) and H2O2-UV (2.88 log). The relationship between the inactivation effect and the exposure time followed a typical pseudo-first-order kinetics model. The pseudo-first-order rate consts. were 0.478, 0.447 and 0.634 min-1, for the UV-H2O2, H2O2-UV and UV/H2O2 processes, resp., further confirming the optimal disinfection effect of the UV/H2O2 process. The disinfection could be ascribed to the OH radicals, as verified by the level of para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA). [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

The antimicrobial activity against a Listeria innocua strain (LRGIA 01) of these textiles was assessed following a protocol based on the ISO 20743-2005 standard. The number of cultivable bacteria on textiles was then monitored for 24 h. The microbial population after 24 h at 30 \u00b0C attained 107 CFU g?1 on control textiles while it did not exceed 103 CFU g?1 on plasma-treated textile. All plasma-treated with silver textiles were anti-Listeria (up to 7 log CFU g?1 decimal reductions of L. innocua populations) and this observation was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. These textiles could thus have potential applications in food-processing industry to control cross-contaminations by L. monocytogenes.", "label": 0}

Hemes are generally considered the prime targets of CO and CORMs, so we tested this hypothesis using heme-deficient bacteria, applying cellular, transcriptomic, and biochemical tools. Results: CORM-3 [Ru(CO)<inf>3</inf>Cl(glycinate)] readily penetrated Escherichia coli hemA bacteria and was inhibitory to these and Lactococcus lactis, even though they lack all detectable hemes. Transcriptomic analyses, coupled with mathematical modeling of transcription factor activities, revealed that the response to CORM-3 in hemA bacteria is multifaceted but characterized by markedly elevated expression of iron acquisition and utilization mechanisms, global stress responses, and zinc management processes. Cell membranes are disturbed by CORM-3. Innovation: This work has demonstrated for the first time that CORM-3 (and to a lesser extent its inactivated counterpart) has multiple cellular targets other than hemes. A full understanding of the actions of CORMs is vital to understand their toxic effects. Conclusion: This work has furthered our understanding of the key targets of CORM-3 in bacteria and raises the possibility that the widely reported antimicrobial effects cannot be attributed to classical biochemical targets of CO. This is a vital step in exploiting the potential, already demonstrated, for using optimized CORMs in antimicrobial therapy.", "label": 0}

The importance of this task arises from the ubiquity of genotoxic compounds in the environment and the need to identify the sources of contamination so that efforts aimed at control and minimization can be implemented. Of even greater significance is the immediate concern for the welfare of human health and the environment. Subheadings of this document include a description of the genetic bioassays that have been used to test industrial wastes, a compendium of methods commonly used to prepare crude waste samples for bioassay, and a review of the genetic toxicity of wastes and effluents. Wastes and effluents have been grouped according to industrial source. Major categories include chemical and allied products, pulp and paper manufacturing, defense and munitions, petroleum refining, primary metal industries, and miscellaneous industrial manufactures. Within each industrial category, a synopsis of individual genetic toxicity studies is presented, followed by an interpretation of results on a comprehensive, industry-wide basis. In this evaluation, a discussion of the types and extent of genotoxic damage caused by a particular set of wastes is presented, and potential sources of genotoxic activity are identified. Concluding the document is a commentary, which discloses potential shortcomings in the way in which current legislation protects human heath and the environment from the release of genotosic substances via industrial wastes and effluents. It also provides an assessment of the genotoxic burden that industrial wastes place on the environment.", "label": 0}

(HIF-1?) and inhibited by intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, P-gp and HIF-1? expression were investigated in multicellular prostate tumor spheroids overexpressing the ROS-generating enzyme Nox-1 in comparison to the mother cell line DU-145. In Nox-1-overexpressing tumor spheroids (DU-145Nox1) generation of ROS as well as expression of Nox-1 was significantly increased as compared to DU-145 tumor spheroids. ROS generation was significantly inhibited in the presence of the NADPH-oxidase antagonists diphenylen-iodonium chloride (DPI) and 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). Albeit growth kinetic of DU-145Nox1 tumor spheroids was decreased as compared to DU-145 spheroids, elevated expression of Ki-67 was observed indicating increased cell cycle activity. In DU-145Nox1 tumor spheroids, expression of HIF-1? as well as P-gp was significantly decreased as compared to DU-145 spheroids, which resulted in an increased retention of the anticancer agent doxorubicin. Pretreatment with the free radical scavengers vitamin E and vitamin C increased the expression of P-gp as well as HIF-1? in Nox-1-overexpressing cells, whereas no effect of free radical scavengers was observed on mdr-1 mRNA expression. In summary, the data of the present study demonstrate that the development of P-gp-mediated MDR is abolished under conditions of elevated ROS levels, suggesting that the MDR phenotype can be circumvented by modest increase of intracellular ROS generation. \u00a9 2005 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

The nitrilimine was generated via chlorine abstraction from the parent hydrazonoyl chloride using silver carbonate. (D) Halogen Scavenger; C-H Oxidation Strategy: In landmark work, a C-H oxidation strategy was employed for the synthesis of eudesmane terpenes. The syntheses of two of them, dihydroxyeudesmane and pygmol, feature as key steps the selective bromination of the more reactive tertiary carbon from the isopropyl sidechain, followed by a cyclization event assisted by silver carbonate. After hydrolysis of the cyclic carbonate formed, the corresponding diol is obtained in a very selective manner.

Considerable reductions were achieved with AEW on eggs. On some food commodities, treatment with BEW followed by AEW produced higher reductions than did treatment with AEW only.

The microbicidal activity of chlorinebased disinfectants depends on the free available chlorine (FAC), but their oxidative potential is rapidly eliminated by organic matter. In this study, the microbicidal activities of weakly acidified chlorous acid water (WACAW) and sodium hypochlorite solution (NaClO) against feline calcivirus (FCV) and C. difficile spores were compared in protein-rich conditions. WACAW inactivated FCV and C. difficile spores better than NaClO under all experimental conditions used in this study. WACAW above 100 ppm FAC decreased FCV >4 log10 within 30 sec in the presence of 0.5% each of bovine serum albumin (BSA), polypeptone or meat extract. Even in the presence of 5% BSA, WACAW at 600 ppm FAC reduced FCV >4 log10 within 30 sec. Polypeptone inhibited the virucidal activity of WACAW against FCV more so than BSA or meat extract. WACAW at 200 ppm FAC decreased C. difficile spores >3 log10 within 1 min in the presence of 0.5% polypeptone. The microbicidal activity of NaClO was extensively diminished in the presence of organic matter. WACAW recovered its FAC to the initial level after partial neutralization by sodium thiosulfate, while no restoration of the FAC was observed in NaClO. These results indicate that WACAW is relatively stable under organic matter-rich conditions and therefore may be useful for treating environmental surfaces contaminated by human excretions.", "label": 1}

This arises from high pore size polydispersity and charged membrane surfaces that lead to separations affected by solute charge. Furthermore, these membranes are susceptible to fouling. Self-assembly is a promising technique for making polymeric membranes with fouling resistance, high permeability and selectivity along with opportunity for easy fabrication and scalability. We report the first examples of a new class of membrane materials that derive their permeability, size-based selectivity and fouling resistance from the self-assembly of zwitterion-containing amphiphilic random copolymers. Zwitterionic groups strongly resist biomacromolecular fouling due to their high affinity with water, and self-assemble into channel-type clusters of 0.6-2nm in size. We show that these copolymers self-assemble into bicontinuous nanodomains. Thin film composite membranes formed by coating these copolymers onto porous supports exhibit permeances as high as 8.4Lm<sup>-2</sup>h<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup>bar<sup>-1</sup>, over three times that of a commercial membrane with similar MWCO. They show size-based selectivity, with a cut-off around 1nm. This closely matches the size of zwitterionic domains measured by transmission electron microscopy, indicating permeation occurs through these self-assembled \"nanochannels.\" These membranes show excellent fouling resistance during filtration of protein solutions and oil emulsions, completely resisting irreversible fouling and retaining over 96% of their permeance during filtration. These membranes have potential uses in biomolecule separations, purification of pharmaceuticals, and wastewater treatment.", "label": 0}

The bacterial survival, chlorine lethal dose and inactivation kinetics at lethal doses were examined. Inactivation of the test bacteria (n = 20) at the recommended dose of 0.5 mg/l for 30 min exposure showed a progressive reduction in bacterial population from 4 to 5 log reduction and residuals ranged between 0.12 and 0.46 mg/l. The bactericidal activity of chlorine increased at higher dosages with a substantial reduction in viability of the bacteria and complete inactivation of the bacterial population at a lethal dose of 0.75 and 1.0 mg/l in 30 min. For the inactivation kinetics, bactericidal activity of chlorine increased with time showing a 3.67-5.4 log reduction in 10 min, 4.0-5.6 log reduction in 20 min and above 6.3 log reductions to complete sterilization of bacterial population over 30 min for all the entire test Citrobacter isolates used in this study. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation (R (2) > 0.84) between bacteria inactivation and increase in contact time. This study appears to have provided support for laboratory evidence of bacterial tolerance to chlorine disinfection at current recommended dose (0.5 mg/l for 30 min), and chlorine concentration between 0.75 and 1.0 mg/l was found to have a better disinfecting capacity to check tolerance of Citrobacter species.", "label": 1}

In this study, the amphoteric surfactant-based disinfectant (product A) that has been routinely used in catering facilities of the German Armed Forces and a peracetic acid-based disinfectant (product B) were compared for their efficacy against B. cereus spores in laboratory tests and under field conditions. In a carrier test for B. cereus spores, product A displayed no efficacy against spores of the test strain. In contrast, a substantial reduction in spore concentration (> 5-log reduction) was achieved with product B. In a controlled trial conducted in seven Army catering facilities, the reduction in the number of B. cereus-positive samples was significantly greater (P < 0.001) for product B (from 28% initial contamination to 3% after application) than for product A (from 33 to 21 %). Product B was estimated to be 6.25 times more efficacious than product A. Field trials confirmed the higher efficacy of the peracetic acid-based disinfectant to reduce B. cereus contamination on surfaces as found for the in vitro experiments.

They are transmitted by oocysts from person-to-person by the fecal-oral route or via contaminated water or food. The most common symptom of infection is diarrhea, however, asymptomatic infections occur. Infections are associated with intestinal inflammation, with pathological lesions such as villus blunting, and abnormal function such as malabsorption. Mild-to-moderate, self-limiting diarrhea is common in healthy individuals ingesting infective stages of these organisms. However, patients with immune dysfunction can have severe intestinal injury and prolonged diarrhea. Diagnosis in many cases is made by a microscopic examination of the stool, and the use of appropriate staining techniques, but more recently molecular methods for detection are used increasingly. Effective antimicrobial treatment for prolonged infection in immunocompromised patients is available for most of these infections. These gastrointestinal coccidial pathogens have important similarities in epidemiology, disease pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment. Although there are many other cyst-forming coccidia of public health, veterinary and/or economic importance, discussion in this chapter will be limited to C. cayetanensis, as an important example of the group. Aspects of the biology, epidemiology, diagnosis, disease, treatment and control are considered. This parasite is considered to be an emerging pathogen. From 1990 to 2000, there were 11 foodborne outbreaks of cyclosporosis in North America that affected at least 3600 people.

Teleost NCC recognition of DNA appeared to differ from that which occurs in higher vertebrates. NCC contain at least two different receptor specificities for DNA. Both oligodeoxyguanosine 20-mers (dG20) and 5?-TGCTGCTTGTGCTTGTGCTT-3? (4GC-2T) bound specifically to NCC. The existence of different receptor specificities was indicated by reciprocal cold target inhibition experiments. dG20 competed with 4GC-2T binding but sODNs composed of GpC or CpG nests did not compete with recognition by NCC of the dG20. ODN binding by NCC primarily depended on the presence of GpC or CpG nests with a preference for -G- serving as the anchor nucleotide. Secondarily, and similar to models of ODN activation in mammals, palindrome sequences of pu\u2013pu-CpG-py\u2013py activated NCC cytotoxicity. Additional analysis of the requirements for ODN activation indicated that guanosine could not substitute for adenosine as a purine spacer and that CpG motifs containing flanking thymidine (i.e.-GTCpGTT-) augmented the activity of the sODN containing this flanking base. Other evidence for the participation of both G and C in the recognition of specific nucleotides by NCC was that poly-dC20, dA20 or dT20 had no activating properties. Methylation of all cytosine nucleotides within an ODN abrogated activation. A canonical ODN motif of 5?-C/AT/AGCTT-3? can now be suggested for teleosts. Additional studies were done to examine the effects of in vitro treatment of NCC with bDNA. bDNA from three different disease isolates of Streptococcus iniae activated NCC cytotoxicity. Treatment of the bDNA with DNase abrogated the enhancement of cytotoxicity. Also, treatment of NCC with eukaryotic DNA had no effects on cytotoxicity. These studies suggested that NCC recognize bacterial nonmethylated DNA. The consequences of these interactions may be increased innate and acquired anti-bacterial immunity.", "label": 0}

Producers may consider three options for validating antimicrobial washing as a preventive control for cross contamination. Option 1 involves the use of a surrogate for the microbial hazard and the demonstration that cross-contamination is prevented by the antimicrobial wash. Option 2 involves the use of antimicrobial sensors and the demonstration that a critical antimicrobial level is maintained during worst-case operating conditions. Option 3 validates the placement of the sensors in the processing equipment with the demonstration that a critical antimicrobial level is maintained at all locations, regardless of operating conditions. These validation options developed for fresh-cut leafy vegetables may serve as examples for validating processes that prevent cross-contamination during washing of other fresh produce commodities.", "label": 1}

Three weeks after completion of the study, national marketing of the flocculant-disinfectant was extended into the study communities. Six months later, we assessed frequency of and characteristics associated with purchase and use of the flocculant-disinfectant by revisiting the original study households and administering a questionnaire. Four hundred sixty-two households (90%) completed the follow-up survey; 22 households (5%) purchased the flocculant-disinfectant within the preceding 2 weeks and used it within the last week. Neither being randomized to the intervention group during the efficacy study nor combined spending on laundry soap, toothpaste, and hand soap in the preceding week was associated with active repeat use. Even after efficacy was demonstrated within their community and an aggressive sophisticated marketing approach, few households purchased flocculant-disinfectant for point-of-use water treatment.", "label": 0}

As part of a prospective epidemiological study, we isolated multiple colonies of M avium from patients with AIDS and from potable water to which they had been exposed. All isolates were analysed with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). As judged by PFGE, 29 (81%) of 36 patients were infected with one or more unique clinical strains of M avium. 7 patients (19%) were infected with three groups of common strains. Group 1 included 3 patients who lived in separate rural areas and had no common exposures apart from treatment at hospital A. The same strain was isolated repeatedly during 41 months from a recirculating hot water system at hospital A; residential water cultures were negative. Group 2 included 2 patients with no common exposures apart from treatment at hospital B; the same strain was isolated repeatedly over a period of 24 months from a recirculating hot water system at hospital B. Patients in groups 1 and 2 had numerous possible exposures to hospital hot water. Group 3 included 2 patients treated at the same methadone treatment facility.

The test compounds were mutagenic without metabolic activation, although metabolic activation markedly enhanced their activity. A significant decrease in the survival of SOS defective mutants, recA and lexA of Escherichia coli was observed as compared with their wild-type counterpart in the presence of the steroids. The role of SOS repair genes gains further support from the lambda prophage induction in the lysogen and beta-galactosidase induction in the Mud strains as well as mutagenesis with Ames tester strains. Structural features which appear essential for mutagenic activity in these strains are (i) a reactive N-aminophthalamide group at the (5,6-b) position and (ii) an acetoxy/chlorine group at the third position of the steroidal nucleus. The individual moieties/groups were not mutagenic per se. These steroids appear to generate H2O2 as well as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals in the model biological system.", "label": 0}

Possible participation of this enzyme in the response of tumors to photodynamic therapy (PDT) was investigated in this study. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse FsaR tumors treated by PDT based on photosensitizers Photofrin or 5,10,15,20-tetra-(m-hydroxyphenyl)chlorine (mTHPC) revealed a strong positive staining for PARP product poly(ADP-ribose) at 30 min and 1 h after PDT, respectively, and even more intense positivity at 2 h after PDT with both photosensitizers. Flow cytometry-based examination showed the induction of poly-ADP-ribosylation in FsaR tumors at 30 min after PDT, with a trend for a further increase in the intensity by 2 h after PDT in both cancer cells and tumor-associated leukocytes. In FsaR cells treated in vitro by mTHPC-based PDT, flow cytometric analysis indicated that the activation of PARP concentrated in cells undergoing apoptosis and reached a maximum by 30 min after PDT. The administration of PARP inhibitors, 3-aminobenzamide or 1,5-isoquinolinediol, to FsaR tumor-bearing mice before PDT light treatment increased the resistance of these tumors to PDT. PARP appears to control the balance between apoptotic and necrotic cell death in PDT-treated tumors and regulate the progression of PDT-induced inflammatory or innate immune response.", "label": 0}

Red round tomatoes (11.3 kg) were dip inoculated to contain Salmonella at approximately 6 log CFU/g, air dried for 2 h, treated for 2 min in a 3.3-m-long dump tank and then dried on a roller conveyor, with sanitizer-free water serving as the control. Tomato and water samples were collected at 15-s intervals during washing with additional dump tank, water tank, and roller conveyor surface samples collected after washing. All samples were appropriately neutralized, diluted, and surface plated on Trypticase soy agar containing 0.6% yeast extract, 0.05% ferric ammonium citrate, and 0.03% sodium thiosulfate with or without membrane filtration to enumerate Salmonella. All six sanitizer treatments were more efficacious than the water control (P </= 0.05), with chlorine plus citric acid yielding the greatest Salmonella reduction on tomatoes (3.1 log CFU/g). After processing, all sanitizer wash solutions contained significantly lower (P </= 0.05) levels of Salmonella than the water control (3.0 log CFU/ml). The four chlorine-based sanitizer treatments yielded significantly lower Salmonella populations (P </= 0.05) in the wash solution compared with peroxyacetic acid and mixed peracid.

Due to the increasing prevalence noticed in westernised populations since the 1940s, particular attention should be paid to triggers, which may be contributing to this rise. Identifying a trigger is fraught with difficulty due to the fluctuating natural course of ADE. Triggers of ADE include irritants (such as soap and detergents), allergens (including standard patch test defined allergens, aeroallergens and food allergens), skin infections (such as Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, herpes simplex virus, malassezia and tinea infections) and others, including cigarette smoke exposure and psychological stress.

The bacterial survival, chlorine lethal dose and inactivation kinetics at lethal doses were examined. The bacterial isolates were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of 16S rRNA gene of bacteria with known taxa in the GenBank revealed the bacterial isolates to belong to Escherichia coli. At the recommended free chlorine of 0.5 mg/L, reduction of E. coli isolates (n = 20) initial bacterial concentration of 8.35-8.75 log was within a range of 3.88-6.0 log at chlorine residuals of 0.14-0.44 mg/L after 30 min. At higher doses, a marked reduction (p < 0.05) in the viability of E. coli isolates was achieved with a greater than 7.3 log inactivation of the bacterial population. Inactivation kinetics revealed a high rate of bacterial kill over time (R-2 > 0.9) at chlorine dose of 1.5 mg/L.

{"id": "3413", "title": "Resistance to the nitroheterocyclic drugs", "abstract": "The nitroheterocyclic drugs have been available since the early 1960's for the treatment of anaerobic protozoa. The application of these drugs has widened since then and they are presently used to treat anaerobic pathogenic bacteria and protozoa. The activity of the nitroheterocyclic drugs depends on the all-important nitro group attached to the imidazole or furan ring. Although the nitro radicals, generated by reduction of the parent drugs, are similar for both families of nitroheterocyclics, the nitroimidazoles and the nitrofurans, the electron potential of each is different and thus the mechanism of action depends on different pathways. The nitroimidazoles depend on reduction by ferredoxin or flavodoxin. The nitrofurans require nitroreductase activity, but the natural substrate of these enzymes has not been identified. Increased use of nitroheterocyclic drugs, in response to drug resistance to other commonly used antibiotics, has in turn resulted in drug resistance to a number of nitroheterocyclic drugs. Bacteroides strains and other bacteria, including Helicobacter, have developed resistance. Among the protozoa, Trichomonas has developed resistance to metronidazole via a number of mechanisms, especially a decrease in drug reduction, as a result of alterations in the electron transport pathways. Resistance to both types of nitroheterocyclic drugs has been reported in Giardia. Although resistance to these drugs is not widespread, their increased use world-wide as a prophylaxis and in chemotherapy will inevitably result in increased resistance in organisms commonly found in asymptomatic infections, including Trichomonas, Giardia and Entamoeba. However, the variety of substitutions which can be attached to the ring structures has led to a great variety of drugs being synthesised, some of which are many-fold more active than the commonly prescribed nitroheterocyclics. With careful administration of currently available drugs and continued interest in synthesising more active compounds, we can optimistically expect to have useful nitroheterocyclic drugs available for some time.", "label": 0}

The purpose of this research is to elucidate the manner in which ClO2 destroys proteins by studying the effects of ClO2 on lysozyme. The degree of enzyme activity lost can be correlated to the treatment time and levels of the ClO2 used. Lysozyme activity was drastically reduced to 45.3% of original enzyme activity when exposed to 4.3 mM ClO2 in the sample after 3 h. Almost all activities were lost in 3 h after exposure to higher ClO2 concentrations of up to 16.8 and 21.9 mM. Changes in protein conformation and amount as a result of ClO2 treatment were determined using the Raman spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis. Raman shifts and the alteration of spectral features observed in the ClO2-treated lysozyme samples are associated with loss of the alpha-helix secondary structure, tertiary structure, and disulfide bond. Progressive degradation of the denatured lysozyme by increasing levels of chlorine dioxide was also observed in gel electrophoresis. Hence, ClO2 can effectively cause protein denaturation and degradation resulting in loss of enzyme activity.", "label": 0}

One milliliter of bacteria suspension (ca. 10-11 log(10)CFU/ml) was mixed with 9ml of SAEW, strong acidic electrolyzed water (StAEW; ca. 50mg/l ACC), sodium hypochlorite solution (NaOCl; ca.120mg/l ACC) and distilled water (DW) as control and treated for 60s. SAEW effectively reduced the population of E. coli, S. aureus and Salmonella spp. by 5.1, 4.8, and 5.2 log(10)CFU/ml. Although, ACC of SAEW was more than 5 times lower than that of NaOCl solution, they showed no significant bactericidal difference (p>0.05). However, the bactericidal effect of StAEW was significantly higher (p<0.05) than SAEW and NaOCl solution in all cases. When tested with each individual test solution, E. coli, S. aureus and Salmonella spp. reductions were not significantly different (p>0.05). These findings indicate that SAEW with low available chlorine concentration can equally inactivate E. coli, S. aureus and Salmonella spp. as NaOCl solution and therefore SAEW shows a high potential of application in agriculture and food industry as an environmentally friendly disinfection agent.", "label": 1}

It presents a ranking, from simple disinfection through to sterilization, that should be considered in the reprocessing of devices, based on the risks associated with their use, ranging from \u2018critical\u2019 (presenting a high risk), through \u2018semi-critical\u2019 to \u2018non-critical\u2019 (presenting a low risk). The different levels of disinfection are based on demonstrating antimicrobial activity against established marker micro-organisms representing a range of pathogens. Although this classification system is probably as valid today as it was in 1957, the understanding of microbiology and micro-organisms has changed. This article discusses some examples of disinfection studies with viruses, bacteria, protozoa and prions that challenge the current definitions and expectations of high-, intermediate- and low-level disinfection. In many of these examples, the test micro-organisms demonstrate atypical tolerance or resistance profiles to disinfection processes. In addition to laboratory-based studies, there is now clinical evidence for at least some of these micro-organisms that biocide resistance can lead to infection outbreaks due to unexpected disinfection failure. These reports should encourage the reader to challenge current dogma, and reconsider the expectations of disinfection and sterilization practices.", "label": 1}

In this work the iodinated contrast media diatrizoate (DTZ) was used as model compound due to its relative resistance to oxidation. Identification of TPs was performed in ultrapure water (UPW) and RO brines applying nonthermal plasma (NTP) and UVA-TiO2 as oxidation techniques. The influence of main RO brines components in the formation and accumulation of TPs, such as chloride, bicarbonate alkalinity and humic acid, was also studied during UVA-TiO2. DTZ oxidation pattern in UPW resulted similar in both UVA-TiO2 and NTP achieving 66 and 61% transformation, respectively. However, DTZ transformation in RO brines was markedly lower in UVA-TiO2 (9%) than in NTP (27%). These differences can be attributed to the synergic effect of RO brines components during NTP. Moreover, reactive species other than hydroxyl radical contributed to DTZ transformation, i.e., direct photolysis in UVA-TiO2 and direct photolysis\u00a0+\u00a0O3 in NTP accounted for 16 and 23%, respectively. DTZ transformation led to iodide formation in both oxidation techniques but it further oxidized to iodate by ozone in NTP. In total 14 transformation products were identified in UPW of which 3 were present only in UVA-TiO2 and 2 were present exclusively in NTP; 5 of the 14 TPs were absent in RO brines. Five of them were new and were denoted as TP-474A/B, TP-522, TP-586, TP-602, TP-628. TP-522 (mono-chlorinated) was elucidated only in presence of high chloride titer-synthetic water matrix in NTP, most probably formed by active chlorine species generated in situ. TPs accumulation in RO brines was markedly different in comparison to UPW. This denotes the influence of RO brines components in the formation of reactive species that could further attack DTZ/TPs and/or scavenging performed by these brine components that could limit further TPs degradation. Five plausible degradation pathways are proposed for DTZ transformation in UPW.", "label": 0}

An increasing concentration of ClO(2) and CaO significantly reduced the microbialpopulation compared with the control. In addition, mild heating at 55 degrees C elicited greater microbial reduction than the other temperatures. A combined treatment of 50 ppm ClO(2) and 0.2% CaO at 55 degrees C reduced the population of naturally existing bacteria on kale by 3.10 logcolony forming units (CFU)/g, and the counts of E. coli O157:H7 were below the detection limit (1 log CFU/g). In addition, no significant differences in the Hunter color values were evident in any treatment during storage. Therefore, a combined treatment of ClO(2) and active CaO at 55 degrees C can be an effective sanitizing method to improve the microbiological safety of fresh-cut kale without affecting its quality.", "label": 0}

Hydrosols, or hydrolates, are secondary products of the hydrodistillation of plants; they consist of the distillation water in which very small amounts of essential oils remain dispersed. Historically used in traditional medicine in Mediterranean countries as refreshing drinks and flavorings, hydrosols have been recently noticed for their antimicrobial activity, both in\u00a0vitro and in food matrices, particularly against pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. Their antagonistic activity seems to be due to their chemical composition, being mainly constituted of phenolic compounds, which can interfere with microbial membranes, cell wall, or with the action of microbial enzymes. The use of hydrolates is already widespread in the cosmetic field, but the research carried out until now also suggests their application in the agro-food industry to hamper the development of pathogenic and spoiling microorganisms in food products and in working environments, and also in removing microbial biofilm. Moreover, their use could be exploited to counteract the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance. Hydrosols have been traditionally used also diluted in refreshing drinks, nevertheless toxycological implications should be better addressed.", "label": 0}

Many outbreaks have been attributed to C. difficile, some due to a new hyper-virulent strain that may cause more severe disease and a worse patient outcome.

Spores then survive for months in the environment; they cannot be destroyed by standard alcohol-based hand disinfection, and persist despite usual environmental cleaning agents. All these factors increase the risk of C. difficile transmission. Once CDAD is diagnosed in a patient, immediate implementation of appropriate infection control measures is mandatory in order to prevent further spread within the hospital. The quality and quantity of antibiotic prescribing should be reviewed to minimise the selective pressure for CDAD. This article provides a review of the literature that can be used for evidence-based guidelines to limit the spread of C. difficile. These include early diagnosis of CDAD, surveillance of CDAD cases, education of staff, appropriate use of isolation precautions, hand hygiene, protective clothing, environmental cleaning and cleaning of medical equipment, good antibiotic stewardship, and specific measures during outbreaks.

Replacing the five-member isocyclic ring in bacteriopyropheophorbide-a with a fused six-member N-butylimide ring system made no difference in regioselective oxidation, and the corresponding ring-B reduced chlorin was isolated in almost quantitative yield. When the oxidant was replaced by 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone, which is frequently used at the oxidizing stage of the porphyrin synthesis, the ring-B oxidized (ring-D reduced) chlorins were obtained. With both ring-B reduced and ring-D reduced chlorins in hand, their photophysical and electrochemical properties were examined and compared for the first time. The ring-B reduced chlorine 20, with a fused six-member N-butylimide ring, exhibits the most red-shifted absorption band (at lambda(max) = 746 nm), the lowest fluorescence quantum yield (4.5%), and the largest quantum yield of singlet oxygen formation (67%) among the reduced ring-B and ring-D chlorins investigated in this study. Measurements of the one-electron oxidation and reduction potentials show that compound 20 is also the easiest to oxidize among the examined compounds and the third easiest to reduce. In addition, the 1.62 eV HOMO-LUMO gap of 20 is the smallest of the examined compounds, and this agrees with values calculated using the DFT method. Spectroelectrochemical measurements afforded UV-visible absorption spectra for both the radical cations and radical anions of the examined chlorins. The ring-B reduced compound 20, with a fused six-member N-butylimide ring, is regarded as the most promising candidate in this study for photodynamic therapy because it has the longest wavelength absorption and the largest quantum yield of singlet oxygen formation among the compounds investigated.", "label": 0}

All babies were screened for MRSA on admission using ciprofloxacin-containing media which did not detect the outbreak strain. The first identified case was a premature baby who developed MRSA bacteraemia with associated tibial osteomyelitis and multiple subcutaneous abscesses. The outbreak strain was subsequently identified in the nasopharyngeal secretions of a second child who was not clinically infected. Screening of all patients on the NNU using non-ciprofloxacin-media identified two other colonised babies. All four patient isolates were EMRSA-15, spa type t022, SCCmec IV, Panton\u2013Valentine leucocidin (PVL) negative, indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and susceptible to all non-?-lactam antimicrobials tested. The outbreak strain was cultured from four of 48 environmental sites in a communal milk-expressing room. Unsupervised movement of mothers to and from the milk-expressing room may have contributed to the outbreak. Control measures included cohort isolation of affected babies, improved environmental cleaning, increased emphasis on hand hygiene and education of mothers. Ciprofloxacin-containing media should be used with caution for MRSA screening in settings where ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains (including community-associated MRSA) are increasing in prevalence.", "label": 0}
{"id": "5841", "title": "The effect of different processing parameters on the efficacy of commercial post-harvest washing of minimally processed spinach and shredded lettuce", "abstract": "The effect of different processing parameters on the efficacy of commercial post-harvest biocidal washes to decrease the bacterial loading on spinach and lettuce has been evaluated. Sampling was performed at two spinach processors (Facility A & B) and a shredded lettuce producer (Facility C). Aerobic colony counts (ACC) and coliform counts were determined on samples taken at pre- and post-wash. In parallel, the heterotrophic plate count (HPC) and coliform levels in wash water was also determined. Processing parameters measured were the temperature of leafy greens (pre- and post-washing) and wash water. The sanitizer levels (peroxyacetic acid, oxidation-reduction potential), pH, conductivity and turbidity were also measured. The wash process in Facility B had a residence time of 50 s for the spinach, maintained a constant hypochlorite concentration and continuously re-charged the tanks with fresh water. In contrast, Facility A had a short residence time (15 s) did not maintain a constant sanitizer (peroxyacetic, acid) concentration or re-charge tanks with fresh water. Despite the differences in processing operations there was no statistical difference between the log count reductions (LCR) obtained in ACC and coliform counts although counts were only reduced by <0.6 log cfu/g. The carriage of Escherichia coli on pre-wash spinach was 19% and 25% in Facility A and B respectively. There was a high prevalence (57% positive) of E. coli in the wash water of Facility A with none being recovered in water samples taken from Facility B. Yet, the carriage of E. coli on post-wash spinach was the same in the two facilities (7%). Lettuce harboured a lower level of both ACC and coliforms with LCR being significantly greater than spinach. In general, the LCR in ACC and coliforms could be positively correlated to bacterial counts of pre-washed leafy greens and conductivity (solids content) of the wash water. A negative correlation was found between LCR and water temperature. Interestingly, within the ranges measured the LCR was independent of the bacterial loading of the water. The results of the study confirmed the limited efficacy of biocidal washes to remove field acquired contamination. Although it is thought maintaining a low microbial loading in the wash water and maintaining sanitizer concentration is key the current study suggests high conductivity and low temperature of the wash water enhances the LCR achieved.

{"id": "2566", "title": "Differential efficacy of a chlorine dioxide-containing sanitizer against single species and binary biofilms of a dairy-associated Bacillus cereus and a Pseudomonas fluorescens isolate", "abstract": "AIMS: Daily exposure to 100 p.p.m. chlorine dioxide of single species and binary biofilms of dairy-associated Bacillus cereus DL5 and Pseudomonas fluorescens M2, attached to stainless steel surfaces in a laboratory flow system, was studied. METHODS AND RESULTS: Surfaces were sampled daily before and after sanitizer treatment and cells and spores dislodged and enumerated by standard methods. Duplicate surfaces were prepared for confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) and scanning electron microscopy. Higher counts of Ps. fluorescens M2 were obtained in single species biofilms, microcolonies stained green (viable) in CSLM images and were closely packed on attachment surfaces. By contrast, higher counts of B. cereus DL5 were obtained in binary biofilms, microcolonies stained green in CSLM images, but were more spread out. Lower spore counts were obtained for B. cereus DL5 in binary biofilms. The survival of Ps. fluorescens M2 cells after exposure to chlorine dioxide was apparently enhanced by the presence of B. cereus DL5 in binary biofilms. By contrast, B. cereus DL5 showed increased susceptibility to sanitizer treatment in the presence of Ps. fluorescens M2. CONCLUSIONS: Co-cultured bacteria in biofilms influence each other with respect to attachment capabilities and sanitizer resistance/susceptibility. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Binary biofilms endemic in food-processing industries can survive sanitation regimes and may represent reservoirs of product contamination leading to subsequent spoilage and/or food safety risks.", "label": 0}

We tested the effects of the metalloporphyrin catalytic antioxidant AEOL10150, a compound that scavenges peroxynitrite, inhibits lipid peroxidation, and has SOD and catalase-like activities, on Cl(2)-induced airway injury. Balb/C mice received 100ppm Cl(2) gas for 5 min. Four groups were studied: Cl(2) only, Cl(2) followed by AEOL10150 1 and 9 h after exposure, AEOL10150 only, and control. Twenty-four hours after Cl(2) gas exposure airway responsiveness to aerosolized methacholine (6.25-50mg/ml) was measured using a small-animal ventilator. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed to assess airway inflammation and protein. Whole lung tissue was assayed for 4-hydroxynonenal. In separate groups, lungs were collected at 72 h after Cl(2) injury to evaluate epithelial cell proliferation. Mice exposed to Cl(2) showed a significantly higher airway resistance compared to control, Cl(2)/AEOL10150, or AEOL10150-only treated animals in response to methacholine challenge. Eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages were elevated in BAL of Cl(2)-exposed mice. AEOL10150 attenuated the increases in neutrophils and macrophages. AEOL10150 prevented Cl(2)-induced increase in BAL fluid protein. Chlorine induced an increase in the number of proliferating airway epithelial cells, an effect AEOL10150 attenuated. 4-Hydroxynonenal levels in the lung were increased after Cl(2) and this effect was prevented with AEOL10150. AEOL10150 is an effective rescue treatment for Cl(2)-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, injury-induced airway epithelial cell regeneration, and oxidative stress.", "label": 0}
{"id": "9438", "title": "Waterborne outbreak control: which disinfectant?", "abstract": "Drinking water disinfection was shown to be an important public health measure around the turn of the century. In the United States, it was perhaps the single most important factor in controlling typhoid fever, a waterborne disease that was rampant throughout the world during the last century. It may also be assumed that disinfection was important in limiting the number of cases of other diseases known to be capable of waterborne transmission, i.e., cholera, amebiasis, shigellosis, salmonellosis, and hepatitis A. Even though modern treatment has eliminated water as a major vehicle of infectious disease transmission, outbreaks still occur. In fact, the annual number has been increasing since 1966. Interruption in chlorination or failure to achieve adequate levels of chlorine residual is the most often identified deficiency of the involved water supplies. This finding indicates that waterborne microbial pathogens remain as a potential health threat and underscores the importance of disinfection. From the outset, chlorination has been the drinking water disinfectant of choice in the country. Numerous studies have demonstrated its ability to inactivate bacterial, viral, and protozoal pathogens when applied under proper conditions. However, the finding that chlorinated organics that are potentially carcinogenic are formed has prompted an evaluation of alternative disinfectants. The viable alternatives to chlorine currently under consideration for widespread use are ozone, chlorine dioxide, and chloramines. In terms of biocidal efficiency, ozone is the most potent of the three. Chlorine dioxide is about the equivalent of free chlorine in the hypochlorous acid form but much more efficient than the hypochlorite form of free chlorine. The chloramines are weaker biocides than hypochlorite. Although this general order of ranking of efficiency holds for diverse types of microorganisms, quantitative comparisons vary with different microorganisms and experimental conditions.", "label": 1}

Clorobiocin was the most active compound both against E. coli DNA gyrase in vitro and against bacterial growth. All tested modifications of the 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoyl moiety reduced biological activity. The highest activities were shown by compounds containing a hydrophobic alkyl substituent at position 3 of the 4-hydroxybenzoyl moiety. Polar groups in this side chain, especially amide functions, strongly reduced antibacterial activity. Replacement of the alkyl side chain with a halogen atom or a methoxy group at the same position markedly reduced activity. Transfer of the pyrrole carboxylic acid moiety from O-3\" to O-2\" of L-noviose moderately reduced activity, whereas the complete absence of the pyrrole carboxylic acid moiety led to a loss of activity. Desclorobiocin derivatives lacking the chlorine atom at C-8 of the 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxycoumarin moiety also showed low activity. Lack of a methyl group at O-4\" of L-noviose resulted in an inactive compound. From these findings it appears that clorobiocin represents a \"highly evolved\" structure optimized for bacterial transport and DNA gyrase inhibition.", "label": 0}

The use of hazardous materials of chemical or biological origin as weapons and for homicide has been documented since ancient times. The first use of chemicals in terms of weapons of mass destruction goes back to World War I, when on April 22, 1915 large amounts of chlorine were released by German military forces at Ypres, Belgium. Until around the 1970s of the 20th century, the awareness of the threat by chemical and biological agents had been mainly confined to the military sector. In the following time, the development of increasing range delivery systems by chemical and biological agents possessors sensitised public attention to the threat emanating from these agents. Their proliferation to the terrorists field during the 1990s with the expanding scale and globalisation of terrorist attacks suggested that these agents are becoming an increasing threat to the whole world community.

{"id": "2942", "title": "Mechanism of anionic conduction across ClC", "abstract": "ClC chloride channels are voltage-gated transmembrane proteins that have been associated with a wide range of regulatory roles in vertebrates. To accomplish their function, they allow small inorganic anions to efficiently pass through, while blocking the passage of all other particles. Understanding the conduction mechanism of ClC has been the subject of many experimental investigations, but until now, the detailed dynamic mechanism was not known despite the availability of crystallographic structures. We investigate Cl(-) conduction by means of an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the ClC channel in a membrane environment. Based on our simulation results, we propose a king-of-the-hill mechanism for permeation, in which a lone ion bound to the center of the ClC pore is pushed out by a second ion that enters the pore and takes its place. Although the energy required to extract the single central ion from the pore is enormous, by resorting to this two-ion process, the largest free energy barrier for conduction is reduced to 4 kcal/mol. At the narrowest part of the pore, residues Tyr-445 and Ser-107 stabilize the central ion. There, the bound ion blocks the pore, disrupting the formation of a continuous water file that could leak protons, possibly preventing the passage of uncharged solutes.", "label": 0}

A number of clones were obtained by infection of carrot tissues with Agrobacterium rhizogenes and two (the fastest and the slowest growing root clones) were chosen for further experimentation. Both clones showed a similar degree of tolerance towards phenol and its chlorinated derivatives, i.e. the growth of root biomass was maintained in concentrations of phenol equivalent to 1000 micromol/l, whilst the chlorophenols were tolerated only at concentrations 20 times lower (50 micromol/l).

The results indicate that the inhibition efficiency of Ce-MCM-48 for BrO3- formation could reach 82-90% as the initial Br- concentration varied from 200-800 mu g/L under typical water treatment conditions: aqueous ozone concentration = 2.0 +/- 0.1 mg/L, HRT = 10 min, initial pH = 7.7-7.9, and T = 18 +/- 2 degrees C. The extension of HRT from 10 to 20 min and pH variation in the range of 6.0-9.0 had insignificant impact on the inhibition efficiency of BrO3- formation. Compared with ozonation alone, the catalytic ozonation could achieve almost the same efficiencies for TOC removal and Escherichia coli inactivation. A long-term continuous operation experiment for 33 days demonstrated that the granular catalyst Ce-MCM-48 possesses not only a high efficiency, but also a large treatment capacity for minimizing BrO3- formation during the ozonation process, and thus has potential applications to water treatment.

The second objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of disinfectants at recommended concentrations and contact times for removing L. monocytogenes biofilm cells from a stainless steel surface covered with catfish mucus extract. Growth and biofilm formation of all L. monocytogenes strains increased with higher concentrations of catfish mucus extract at both 10 and 22 degrees C. When 15 mug/mL catfish mucus extract was added to 3 log CFU/mL L. monocytogenes, the biofilm levels of L. monocytogenes on stainless steel reached 4 to 5 log CFU per coupon at 10 degrees C and 5 to 6 log CFU per coupon at 22 degrees C in 7 days. With 375 mug/mL catfish mucus extract, the biofilm levels of L. monocytogenes on stainless steel reached 5 to 6 log CFU per coupon at 10 degrees C and 6 to 7.5 log CFU per coupon at 22 degrees C in 7 days. No differences ( P > 0.05) were observed between L. monocytogenes strains tested for biofilm formation in catfish mucus extract on the stainless steel surface. The biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes catfish isolate HCC23 was lower on Buna-N rubber than on stainless steel, polyethylene, and polyurethane surfaces in the presence of catfish mucus extract ( P < 0.05). Contact angle analysis and atomic force microscopy confirmed that Buna-N rubber was highly hydrophobic, with lower surface energy and less roughness than the other three surfaces. The complete reduction of L. monocytogenes biofilm cells was achieved on the stainless steel coupons with a mixture of disinfectants, such as quaternary ammonium compounds with hydrogen peroxide or peracetic acid with hydrogen peroxide and octanoic acid at 25 or 50% of the recommended concentration, in 1 or 3 min compared with use of the quaternary ammonium compounds, chlorine, or acid disinfectants alone, which were ineffective for removing all the L. monocytogenes biofilm cells.", "label": 1}

Edible coatings were prepared from chitosan (CH) and its water-soluble derivative carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCH), separately. Pear wedges were immersed in SC solution, followed by coating with CH or CMCH solutions. The samples were packed in unsealed bags and stored at 4 \u00b0C for subsequent color, firmness, and weight loss measurement. The effects of the SC and coating treatments on polyphenol oxidase (PPO) inhibition and microbial inactivation were also evaluated. Results indicated that SC exhibited significant (P &lt; 0.05) inhibition of browning and PPO activity. The SC treatment was also strongly effective in inactivating Escherichia coli O157:H7 on pear slices. Coating SC-treated pear slices with CH adversely affected the quality of pear slices by accelerating the discoloration of cut surfaces and increasing the PPO activity. On the contrary, coating SC-treated samples with CMCH significantly prevented the browning reaction and inhibited PPO activity. In addition, SC and CH/CMCH coatings maintained tissue firmness and did not affect weight loss. Our study may provide a scientific basis for the use of SC + CMCH treatment as an alternative preservation treatment for fresh-cut fruits and vegetables.", "label": 0}

Additionally, compounds L6, L7, C3, C5 and C7 were analyzed using X-ray diffraction. An evaluation of cytotoxicity and cell death in vitro for both ligands and complexes was performed by colorimetric assay and flow cytometry, in four cancer cell lines and VERO cells as the control, respectively. Cytotoxicity and selectivity demonstrated by each compound were dependent on the cancer cell line assayed. IC50 values of complexes C1\u20135 and C7 were lower than those exhibited for the reference drug cisplatin, and selectivity of these complexes was in general terms greater than cisplatin on three cancer cell lines studied. In HL60 cells, complexes C1 and C5 exhibited the lowest values of IC50 and were almost five times more selective than cisplatin. Flow cytometry results suggest that each complex predominantly induced necrosis, and its variant necroptosis, instead of apoptosis in all cancer cell lines studied. DNA binding assays, using agarose gel electrophoresis and UV\u2013visible spectrophotometry studies, displayed a strong interaction only between C4 and DNA. In fact, theoretical calculations showed that C4-DNA binding complex was the most thermodynamic favorable interaction among the complexes in study. Overall, induction of cell death by dependent and independent-DNA-metal compound interactions were possible using imidoyl-indazole Pt(II) complexes as anticancer agents.", "label": 0}

Here, individual DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (KF) molecules were tethered to a single-walled carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (SWCNT-FET) to investigate accommodation of dNTP analogs with single-molecule resolution. Each base incorporation accompanied a change in current with its duration defined by ?<inf>closed</inf>. Under V<inf>max</inf> conditions, the average time of ?<inf>closed</inf> was similar for all analog and native dNTPs (0.2 to 0.4 ms), indicating no kinetic impact on this step due to analog structure. Accordingly, the average rates of dNTP analog incorporation were largely determined by durations with no change in current defined by ?<inf>open</inf>, which includes molecular recognition of the incoming dNTP. All ?-thio-dNTPs were incorporated more slowly, at 40 to 65% of the rate for the corresponding native dNTPs. During polymerization with 6-Cl-2APTP, 2-thio-dTTP, or 2-thio-dCTP, the nanocircuit uncovered an alternative conformation represented by positive current excursions that does not occur with native dNTPs. A model consistent with these results invokes rotations by the enzyme's O-helix; this motion can test the stability of nascent base pairs using nonhydrophilic interactions and is allosterically coupled to charged residues near the site of SWCNT attachment. This model with two opposing O-helix motions differs from the previous report in which all current excursions were solely attributed to global enzyme closure and covalent-bond formation. The results suggest the enzyme applies a dynamic stability-checking mechanism for each nascent base pair.", "label": 0}

The patient-specific FEA with a nonuniform ferrule and nonlinear contact biting load associated with clinical validation can be used to predict failure. Methods A patient was selected with both maxillary central incisors with different ferrule designs who received endodontic treatment and restoration using a fiber post, composite core, and computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing lithium disilicate ceramic crowns. Strain gauges were attached to the buccal surfaces of both teeth to record ceramic strain during bite force recording for FEA validation. Cone-beam computed tomographic imaging was performed, and the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine files were exported to Mimics, 3-Matic (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium) and Patran (MSC Software, Santa Ana, CA) software to create a patient-specific FEA model. Bite load was applied using contact load applied by antagonist teeth (155 N). Mechanical properties were obtained from the literature. Modified von Mises equivalent stress was used for stress evaluation. Results Stresses on the dentin and fiber post on the left incisor, which had a nonuniform ferrule, were higher compared with the right incisor. The strain values recorded for the right central incisor (strain gauge =79.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8 ?S and FEA = 69.5 ?S) and the left central incisor (strain gauge = 83.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3 ?S and FEA = 73.9 ?S) validate the FEA analysis. Conclusions FEA was validated with in\u00a0vivo strain values measured at the buccal crown surfaces, supporting that the stress levels were realistic for investigation of the clinical performance of fiber posts. Maintaining a uniform ferrule was more favorable than a localized higher ferrule.", "label": 0}

The nasal potential difference (NPD) test has been proposed to provide evidence of abnormal function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a receptor that forms a chloride ion channel. The test is especially useful for patients who have normal chloride concentrations in sweat tests and in whom 2 gene mutations related to cystic fibrosis have not been detected. The NPD test requires 2 electrodes connected to a voltmeter (a Tholy-Medicap\u00ae device). One is placed on the nasal mucosa of the inferior turbinate and the other is placed subcutaneously on the forearm. A reading less than \u201440 mV is considered abnormal, as values under that cut point are never found in healthy individuals. Two abnormal NPD findings on separate days are required for a diagnosis of CFTR dysfunction. False negatives arise when the integrity of the epithelium is altered. After application of amiloride, NPD decreases more markedly in cystic fibrosis patients than in healthy individuals and applying isoproterenol or fenoterol after amiloride provokes no response in patients with the genetic defect that prevents chloride ion channel activation.", "label": 0}

However, only limited data are available on the susceptibility of B anthracis to antiseptics. The aim was to evaluate the efficacy of several hand antiseptics (interventions) and soap and water (control) against Bacillus atrophaeus, a surrogate of B anthracis. Challenge study conducted among healthy adult volunteers, using the Std. Test Method for Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Health Care Professional Handwash Formulations (American Society for Testing and Materials E 1174-94) to det. the efficacy of various hand hygiene products at wash times of 10, 30, and 60 s. Volunteers were excluded if they had eczema, psoriasis, or other chronic skin conditions; nonintact skin; or allergies to any study agent. Study agents were a waterless rub contg. 61% Et alc., a 2% chlorhexidine gluconate prepn., and an antibacterial microfiber towel that releases hypochlorite. A nonantimicrobial soap was used as a control. Redn. of B atrophaeus spores (log,, CFU/mL) on contaminated hands. Results: Washes of 10,30, and 60 s with either soap and water or 2% chlorhexidine gluconate eliminated 1.5 to 2.0 log10 CFUs/mL of B atrophaeus spores at wash 3. Mean redns.

A new chlorine dioxide generation process in which dilute, humidified chlorine gas is in contact with solid sodium chlorite was employed for this study. Chlorine dioxide was found to be effective in achieving CT values (pH=8 and temperature=20 degreesC) of approximately 50 and 100 mg (.) min/l for 1-log and 2-log Cryptosporidium inactivation, respectively. Chlorine dioxide did not form significant amounts of trihalomethanes or haloacetic acids.

{"id": "5723", "title": "Effects of post-processing handling and packaging on microbial populations", "abstract": "The type of produce, process conditions, and prior temperature management will all affect the mix of microorganisms found on fresh produce. Normally, fresh produce will be covered by a complex mix of bacteria, fungi and yeasts that are characteristic of that fruit or vegetable. For example, carrots typically have large numbers of Lactobacillus and other lactic acid bacteria while apples may have relatively large numbers of yeasts. Which of these microorganisms will come to dominate the population will be a function of the make-up of the original population on the product in the field, distribution time, distribution temperature and the atmosphere within the package. Another chief determinant of microbial populations will be the physiological condition of the product. Factors that injure or weaken the plant tissues map be expected to encourage microbial growth while conditions that maintain the physiological integrity of the tissues may be expected to discourage microbial growth. Each of these factors can be expected to affect the make-up of the microbial population in characteristic ways but always constrained by the initial condition of original population makeup. This paper describes which microorganisms are favored by given conditions in order to develop a concert of microbial management designed to favor desirable microbes at the expense of undesirable ones. Particular emphasis will be placed on the effects of modified atmospheres on microorganisms, especially human pathogens. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.", "label": 1}

The intent was to define the rank of each in the treatment cycle of reusable medical devices and to validate \"in use\" parameters. Microplates were contaminated by yeast extract, bovine albumin supplemented with sheep blood, fibrin and bovine serum, and exposed to products (6 detergents, 2 chemical inactivators of prions and 3 disinfectants) at different concentrations and for different times. The overall efficacy of treatments was compared to untreated control microplates. The products which are recognised as chemical prion inactivator are able to eliminate all types of soils. In particular, sodium hypochlorite was found to be interesting, including at concentrations lower than 2 % (v/v), recommended by W.H.O.

The molar conductivity values of the metal complexes revealed their ionic nature. The thermal stability of metal complexes was demonstrated by TGA/DTA studies while the crystalline nature of the complexes has been ascertained by XRD. Furthermore, a comparative account of in vitro antibacterial study against different bacterial strains with respect to standard antibiotic and scavenging activity against standard control at different concenterations unfolded pronounced antibacterial and radical scavenging potencies of the metal complexes as compared to free ligands. In addition, in vitro cytotoxicity of ligands and its metal complexes was also screened on MCF7 (Human breast adenocarcinoma), HeLa (Human cervical carcinoma) and HepG2 (Human Hepatocellular carcinoma), cell lines and normal cells (PBMC). The antiproliferative outcomes revealed that metal complexes exhibit superior activity in general as compared to free ligands (L1 and L2) where metal complexes (1 and 2) of 5-chloro isatin linked benzothiazole motif (L1) are found to have better prospect of acting as chemotherapeutic agents which can be explained in terms of greater biopotency, planarity and conjugation against all the tested cancer cell lines with IC50 &lt; 2.80 ?M.", "label": 0}

However, apples washed in the EW for 5 min had less hue angle value throughout storage period and lower sensory evaluation score at the end of storage. Strong acidic (2 min dipping) and weak acidic (either 2 or 5 min dipping) EW was as effective as chlorine in reducing microbial growth of apples. No significant differences in color, sol. solid content, pH, and sensorial quality occurred among tap water, chlorine, and weak acidic EW.

Phototherapy can be administered in the hospital, outpatient clinic, or in the patient's home. The purpose of this review is to provide some practical guidance to general dermatologists and residents on the specifics of using phototherapy, which, despite its decreasing use, remains one of our most safe and effective treatment strategies for psoriasis care. We conducted a literature review of home phototherapy, BB-UVB, NB-UVB, and PUVA phototherapy using PubMed, MD Consult, and reference lists. A variety of protocols for BB-UVB, NB-UVB, and PUVA have been used in clinical trials. NB-UVB is more effective than BB-UVB and safer than PUVA. Typical regimens for NB-UVB involve dosing 3 times per week for at least 3 months. Treatment must be independently developed to suit each participant's needs. Ultraviolet light is an effective, relatively safe modality that is a valuable tool in the treatment of psoriasis. NB-UVB phototherapy is considered the first-line treatment for extensive plaque type psoriasis.", "label": 0}

Biofilms of 4 selected strains were also produced either on pure cultures or on co-cultures with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1), at 12 degrees C and at 37 degrees C. For these biofilms, the minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs) of 4 commercial dairy sanitizers (1 alkyl amine acetate based--T99, 2 chlorine based--T66 and DD, and 1 phosphoric acid based--BP) were determined. Listeria monocytogenes biofilms grown, either at 37 degrees C or 12 degrees C, were able to achieve similar cell densities by using different incubation periods (24 h and 7 d, respectively). In co-culture biofilms, P. aeruginosa was the dominant species, either at 37 degrees C or at 12 degrees C, representing 99% of a total biofilm population of 6 to 7 log CFU/peg. Co-culture biofilms were generally less susceptible than L. monocytogenes pure cultures. More interestingly, the biofilms produced at 12 degrees C were usually less susceptible to the sanitizers than when produced at 37 degrees C. Single or co-culture biofilms of L. monocytogenes and PAO1, particularly produced at 12 degrees C, retrieved MBEC values for agents T99 and BP that were, at times, above the maximum in-use recommended concentrations for these agents. The results presented here reinforce the importance of the temperature used for biofilm formation, when susceptibility to sanitizers is being assessed. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Since most food plants have cold wet growth niches in production and storage areas, susceptibility testing should be performed on biofilms produced at refrigeration temperatures. Moreover, the efficiency of the sanitizers used in food industries should be performed on mixed culture biofilms, since in field conditions these will predominate. The results presented here highlight the importance of the temperature used for biofilm formation, when susceptibility to disinfectants is being assessed, as biofilms produced at lower temperature were less susceptible to sanitizers.", "label": 1}

The seasonal variations in the E. coli densities among the plankton size categories were significant (p <0.05). Correlation anal. suggested that the counts of E. coli correlated neg. with salinity (P < 0.001) and pos. with temp., pH, turbidity and dissolved O (p <0.001) in the final effluent.

After exposure to chlorine viable bacteria were undetectable by conventional plate count techniques; however, persistence of B. pseudomallei was verified by flow cytometry and bacteria were recoverable following a simple one-step broth procedure. The minimum residual chlorine concentration and contact time as prescribed by potable water providers in Australia was insufficient to reduce a B. pseudomallei population by more than 2log(10). Chlorine had a bacteriostatic effect only on B. pseudomallei; viable bacteria were recovered from water containing up to 1000 ppm free chlorine. This finding has practical implications for water treatment in regions where B. pseudomallei is endemic.

The biofilm-forming microorganisms have been shown to elicit specific mechanisms for initial attachment to a surface, formation of microcolony leading to development of three-dimensional structure of mature biofilm. They differ from their free-living counterparts in their growth rate, composition and increased resistance to biocides, antibiotics and antibodies by virtue of up regulation and/or down regulation of approximately 40 per cent of their genes.

The cornerstone of airway defense is mucus contg. diverse antimicrobial factors that kill or inactivate pathogens. Most of the mucus in the upper airways is secreted by airway submucosal glands. In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), airway defense fails and the lungs are colonized by bacteria, usually Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Accumulating evidence suggests that airway submucosal glands contribute to CF pathogenesis by failing to respond appropriately to inhalation of bacteria. However, the regulation of submucosal glands by the innate immune system remains poorly understood. We studied the response of submucosal glands to the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1? and tumor necrosis factor-?. These are released into the airway submucosa in response to infection with the bacterium P. aeruginosa and are elevated in CF airways. Stimulation with IL-1? and TNF-? increased submucosal gland secretion in a concn.-dependent manner with a maximal secretion rate of 240 \u00b1 20 and 190 \u00b1 40 pl/min, resp. The half maximal effective concns. were 11 and 20 ng/mL, resp. The cytokine effect was dependent on cAMP but was independent of cGMP, nitric oxide, Ca2+, or p38 MAP kinase. Most importantly, IL-1?- and TNF-?-stimulated secretion was blocked by the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) blocker, CFTRinh172 (100 ?mol/l) but was not affected by the Ca2+-activated Cl- channel blocker, niflumic acid (1 ?mol/l). The data suggest, that during bacterial infections and resulting release of proinflammatory cytokines, the glands are stimulated to secrete fluid, and this response is mediated by cAMP-activated CFTR, a process that would fail in patients with CF.

Thorough, manual cleaning followed by immersion in 2% glutaraldehyde or the use of automatic washer/disinfectors is widely practiced in many hospitals. Exposure to glutaraldehyde fumes is known to cause asthma and dermatitis in health care staff. The Advisory Committee on Toxic Substances of the Health and Safety Commission, UK, has stipulated a Maximum Exposure Limit (MEL) of 0.02 ppm as a weighted average over a period of 8 hours for glutaraldehyde. Endoscopy units are therefore required to install expensive ventilation and air extraction systems to protect their staff. Furthermore, contact times of 10 minutes for routine disinfection and 20 minutes for high level disinfection have been recommended for 2% glutaraldehyde by the British Thoracic Society and the British Society for Gastroenterology. Longer exposure times of 60-95 minutes have been proposed for elimination of Mycobacterium avium intracellulare. Alternative disinfectants such as peracetic acid and chlorine dioxide have been successfully evaluated. Peracetic acid is expensive and tarnishes metal components of the endoscope and erodes components of the washer/disinfector apparatus, necessitating modification of the machine. It is also less stable than glutaraldehyde requiring change of solution every 24 hours. Chlorine dioxide based disinfectants have similar disadvantages. These constraints have strained the resources of endoscopy units that need rapid turn around of endoscope cleaning and disinfection for use between patients. This paper describes the microbicidal and in-use activity of Sterilox, against a range of organisms. Peracetic acid and 2% glutaraldehyde were included as comparison. Sterilox achieved >5log10 kill with 5% horse serum (HS) in 2 minutes against Ps. aeruginosa, vancomycin resistant Enterococcus species, E. coli, S. aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and four atypical Mycobacterium species: M. avium, chelonei, xenopi and smegmatis. Sporicidal activity (Clostridium difficile, Bacillus subtilis var. niger) was diminished in the presence of 5% HS. Increasing the volume of Sterilox, achieved >5log10 kill in the presence of 1% HS. Sterilox, was virucidal in 2 minutes against HIV, poliomyelitis virus type 2 and duck embryo hepatitis B virus in the presence of 1% HS. There was rapid loss of viability of Cryptosporidium parvum (90% in 30 minutes) by dye exclusion. In-use tests with automated endoscope washer/disinfector apparatus showed microbicidal activity within 2 minutes, when endocscopes were thoroughly pre-cleaned.

All three waste samples were found to be active by inducing of unscheduled DNA-synthesis in mouse hepatocytes in vitro. In the bacterial rec-type repair test with Proteus mirabilis, waste samples taken from the turbo pump and the vacuum pipe system were not genotoxic. The waste sample taken from the chlorine-mediated plasma reactor was clearly positive in the bacterial repair assay and in the SOS chromotest wit Escherichia coli. Mutagenic activity was demonstrated for all samples in the presence and absence of S9 mix made from mouse liver homogenate. Again, highest mutagenic activity was recorded for the waste sample taken from the plasma reactor, while samples collected from the turbo pump and from the waste air system before dilution and liberation of the air were less mutagenic. For all samples chromosomal damage in V79 cells was not detected, indicating absence of clastogenic activity in vitro. Altogether, these results indicate generation of genotoxic and mutagenic products as a consequence of chlorine-mediated plasma etching in the microelectronics industry and the presence of genotoxins even in places distant from the plasma reactor.

Treatment of these compounds by conventional oxidants produces disinfection by-products (DBP). Ferrate(VI) (Fe(VI)O(4)(2-), Fe(VI)) is a strong oxidizing agent and produces a non-toxic by-product Fe(III), which acts as a coagulant. Ferrate(VI) is also an efficient disinfectant and can inactivate chlorine resistant microorganisms. A novel ferrate(VI) technology can thus treat a wide range of pollutants and microorganisms in water and wastewater. The aim of this paper is to review the kinetics and products of the oxidation of nitrogen-containing inorganic (ammonia, hydroxylamine, hydrazine, and azide) and organic (amines, amino acids, anilines, sulfonamides, macrolides, and dyes) compounds by ferrate(VI) in order to demonstrate the feasibility of ferrate(VI) treatment of polluted waters of various origins. Several of the compounds can degraded in seconds to minutes by ferrate(VI) with the formation of non-hazardous products.

Such reversibility makes epigenetic modifications ideal targets for therapeutic intervention. The epigenome of cancer cells is extensively modified by specific hypermethylation of the promoters of tumor suppressor genes relative to the extensive hypomethylation of repetitive sequences, overall loss of acetylation, and loss of repressive marks at microsatellite/repeat regions. In this review, we discuss emerging therapies targeting specific epigenetic modifications or epigenetic modifying enzymes either alone or in combination with other treatment regimens. The limitations posed by cancer treatments elicit unintended epigenetic modifications that result in exacerbation of tumor progression are also discussed.

This study sought to determine whether irritant-induced nasal congestion involves mast cell degranulation. Eight SAR and eight NR subjects were exposed to both 1.0 parts per million chlorine and filtered air in separate visits; exposures were via nasal mask and lasted 15 min. Rhinomanometry was performed before, immediately after and 15 min after exposure. Following ?2 weeks, exposures and symptom reporting were repeated with nasal lavage, rather than rhinomanometry, pre- and postexposure. A separate substudy using rye grass antigen provided a positive control. Mast cell tryptase was measured in nasal lavage fluid from both substudies using an automated fluoroenzyme immunoassay. Chlorine provocation significantly increased nasal airway resistance in SAR but not NR subjects. Conversely, tryptase levels in nasal lavage fluid were unaffected. Nasal allergen challenge significantly increased both nasal obstruction and nasal lavage tryptase in SAR subjects. Irritant-induced nasal congestion is more pronounced among seasonal allergic rhinitic than nonrhinitic subjects.

All UVM samples were enriched for 48\u00a0h and then streaked to MOX if Listeria was not quantifiable by direct plating. After slicing one onion inoculated at 8.6\u00a0log\u00a0CFU/onion followed by 20 uninoculated onions, onions 1, 10 and 20 yielded average Listeria populations of 6.7, 3.8, and 2.7 log compared to 3.2, 1.6, and 1.7\u00a0log\u00a0CFU/onion and 3.6, 1.3, and 0.9\u00a0log\u00a0CFU/onion when the initial onion contained 6.8 and 5.9\u00a0CFU/onion, respectively. Listeria transfer during onion slicing was best described using an exponential decay model which should help to further the understanding of Listeria transfer during onion processing and provide the industry with guidelines to improve end product safety.", "label": 0}

However, increased TCF pulp production is accompanied by an increase in chelate use. The most commonly used chelates, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DPTA), are considered to be relatively persistent substances in water treatment plants, and consequently environmentally critical compounds. The purpose of this work is to investigate DPTA behaviour in an anaerobic system. An Anaerobic Filter (AF) was operated with three different DPTA load rates (LRDPTA = 0.07 - 0.28 gDPTA/Lxd), and the operating strategy was to maintain the anaerobic system stable during the entire operation (alkalinity ratio below 0.3). The AF's maximum Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal was 59%, whereas the Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD5) was around 95%. However, only 5% of DPTA removal was observed under anaerobic conditions during the first operating period.

The GFP-chromophore damage caused by singlet oxygen was studied in COS 7 kidney cells and E. coli bacteria following light irradiation. Electron spin resonance (ESR) revealed the generation of endogenous singlet oxygen (1O2) by photoactivated GFP, an effect similar to that produced by the exogenous photosensitizer chlorin e6. A light dose-dependent photobleaching effect of GFP was pronounced at low pH or upon photosensitization with chlorin e6. However, the 1O2 quenchers ?-carotene and sodium azide minimized GFP photobleaching. Gel electrophoresis of photosensitized GFP followed by fluorescence multi-pixel spectral imaging revealed the binding of chlorin e6 to GFP, affecting the photobleaching efficacy. Fluorescence multi-pixel spectral imaging of GFP-transfected COS7 cells demonstrated the presence of GFP in the cytoplasm and nucleus, while chlorin e6 was found to be concentrated in the perinuclear vesicles. Exposure of the cells to light induced GFP photobleaching in the close vicinity of chlorin e6 vesicles. We conclude that photoactivated GFP generates endogenous 1O2, inducing chromophore damage, which can be enhanced by the cooperation of exogenous chlorine e6.", "label": 0}

In this study, we designed m-aminophenyl groups as novel N-1 substituents of naphthyridones and quinolones. Among newly synthesized compounds, 7-(3-aminoazetidin-1-yl)-1-(5-amino-2,4-difluorophenyl)-8-chloro-6- fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (4) has extremely potent antibacterial activities against Gram (+) as well as Gram (-) bacteria. This compound is significantly more potent than trovafloxacin against clinical isolates: 30 times against Streptococcus pneumoniae and 128 times against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) study revealed that a limited combination of 1-(5-amino-2,4-difluorophenyl) group, 7-(azetidin-1-yl) group, and 8-Cl atom (or Br atom or Me group) gave potent antibacterial activity. An X-ray crystallographic study of a 7-(3-ethylaminoazetidin-1-yl)-8-chloro derivative demonstrated that the N-1 aromatic group was remarkably distorted out of the core quinolone plane by steric repulsion between the C-8 Cl atom and the N-1 substituent. Furthermore, a molecular modeling study of 4 and its analogues demonstrated that a highly distorted orientation was induced by a steric hindrance of the C-8 substituent, such as Cl, Br, or a methyl group. Thus, their highly strained conformation should be a key factor for the potent antibacterial activity.", "label": 0}

As a follow-up to our previous work, the combined impact of ClO2 gassing and freezing rate on the microbiological quality of frozen blueberries was examined. Sixteen lugs of blueberries (similar to 9.1 kg/lug) were stacked inside a large plastic container at a commercial blueberry processing facility. In each of four trials, one container was exposed to ClO2 gas (4 ppm) using three 3-kg sachets while one ungassed container remained untarped. Before and after commercial processing, 50-g samples of gassed and ungassed blueberries were quantitatively examined for mesophilic aerobic bacteria (MAB), yeasts, and molds. After processing, additional 50-g samples were placed in a -20 degrees C freezer under different conditions where the berries reached a temperature of -3 degrees C after 3 h (quick-frozen), 2 days (intermediate-frozen) and 5 days (slow-frozen). Fruit was sampled periodically during 6 months of frozen storage at -20 degrees C. MAB yeast and mold populations decreased similar to 2 and 1 log CFU/g, respectively, in ClO2-gassed and ungassed fruit, with MAB, yeast and mold populations increasing similar to 1 log CFU/g during quick freezing to -3 degrees C and similar to 2 log CFU/g during intermediate and slow freezing to similar to 3 degrees C. Based on these findings, ClO2 gassing followed by quick freezing provides an effective means for meeting the current microbiological standards being imposed by buyers of frozen blueberries.

The contribution of the carbonyl group to activity inducing aberrations of treated waters was found to be large. On the other hand, the contribution of the nitro group was small. In the case of chlorinated water, organochlorine compounds contribute to activity inducing aberrations in addition to carbonyl group. The carbonyl group could be useful as a coarse indicator to compare activity inducing aberrations among waters treated with chlorine dioxide, chloramine, and ozone.

A minidrum sprouter equipped with automatic irrigation and rotation systems was built to allow sprouting to be conducted under conditions similar to those used commercially. The growth of Salmonella during sprouting in the minidrum was compared with that observed in sprouts grown in glass jars under conditions commonly used at home. The level of Salmonella increased by as much as 4 log units after 48 h of sprouting in jars but remained constant during the entire sprouting period in the minidrum. The effect of temperature and irrigation frequency on Salmonella growth was examined. Increasing the sprouting temperature from 20 to 30 degrees C increased the Salmonella counts by as much as 2 log units on sprouts grown both in the minidrum and in the glass jars. Decreasing the irrigation frequency from every 20 min to every 2 h during sprouting in the minidrum or from every 4 h to every 24 h during sprouting in the glass jars resulted in an approximately 2-log increase in Salmonella counts. The levels of total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, coliforms, and Salmonella in spent irrigation water closely reflected those found in sprouts, confirming that monitoring of spent irrigation water is a good way to monitor pathogen levels during sprouting.", "label": 0}

Spatio-temporal analysis of GOs was performed during six winter seasons, and clinical and viral data were analysed with regard to structural parameters (size of the sites and dining-room organization), virus epidemiology and chronology of the outbreaks and type of activities. Results A total of 98 outbreaks were recorded in the 35 units. The risk of GO was high even outside national epidemic periods. Viruses were searched for in 86 outbreaks and were identified in 96.5% (83/86) of these outbreaks: norovirus genotype GII.4 (59.0%, 49/83), other viruses (41.0%, 34/83). There were variations between surveillance periods in terms of GO frequencies and attack rates and types of viruses. Dining-room organization could be a factor in cross-infection at a site.

A preference for sweet taste is innate and sweeteners can increase the pleasure of eating. Nutritive sweeteners contain carbohydrate and provide energy. They occur naturally in foods or may be added in food processing or by consumers before consumption. Higher intake of added sugars is associated with higher energy intake and lower diet quality, which can increase the risk for obesity, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. On average, adults in the United States consume 14.6% of energy from added sugars. Polyols (also referred to as sugar alcohols) add sweetness with less energy and may reduce risk for dental caries. Foods containing polyols and/or no added sugars can, within food labeling guidelines, be labeled as sugar-free. NNS are those that sweeten with minimal or no carbohydrate or energy. They are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration as food additives or generally recognized as safe. The Food and Drug Administration approval process includes determination of probable intake, cumulative effect from all uses, and toxicology studies in animals. Seven NNS are approved for use in the United States: acesulfame K, aspartame, luo han guo fruit extract, neotame, saccharin, stevia, and sucralose.

An on-line sensor integral with a laboratory-scale distribution system (LDS) was shown to respond rapidly to changes in residual free chlorine concentrations induced by injected loads of Escherichia coli suspended in a chlorine demand free buffer. The magnitude of the residual response was proportional to the injected cell concentration, the background free chlorine concentration in the LDS, and the contact time between the chlorine residual and the injected suspension, consistent with previous results in batch reactors. The magnitude of the residual response was predicted when kinetic models developed from reaction kinetics between free chlorine and E. coli determined in batch systems were evaluated at contact times determined from LDS hydraulics. This result highlights the suitability of using batch kinetics when modeling contaminant-induced chlorine decay in the distribution system.

AgNP reduced viability of G. fujikuroi conidia by 50% when directly exposed to concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 1.5 mu g mL(-1) for 1 to 20 min. Rice seeds infested with G. fujikuroi and treated with 150 mu g mL(-1) of AgNP significantly decreased colony-forming units (CFU) of G. fujikuroi on the seed surface when treated for 10 min and up to 24 h. Seed treatment with 150 mu g mL(-1) AgNP for 12 or 24 h significantly improved seedling emergence and height of G. fujikuroi-infested seeds. Adverse effects on germination rate and seedling growth were not observed with any of the AgNP treatments (<150 mu g mL(-1) for up to 48-h exposure) tested in this study.

However, little is known about its influence on preserving quality and the potential formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) under typical processing conditions. The suitability of aqueous chlorine dioxide (3 mg L?1) as an effective sanitizer of fresh-cut iceberg lettuce stored under active modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) at refrigerated conditions was determined and compared with sodium hypochlorite (100 mg L?1). Fresh-cut lettuce washed with tap water was used as a control. The epiphytic microbiota were characterized by the evaluation of the major relevant microbial groups such as mesophiles, psychrophiles, Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacteriaceae, lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and moulds. Additionally, gas composition, sensory quality, vitamin C and individual and total phenolics were monitored after washing and during storage for 3 d at 4 \u00b0C followed by 7 d at 8 \u00b0C. In general, the natural microbiota of fresh-cut lettuce after washing and storage was equally affected by the different washing solutions, with the exception of yeasts which showed the highest growth after 10 d storage in samples washed with chlorine dioxide. None of the tested washings negatively affected sensory quality, which was acceptable after 10 d storage. Additionally, the content of bioactive compounds was not significantly affected either by washing solution or by storage time. The potential formation of THMs was evaluated by the analysis of lettuce washed in water with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 700 mg L?1 treated for 30 min with sodium hypochlorite (100 mg L?1) or chlorine dioxide (3.7 mg L?1). Trihalomethane formation was only detected in the process water in which sodium hypochlorite was applied (217 \u00b1 38 ?g L?1). However, THMs formation in fresh-cut lettuce was negligible despite the sanitation procedure. The formation of THMs was only detected in fresh-cut lettuce when sodium hypochlorite was used under very extreme conditions where lettuce was washed in water with a high level of organic matter (COD = 1800 mg L?1), high sodium hypochlorite concentration (700 mg L?1) and long contact time (60 min).

The phenotype exhibited by these studies, that is, increased metabolic rate, resistance to high fat diet, and subsequent weight loss, has spurred considerable efforts to develop antagonists of MCHR1. In continuation of efforts directed toward this goal, the present work capitalizes on the putative binding mode of an MCH antagonist, resulting in the identification of several novel chemotypes that are potent and selective MCHR1 antagonists. In addition, the favorable pharmacokinetics of representative examples has allowed for the evaluation of an MCHR1 antagonist in a high fat diet-induced obese rodent model of obesity. The tolerability of the right-hand side of the template for diverse chemotypes accompanied by favorable effects on weight loss enhances the attractiveness of this template in the pursuit toward development of effective anti-obesity agents. \u00a9 2006 American Chemical Society.", "label": 0}

The polarization resistances, measured by electrochem. impedance spectroscopy of the C steel coupons, were evaluated prior to and during biocide treatments. Corrosion tubercles were obsd. on the C steel samples 4 days after inoculation with a consortia of 5 different physiol. types of bacteria. NaClO or NaClO/NaBr was then added to the vessels contg. the steel samples. Exposure to 2 ppm of residual Cl or residual Cl/Br for 2 h had little effect on the nos. of sessile bacteria or the bacterial metabolic activity, as measured by 14C-acetate incorporation into total lipids. Treatment for 2 h with 16 ppm of residual Cl or residual Cl/Br, followed by a 24-h treatment with 2 ppm of residual biocide, decreased sessile aerobic bacteria by 2 orders of magnitude and decreased sessile sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) by 3 orders of magnitude. Bacterial metabolic activity was decreased to the levels of the sterile controls following the 16 ppm treatment. Bacteria in the bulk soln. were reduced from ?5 \u00d7 107 cells/mL to <1 cell/mL following the 16 ppm treatments. The C steel admittance increased when samples were treated with the high concns. of biocides, compared to untreated controls. These results indicated that low levels of halogen biocide may be ineffective at reducing sessile bacterial populations in moderately alk. systems. Treatments with high concns. of halogen biocide, though effective at reducing bacterial nos. and activities, increased the corrosion rate of the C steel. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}

An overview of the importance of the decontamination in meat processing and microbial inactivation using ultrasound combined with some other applications is provided along with results of high power ultrasound studies which have been applied and adapted in the meat industry. The research results revealed that ultrasound by itself or in combination with other processing and/or preservation methods has a potential for improving the general quality, marination and tenderness of meat, preventing microbial growth and recontamination in meat and meat products as well as for the determination of defects in carcasses and cleaning process equipment. This review will provide an interpretation of ultrasound applications, an up-to-date summary of published articles, and an overview of the microbial inactivation in meat and poultry and their products by ultrasound. Since there is a need for not only a pathogen-free product but also a quality product; this review also can be accepted as a report on the results of research in the field of meat quality improvements with ultrasound applications.", "label": 1}

A new perspective for disinfection application of slightly acidic electrolyzed water was proposed in this study, namely the disinfection methods of \"liquid-liquid\". The effects of freshwater disinfection using slightly acidic electrolyzed water by means of continuously dynamic hybrid was evaluated. Under the different conditions of mixture, parameters variation characteristics of slightly acidic electrolyzed water including available chlorine concentration, pH and oxidation-reduction potential showed small fluctuations within a certain range and remained relatively stable. Compared with static mixture, the method of continuously dynamic hybrid had better sterilization effect. Under condition of static mixture, the disinfection effect of slightly acidic electrolyzed water to freshwater followed more sophisticated dynamic model. At different volume ratios, the correlation coefficients (R-2) were all greater than 0.9, which means that the model has good prediction effect. Under condition of dynamic hybrid, the variation of available chlorine concentration kept in a dynamic balance, which is in conformity with the zero-order kinetics model. The disinfection effect of slightly acidic electrolyzed water to freshwater followed first-order kinetic model, which also has better forecasting effect. The increase of temperature within limits contributed to promoting disinfection effect of slightly acidic electrolyzed water. But the disinfection effect became worse along with the increase of turbidity. The Escherichia coli (E. coli) inactivation effect under condition of mixture rendered slightly acidic electrolyzed water a promising disinfectant, which can be applied in freshwater to control natural microbiota.

Depending on the nature of substrates, this methodology provides an access for novel carbon-carbon linked chlorin-chlorin dimers and chlorin-porphyrin dimers with fixed and flexible orientations. The configuration of the linkers in the symmetrical and unsymmetrical dimers was confirmed by extensive NMR (COSY, ROESY) and molecular modeling studies. The molecular modeling studies of the energy-optimized dimers with flexible orientation confirmed that one of the chlorin units of the dimeric structure is tilted toward the opposite ring as evident by the shielding effect in the resonances of some of the protons in the 1H NMR spectroscopy. Among the dimers with fixed orientation, compared to the free-base analogues, the related mono- and di-Zn(II) complexes produced a decreased fluorescence intensity, suggesting a possibility of the faster energy transfer via intersystem crossing (ISC) in the metalated derivatives than the corresponding freebase analogues to produce the corresponding excited triplet states. The photosensitizing efficacy of the monomers and the related dimers was also compared in radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF) tumor cells at variable drug/light doses.

Two MgCa alloys below the solid solubility of Ca were considered, as to solely investigate the effect of Ca content on the behavior of magnesium and the pH changes associated to metal dissolution. X-ray diffraction analysis and optical microscopy showed that both Mg-0.63Ca and Mg-0.89Ca alloys were solely composed of alpha(Mg) phase. Degradation characteristics and electrochemical characterization of MgCa alloys were investigated during exposure to Ringer's solution at 37 degrees C by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy. The impedance behavior showed both capacitive and inductive features that are related to the alloy charge transfer reaction and the relaxation of the absorbed corrosion compounds, and can be described in terms of an equivalent circuit. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to view the surface morphology of the MgCa samples after 1 week immersion in Ringer's solution showing extensive precipitation of corrosion products, whereas the substrate shows evidence of a non-uniform corrosion process. Energy dispersive analysis showed that the precipitates contained oxygen, calcium, magnesium and chlorine, and the Mg:Ca ratios were smaller than in the alloys. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) was used to visualize local pH changes associated to these physicochemical processes with high spatial resolution.

HAV and HRV showed little inactivation in all conditions. PV showed more than a 4 log(10) titer reduction in the presence of copper and silver combined with 0.5 mg of FC per liter or in the presence of 1 mg of FC per liter alone. Human adenovirus persisted longer than PV with the same treatments, although it persisted significantly less than HRV or HAV. The addition of 700 mu g of copper and 70 mu g of silver per liter did not enhance the inactivation rates after the exposure to 0.5 or 0.2 mg of FC per liter, although on some occasions it produced a level of inactivation similar to that induced by a higher dose of FC alone. Virus aggregates were observed in the presence of copper and silver ions, although not in the presence of FC alone. Our data indicate that the use of copper and silver ions in water systems may not provide a reliable alternative to high levels of FC for the disinfection of viral pathogens. Gene probe-based procedures were not adequate to monitor the presence of infectious HAV after disinfection. PV does not appear to be an adequate model viral strain to be used in disinfection studies. Bacteroides fragilis bacteriophages were consistently more resistant to disinfection than PV, suggesting that they would be more suitable indicators, although they survived significantly less than HAV or HRV.", "label": 0}

This study determined the impact of the preservation technologies on sensory quality (weight losses, color, texture and sensory acceptability) and on the growth of indicator micro-organisms (mesophiles, psychrotrophs, anaerobic micro-organisms, sporeformers, faecal coliforms, Salmonella and Escherichia coli) in minimally processed artichoke packaged with five different films (two PVC and three P-Plus). The atmospheres obtained, together with the different permeability to water vapor of the films under study, determined the evolution of the visual and microbiological quality of the artichoke. For most of the batches, no correspondence was found between microbial growth and changes in appearance. Those batches where the equilibrium atmosphere was clearly anaerobic showed microbial counts below the legally established microbiological limits but also showed a rapid loss of sensory quality. On the other hand, some batches with an acceptable sensory evaluation had microbial counts higher than those allowed by the legislation. This last situation is particularly dangerous from a health point of view since it allows the growth of micro-organisms (even pathogens) although the product may seem to be acceptable for consumption. This lack of correspondence constitutes an important point to be attended to on the microbiological safety of these foods, since the preservation technologies applied allow the prolonging of their sensory characteristics but, at the same time, may favor the growth of micro-organisms.", "label": 1}

Displacement of CDDP chlorine atoms by hydrogens of carboxyl groups on polymer side-chains could give rise to mono-functional linkages capable of releasing the drug in favor of ligands exhibiting higher affinity toward Pt (II) (e.g. DNA, the target for drug activity in tumor cells). The CDDP-CM-dex complex, carrying up to 40 mol releasable CDDP per mol carrier was cytotoxic against ovarian carcinoma cells in vitro with activity comparable to that of free CDDP (1.5 times lower). Its in vivo toxicity was influenced by drug:carrier molar ratio with a direct correlation between drug load and toxicity (a complex of 15:1 was it-fold less toxic than CDDP). The CDDP-p-Glu complex (60 mol drug/mol p-Glu) was characterized by higher thermodynamic stability, its reduced in vivo toxicity was not affected by CDDP load and its in vitro activity was lower than that of free CDDP (2.6-fold). Both CDDP complexes were effective in suppressing the growth of human ovarian carcinoma (OVCAR-3) in athymic mice. Due to their decreased toxicity the complexes exerted a wider therapeutic dose range of activity (80% survival at 3-12 mg/kg) as compared to the narrow and inconsistent effective dose range of free CDDP (80% survival at 1-2.5 mg/kg).

In total, 73 regular samples were collected from key locations throughout treatment processes: post-preliminary, post-MBR, post-secondary, post-tertiary, and post-disinfection (UV or chlorine). Out of 19 post-preliminary samples, adenovirus by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was detected in all 19, enterovirus by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was detected in 15, and norovirus GI by qRT-PCR was detected in 11. Norovirus GII and Hepatitis A virus were not detected in any samples, and rotavirus was detected in one sample but could not be quantified. Although culturable viruses were found in 12 out of 19 post-preliminary samples, they were not detected in any post-secondary, post-MBR, post-ultraviolet, or post-chlorine samples. Median log removals for all organisms were higher for MBR secondary treatment (3.02 to >6.73) than for conventional secondary (1.53-4.19) treatment. Ultraviolet disinfection after MBR treatment provided little additional log removal of any organism except for somatic coliphage (>2.18), whereas ultraviolet or chlorine disinfection after conventional secondary treatment provided significant log removals (above the analytical variability) of all bacterial indicators (1.18-3.89) and somatic and F-specific coliphage (0.71 and >2.98). Median log removals of adenovirus across disinfection were low in both MBR and conventional secondary plants (no removal detected and 0.24), and few removals of individual samples were near or above the analytical variability of 1.2 log genomic copies per liter. Based on qualitative examinations of plots showing reductions of organisms throughout treatment processes, somatic coliphage may best represent the removal of viruses across secondary treatment in both MBR and conventional secondary plants.

This fact was used to determine the amount of water swallowed during swimming activity. Fifty-three recreational swimmers, using a community swimming pool disinfected with cyanuric acid stabilized chlorine, participated in the study.

Cyanuric acid was measured in pool water using high performance liquid chromatography and porous graphitic carbon columns with UV detection. The urine sample assay required a clean-up procedure to remove urinary proteins and interfering substances. Results of the study indicate that non-adults ingest about twice as much water as adults during swimming activity. The average amount of water swallowed by non-adults and adults was 37 ml and 16 ml, respectively.

To upgrade the hygienic safety of water softeners, the German DIN Standard 19636 was developed, to assure that the distribution system could not be contaminated by these devices and that the drinking water to be used in the household still meets the microbiological standards according to the German drinking water guidelines, i.e. among others heterotrophic plate count (HPC) below 100 CFU/ml. Moreover, the standard for the water softeners includes a test for contamination with Pseudomonas aeruginosa which has to be disinfected during the regeneration phase. This is possible by sanitizing the resin bed during regeneration by producing chlorine. The results of the last 10 years of tests of water softeners according to DIN 19636 showed that it is possible to produce water softeners that comply with that standard. Approximately 60% of the tested models were accepted. P. aeruginosa is used as an indicator for potentially pathogenic bacteria being able to grow also in low nutrient conditions which normally prevail in drinking water. Like other heterotrophs, the numbers of P. aeruginosa increase rapidly as stagnation occurs. Normally P. aeruginosa is not present in the distributed drinking water. However, under certain conditions, P. aeruginosa can be introduced into the drinking water distribution system, for instance, during construction work. The occurrence of P. aeruginosa is shown in different cases in treatment plants, public drinking water systems and in-house installations.

The purpose of this study is to incorporate the variability in inactivation kinetics among different lots of oocysts and to develop a statistical model for Ct based on first-order delayed Chick--Watson inactivation kinetics. A Bayesian approach is used to estimate the delayed Chick--Watson kinetic parameters. A log-linear regression analysis is then used to represent the effect of temperature on the resulting kinetic parameters.

Water and 5% horse serum were used as carriers for spore inoculum applied to the surface of stainless steel coupons, and 5% horse serum was used as a carrier for inoculum applied to apples. Inocula were dried on stainless steel for 5 h and on apples for 22 to 24 h before treating with sanitizers. At the concentrations of sanitizers tested, sensitivities of planktonic B. cereus and B. thuringiensis spores were similar. A portion of the spores surviving treatment with chlorine and, more markedly, chlorine dioxide had decreased tolerance to heat. Planktonic spores of both species were more sensitive to sanitizers than were spores on the surface of stainless steel or apples. At the same concentrations, chlorine was more effective than chlorine dioxide in killing spores in suspension and on stainless steel. The lethality of chlorine dioxide was markedly reduced when inoculum on stainless steel coupons was suspended in 5% horse serum as a carrier rather than water. Chlorine and chlorine dioxide at concentrations of 10 to 100 microg/ml were equally effective in killing spores on apples. Significant reductions of > or = 3.8 to 4.5 log CFU per apple were achieved by treatment with 100 microg/ml of either of the two sanitizers.

Elimination of preformed L monocytogenes biofilms by peroxyacetic acid also was tested. Adhesion control experiments were performed with pure cultures of L. monocytogenes after swab collection of adhered cells, which were then enumerated on PALCAM agar plates and visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Formation of a biofilm was recorded when the number of adhered cells was at least 10(3) CFU/cm(2). When L. monocytogenes was cocultured with E. faecium bac(-), the number of adhered L. monocytogenes cells was 2.5 log lower (P = 0.002) when initially compared with the control culture, but after 6 h of incubation a biofilm was again detected.

Although all tested conditions reduced L. monocytogenes growth to some extent, only coculture with E. faecium bac+ efficiently reduced biofilm formation, suggesting a potential control strategy for this pathogen.", "label": 0}
{"id": "1336", "title": "The progeny of Legionella pneumophila in human macrophages shows unique developmental traits", "abstract": "The Gram-negative bacterium Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular parasite of amoebae and an accidental human pathogen that causes a noncommunicable atypical pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease (LD). In some mammalian cells (e.g. HeLa), L. pneumophila follows a biphasic developmental cycle, differentiating between a replicative form that actively multiplies intracellularly, and a mature infectious form (MIF) that emerges as progeny. To date, it is not known whether the L. pneumophila progenies that emerge from amoebae and human macrophages reach similar developmental stages. Here, we demonstrate that in relation to the fully differentiated and highly infectious MIFs that emerge from amoebae, the L. pneumophila progeny that emerges from macrophages is morphologically undifferentiated, less resistant to antibiotics and less able to initiate infections. However, the L. pneumophila progeny from macrophages did not show any defects in intracellular growth. We thus concluded that macrophage infection with L. pneumophila yields a low number of bona fide MIFs. Because MIFs are the transmissive forms of L. pneumophila produced in vivo, our results showing that they are not efficiently produced in cultured macrophages provide an initial insight into why LD is not communicable. \u00a9 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.", "label": 0}

The aim of the study was to analyse biofilm levels of B. cereus by initially inoculated vegetative cells and spores on different polyurethane conveyor belts. The overall biomass of the biofilm was measured using the optical density of absorbed crystal violet dye in cells. Moreover, the efficacy of cleaning agents, ultrasound, and a combined method was tested. The results show biofilm inoculated from spores attaches to surfaces the most firmly, followed by wild and standard strains. We did not prove that material roughness or contact angle impact the overall biomass of the biofilm. Furthermore, an efficacy assessment shows that strongly attached biofilm from spores is more difficult to eliminate in comparison to biofilm from vegetative cells. Moreover, we determined that using either the cleaning agent or ultrasound had limited capacity for biofilm removal in comparison with the combined method. Therefore, prevention of food contamination should also include hygiene management of food contact materials. The bakery industry should plan to change cleaning procedures to those implementing hurdle technologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "label": 0}

Methods: An emulsification-coacervation method was adopted. The characterizations of chlorine dioxide-gelatin microspheres were described. Using UV-vis spectrophotometer the ?max of chlorine dioxide was observed at 358 nm. The particle size and distribution of chlorine oxide-gelatin microspheres was measured by a dynamic light scattering (DLS) method, the diameter was (1400~1900) nm. The entrapment of chlorine dioxide-gelatin microspheres was confirmed by IR. The surface morphology, size, and shape of chlorine dioxide-gelatin microspheres were analyzed using Scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results: It showed that the encapsulated microspheres size was around 2000 nm with uniform distribution. The percentage entrapment of chlorine dioxide in the encapsulated samples was about 80~85%. A slow release study of chlorine dioxide from the encapsulated biopolymer (gelatin) in air was also carried out, which showed continuous release up to ten days. Conclusions: It can be concluded that it is possible to make a slow release formulation of ClO2 by entrapped in a hydrophilic biodegradable polymer gelatin. ClO2-gelatin microspheres can stable release low concentration ClO2 gas over an extended period.", "label": 0}

Overall, hepatitis A virus and rotavirus showed less than 2.6 log10 titre reduction for concentrations of 1 mg/l of free chlorine. For free chlorine concentrations of 0.5 mg/l or lower, with or without copper:silver ions, both of these viral strains suffered little inactivation. Poliovirus showed more than 4 log10 titre reduction in the presence of copper: silver combined with 0.5 mg/l of free chlorine, or 1 mg/l of free chlorine alone. Copper:silver ions (700:70 mug/l) reduced the infectivity of poliovirus. Although adenovirus was more efficiently inactivated than rotavirus or hepatitis A virus, it persisted longer than poliovirus under the same treatments, and its infectivity was never completely removed. The addition of copper:silver ions to reduce the levels of free chlorine do not ensure the total elimination of viral pathogens from water systems.", "label": 0}

These infections require long and expensive treatment regimens. Recently, 2 new drugs, bedaquiline and delamanid, have been approved in several countries for use in adults with severe, difficult-to-treat MDR-TB, and it has been suggested that they could also be administered to children with MDR-TB and limited treatment options. However, no study has been completed on their efficacy. Patient concerns: This report describes a 12-yr-old child with XDR-TB who was cured after a 24-mo therapy regimen, which included delamanid. Diagnoses: The patient showed progressive clin. deterioration after 5 mo of treatment with the majority of anti-TB drugs available on the market. Interventions: After unsuccessfull treatment with several anti-TB drugs for 5 mo, he was treated with a regimen including for 24 mo. Outcomes: Direct smear microscopy of the gastric aspirates and gastric aspirate cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis became neg. after only 1 wk and remained persistently neg. During the 24-mo treatment, all blood test results remained within the normal range, no adverse events were reported, and cor. QT interval was always normal. A clin. and lab. control was performed 3 mo after discontinuation of delamanid, and the other drugs did not reveal any modification of both general conditions as well as lab. and radiol. findings. The patient was considered cured. Lessons: The pos. outcome assocd. with the favorable safety and tolerability profile showed that long-term therapy with delamanid can significantly contribute to treating apparently hopeless XDR-TB cases in children.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The populations of Salmonella in mono- or dual-species biofilms with P. aeruginosa on stainless steel (SS) coupons were determined before and after exposure to commercial disinfectant, 50 mug ml(-1) chlorine or 200 mug ml(-1) Ecolab((R)) Whisper V (a blend of four effective quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC)). In addition, EPS amount from biofilms was quantified and biofilm structures were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Antagonistic interactions between Salmonella and P. aeruginosa resulted in lower planktonic population level of Salmonella, and lower density in dual-species biofilms compared to mono-species biofilms. The presence of P. aeruginosa significantly enhanced disinfectant resistance of S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis biofilm cells for 2 days, and led to an average of 50% increase in polysaccharides amount in dual-species biofilms than mono-species biofilms of Salmonella. Microscopy observation showed the presence of large microcolonies covered by EPS in dual-species biofilms but not in mono-species ones. CONCLUSION: The presence of P. aeruginosa in dual-species culture inhibited the growth of Salmonella cells in planktonic phase and in biofilms, but protected Salmonella cells in biofilms from disinfection treatment, by providing more production of EPS in dual-species biofilms than mono-species ones. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides insights into inter-species interaction, with regard to biofilm population dynamics and disinfectant resistance. Thus, a sanitation protocol should be designed considering the protective role of secondary species to pathogens in biofilms on SS surface which has been widely used at food surfaces and manufacturers.", "label": 1}

There is a voluminous literature on the effect of antibiotics on resistance and persistence and we call for a greater focus in food microbiology on the effect of biocides in the same context. We also raise potential issues in development of resistance arising from \u201csource\u2013sink\u201d dynamics and from horizontal gene transfer. Redox potential is identified as crucial in determining microbial survival or death, and the recently postulated role for reactive oxygen species in signalling also considered. \u201cTraditional\u201d predictive microbiology is revisited with emphasis on temperature dependence. We interpret the temperature vs growth rate curve as comprising 11 regions, some well-recognised but others leading to new insights into physiological responses. In particular we are intrigued by a major disruption in the monotonic rate of inactivation at a temperature, slightly below the actual maximum temperature for growth. This non-intuitive behaviour was earlier reported by other research groups and here we propose that it results from a rapid metabolic switch from the relaxed growth state to the stringent survival state. Finally, we envision the future of predictive microbiology in which models morph from empirical to mechanistic underpinned by microbial physiology and bioinformatics to grow into Systems Biology.", "label": 0}
{"id": "3632", "title": "The dynamics of biofilms", "abstract": "The colonization of tissue and other surfaces by microbial cells results in the formation of a biofilm. The biofilm mode of existence results from selective pressures in the environment. Biofilms afford microbes greater access to nutrients, protection from antimicrobial agents and provide a buffer to changing conditions in the environment. Micro-organism that colonize a surface often compete with each other for resources but eventually form consorts which promote their survival. The population structure that develops within a biofilm on living tissue frequently reflects the health of the host organism and its surrounding environment. Displacement of a consort that is beneficial to the host by one that exhibits debilitating characteristics is a common feature of disease. A better understanding of the environmental factors that control microbial activity and population structure within biofilms should promote the development of novel approaches to control the undesirable effects of microbial colonization of surfaces relevant to medical, industrial and environmental processes.", "label": 1}

The contamination of foods and animal feeds with mycotoxins is a worldwide problem. We reviewed various control strategies to prevent the growth of mycotoxigenic fungi as well as to inhibit mycotoxin biosynthesis including pre-harvest (resistance varieties, field management and the use of biological and chemical agents), harvest management, and post-harvest (improving of drying and storage conditions, the use of natural and chemical agents, and irradiation) applications. While much work in this area has been performed on the most economically important mycotoxins, aflatoxin B(1) and ochratoxin A much less information is available on other mycotoxins such as trichothecenes, fumonisin B(1), zearalenone, citrinin, and patulin. In addition, physical, chemical, and biological detoxification methods used to prevent exposure to the toxic and carcinogenic effect of mycotoxins are discussed.

By using single-unit electrophysiological techniques, the present study demonstrates disparate neural adaptations in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) of anesthetized male and ovariectomized (OVX) rats after chronic (3 week) exposure to a benzodiazepine agonist. Unlike males, no reduction in SNr responsiveness to systemically administered diazepam was seen in OVX females after chronic treatment with diazepam-filled implants. In addition, OVX females did not show the compensatory increase in spontaneous firing rate observed in males upon administration of the specific benzodiazepine antagonist, RO15-1788. Sensitivities to locally (microiontophoretically) applied GABA1 benzodiazepine agonist (midazolam) and GABA antagonist (SR95531) were not affected by hormone-related factors or chronic exposure to diazepam-filled implants. These results indicate that male and OVX rats show divergent alterations in SNr responses to systemic administration of benzodiazepines after chronic benzodiazepine treatment which appear unrelated to intrinsic changes in responsiveness of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex.", "label": 0}

Fresh-cut lettuce is potentially at high risk of causing foodborne illnesses, as it is generally consumed without cooking. Quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRAs) are gaining more attention as an effective tool to assess and control potential risks associated with foodborne pathogens. This study developed a QMRA model for E. coli O157:H7 in fresh-cut lettuce and evaluated the effects of different potential intervention strategies on the reduction of public health risks. The fresh-cut lettuce production and supply chain was modeled from field production, with both irrigation water and soil as initial contamination sources, to consumption at home. The baseline model (with no interventions) predicted a mean probability of 1 illness per 10 million servings and a mean of 2,160 illness cases per year in the United States. All intervention strategies evaluated (chlorine, ultrasound and organic acid, irradiation, bacteriophage, and consumer washing) significantly reduced the estimated mean number of illness cases when compared with the baseline model prediction (from 11.4- to 17.9-fold reduction). Sensitivity analyses indicated that retail and home storage temperature were the most important factors affecting the predicted number of illness cases. The developed QMRA model provided a framework for estimating risk associated with consumption of E. coli O157:H7-contaminated fresh-cut lettuce and can guide the evaluation and development of intervention strategies aimed at reducing such risk.", "label": 1}

However, the irrigation of these vegetables, using wastewaters that have received inadequate treatment often carries unseen microbial pollution that becomes a high risk potential for humans. In the present research, two of the most consumed fresh vegetables cultivated in Mexico City were analyzed, lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and Mexican coriander (Eryngium foetidum). These vegetables are commonly consumed raw. The vegetable choice and the disinfection's method were carried out by the application of two tests to two hundred people in an aleatory form. Similarly, vegetable sampling was carried out by means of a random sampling from the cultivated areas in a chosen \"chinampa\" (from Nahuatl or Aztec, chinamitl, bulrush or cattail stalks lattice for hydroponics cultivation). Vegetable samples were transferred, in dark plastic bags and in cool boxes at 4 +/- 1.5 degrees C, to the laboratory. Microbiological analysis for Salmonella typhi, mesophilic microorganisms, and fecal coliforms were done according to the \"NOM-093SSA1-1994\" (Mexico). Results obtained demonstrated that samples treated with the most preferred disinfectant, a colloidal silver based one, had a partial elimination of pathogenic microorganisms found in both vegetables lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and coriander (Eryngium foetidum) samples (mesophyllic microorganisms from 200,000 to 96,500 UFC/g and from 175,000 to 125,000 UFC/g and fecal coliforms from 75 to 0.43 NMP/g and from 150 to 2.10 NMP/g, respectively).

Lettuce inoculated with 6.57 log PFU of MS2 was reduced by 0.5 to 1.0 log unit when illuminated with UV light alone for 20 to 60 s (12.64 to 18.96 mJ/ cm(2)). In contrast, a 3-log reduction in MS2 was achieved with 2% (vol/vol) H2O2 spray delivered at 50 degrees C. No significant increase in log count reduction (LCR) was observed when H2O2 and UV light were applied simultaneously. However, H2O2 sprayed onto lettuce samples for 10 s, followed by a further 20-s UV illumination, resulted in an LCR of 4.12 that compares with the 1.67 obtained with 200 ppm of calcium hypochlorite wash. No further increase in MS2 inactivation was achieved by the use of either longer H2O2 spray or UV illumination times. The extent of MS2 reduction was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased when the H2O2 spray was delivered at 10 or 25 degrees C compared with 50 degrees C. In the course of aerobic storage at 4 degrees C, lettuce treated with UV light and H2O2 (10 or 25 degrees C) developed discoloration (polyphenol accumulation) within 6 days. In contrast, lettuce treated with UV light and H2O2 at 50 degrees C developed less discoloration within this time period and was comparable to untreated controls. This study demonstrated that the combination of UV light and H2O2 represents an alternative to hypochlorite-based washes to reduce the carriage of viruses on fresh produce.", "label": 0}

Water disinfection treatments can be used to improve its microbiological safety. Growers should ascertain the minimum effective disinfectant doses able to achieve the desired microbiological goals. Furthermore, potential unwanted effects both on crop health and on chemical risks associated with the accumulation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) on the crop must be taken into account. The minimum effective doses vary depending on intrinsic factors (e.g. physicochemical characteristics of the irrigation water, concentration of the target microorganism) and also extrinsic factors (e.g. geographical and weather conditions). In the present study, different types of surface irrigation water were treated with various doses of a stable solution of chlorine dioxide (ClO2)(0.1-2.5 mg/L) at 21 +/- 2 degrees C for a contact time of I min. Escherichia coli concentration (before and after treatment) and the residual ClO2 (after treatment) were analyzed. Several water physicochemical parameters were measured (chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity, pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), conductivity and absorbance of filtered water samples at 254 nm (UV254)). Data obtained was used to develop a model for ClO2 decay and a model for E. coli inactivation by linear regression. The ClO2 decay model (adjusted R-2 = 0.93) included the initial ClO2 concentration and the UV254 as explanatory variables. The E. coli inactivation model (adjusted R-2 = 0.77) included the initial ClO2 concentration, the initial E. coli concentration, and the UV254 as explanatory variables. The development of these models would help growers in making decisions regarding the minimum effective doses they might use to treat their irrigation water when using a stable solution of ClO2 to reduce microbial risk of fresh produce.

Although the mechanism of electrochemical disinfection has been largely attributed to the action of electro-generated active chlorine, the role of other oxidants, such as the reactive oxygen species (ROS) *OH, O3, H2O2, and *O2- remains unclear. In this study, we examined the role of ROS in the electrochemical disinfection using a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode in a chloride-free phosphate buffer medium, in order to avoid any confusion caused by the generation of chlorine. To determine which species of ROS plays the major role in the inactivation, the effects of several operating factors, such as the presence of *OH scavenger, pH, temperature, and the initial population of microorganisms, were systematically investigated.

{"id": "4080", "title": "Comparative electrochemical inactivation of bacteria and bacteriophage", "abstract": "Electric fields and currents have been shown to be capable of disinfecting drinking water and reducing the numbers of bacteria and yeast in food. However, little research has been conducted regarding the effectiveness of electric fields and currents in the inactivation of viruses. The objective of this study was to compare the ability of bacteria and bacteriophage to survive exposure to direct electric current in an electrochemical cell, where they would be subject to irreversible membrane permeabilization processes, direct oxidation of cellular/viral constituents by electric current, and disinfection by electrochemically generated oxidants. Suspensions of the bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteriophage MS2 and PRD1 at both high (approximately 1 X 10(6) CFU or PFU/mL) and low (approximately 1 X 10(3) CFU or PFU/mL) population densities were exposed to currents ranging from 25 to 3 50 mA in 5s pulses. Post-exposure plaque counts of the bacteriophage were proportionally higher than bacterial culturable counts at corresponding current exposures. E coli and MS2 were then exposed to 5 mA for 20 min at both high and low population densities. The inactivation rate of E coli was 2.1-4.3 times greater than that of MS2. Both bacteria and bacteriophage were more resistant to exposure to direct current at higher population densities. Also, amelioration of inactivation within the electrochemical cell by the reducing agent glutathione indicates the major mechanism of inactivation in the electrochemical cell is disinfection by electrochemically generated oxidants. The implications of these results are that technologies relying upon direct current to reduce the numbers of microbes in food and water may not be sufficient to reduce the numbers of potentially pathogenic viruses and ensure the safety of the treated food or water.

However, the main issue with use of native gelatin based materials in practical application is their water soly. and poor thermostability as they are rapidly dissolved in warm soln. In order to improve their water-resistant ability and thermomech. performance, the gelatin bars or membranes were cross linked by chlorine dioxide (ClO2) vapor at room temp. An exposure of the gelatin materials in ClO2 vapor for 12 h generated a crosslinking extent sufficient to preserve their morphol. in 37 \u00b0C warm water for above 5 days. The crosslinking also led to improved thermostability and enhancement in mech. properties. Energy dispersion X-ray anal. indicated that no halogen substitution reaction happened in the cross linking reaction, and the residual Cl could be removed thoroughly by pretreatment. Cytotoxicity was evaluated based on a cell proliferation study. It was found cell expansion took place and linearly increased during the course of whole period of the cell culture. Thus the cross-linked material showed no toxicity to the cells. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

The frequency of occurrence of cysts was 77.8% for Giardia and 72.2% for Cryptosporidium in 18 raw water samples. Ten out of 13 samples collected from treated water samples showed the presence of cysts, while in 5 out of 13 treated water samples oocysts were detected. The risk assessment for adverse human effects arising from the presence of cysts and oocysts indicates the possibility of waterborne transmission of Giardia and Cryptosporidium infection in Taiwan if water is not adequately treated.", "label": 1}

Such an approach is likely to improve the therapeutic success also in photodynamic tumor therapy (PDT): discontinuous irradiation with dark intervals of seconds or even milliseconds seems indeed to increase the photodynamic efficiency. Therefore in vitro experiments with a laser light source, which can be programmed for irradiation pulses of different duration and shape, were performed to compare the delivery of regular rectangle pulses of 100 ms to continuous irradiation with respect to the efficiency of PDT. Mammary carcinoma cells (MCF-7) were incubated with the photosensitizers meta-tetrahydroxyphenyl-chlorine (mTHPC)\u00ae, Photofrin II\u00ae and with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), and exposed to continuous and pulsed laser light. The results obtained from two different cytotoxicity tests (tests for mitochondrial function and membrane integrity) demonstrate that at the same given total light fluence, irradiation with regular on-off light pulses and therefore 50% reduction of the power density causes double cytotoxicity of the tumor cells. This could be explained by diffusion processes of the molecular oxygen, of targets and/ or of oxidised products around the intracellular reactions sites. This method of efficiency increase could be used in clinical application.", "label": 0}

The alkyl derivatization of the hydantoin ring at its 5 position, while an essentially constant chlorine loading is maintained at the I position, has shown that there is little dependence of the antimicrobial efficacy against Escherichia coli O157:H7 on the alkyl chain length, in contrast to reported observations for biocidal quaternary ammonium salt derivatives. The stabilities of the derivatives toward hydrolyses and ultraviolet light exposure have also been found to not be dependent upon the nature of the alkyl substituent group. These observations led to the conclusion that the 5,5-dimethyl derivative would be recommended for use, since it is the least expensive alternative.", "label": 0}

CP-2 of CA/PEG-400 (80/20) was selected for further modification with TiO2 nanoparticles. The maximum salt rejection (95.4%) was observed for the membrane having 15% TiO2 nanoparticles. Further escalation of TiO2 concentration resulted in the agglomeration of nanoparticles which subsequently decreased the permeation flux. The test results demonstrated that the modified membranes had higher salt rejection and chlorine resistance, lower degradation profile, successful inhibition of Escherichia coli growth and facilitating permeation flux compared to the control membrane.", "label": 0}

Some chemical disinfectants such as chlorine have proved to reduce the levels of microorganisms even in complex matrices such as wastewater in combined sewer systems; however, some of them release toxic by-products into water bodies and increase costs of plant maintenance and repair. In this study, we determined if performic acid (PFA) disinfection units can be operated at decentralized treatment facilities and reduce bacteria, viruses, and protozoan parasites in combined sewer overflows (CSOs). The PFA dosing unit at the inflow of a CSO storage tank dosed a fixed flow volume into the inflowing stormwater and, thus, concentrations varied between approximately 12-24mgl(-1). The results showed a reduction of most hygienically relevant bacteria with mean removal efficiencies of 1.8log10 for Aeromonas spp. and 3.1log10 for E. coli. For viruses, however, reduction was only observed for somatic coliphages with 2.7log10. In this setting, PFA does not seem to be suitable to remove e.g. protozoan parasites such as Giardia lamblia. In terms of operation, dosing the substance is uncritical in decentralized facilities, but the PFA needs too much time to react with pathogens after being dosed into the overflow of CSO storage tanks and before dilution with surface water in most facilities.", "label": 0}

Oxidative stress and K+ loss accelerate Fas translocation into lipid raft microdomains inducing Fas mediated death signaling in these erythrocytes. Pathophysiological-based therapeutic strategies to combat against erythrocyte death were evaluated using garlic-derived organosulfur compounds like diallyl disulfide (DADS), S allyl cysteine (SAC) and imidazole based Gardos channel inhibitor clotrimazole (CLT). Methods Morphological alterations in erythrocytes were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. Events associated with erythrocyte death were evaluated using radio labeled probes, flow cytometry and activity gel assay. Mass spectrometry was used for detection of GSH\u20134-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE) adducts. Fas redistribution into the lipid rafts was studied using immunoblotting technique and confocal microscopy. Results Combination of SAC and CLT was better than DADS and CLT combination and monotherapy with these agents in prolonging the survival of erythrocytes during chronic Pb2 + exposure. Combination therapy with SAC and CLT prevented redistribution of Fas into the lipid rafts of the plasma membrane and downregulated Fas-dependent death events in erythrocytes of mice exposed to Pb2 +. Conclusion and general significance Ceramide generation was a critical component of Fas receptor-induced apoptosis, since inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) interfered with Fas-induced apoptosis during Pb2 + exposure. Combination therapy with SAC and CLT downregulated apoptotic events in erythrocytes by antagonizing oxidative stress and Gardos channel that led to suppression of ceramide-initiated Fas aggregation in lipid rafts. Hence, combination therapy with SAC and CLT may be a potential therapeutic option for enhancing the lifespan of erythrocytes during Pb2 + toxicity.", "label": 0}
{"id": "8290", "title": "Myeloperoxidase", "abstract": "Phagocytes respond to stimulation with a burst of oxygen consumption, and much, if not all, of the extra oxygen consumed in the respiratory burst is converted first to the superoxide anion and then to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Myeloperoxidase (MPO), which is released from cytoplasmic granules of neutrophils and monocytes by a degranulation process, reacts with the H2O2 formed by the respiratory burst to form a complex that can oxidize a large variety of substances. Among the latter is chloride, which is oxidized initially to hypochlorous acid, with the subsequent formation of chlorine and chloramines. These products of the MPO-H2O2-chloride system are powerful oxidants that can have profound biological effects. The primary function of neutrophils is the phagocytosis and destruction of microorganisms, and the release of MPO and H2O2 into the phagosome containing the ingested microorganism generally leads to a rapid microbicidal effect. Neutrophils from patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) have a microbicidal defect that is associated with the absence of a respiratory burst and, thus, H2O2 production. Neutrophils from patients with a hereditary MPO deficiency, who lack MPO, also have a microbicidal defect, although it is not as severe as that seen in CGD. MPO and H2O2 also can be released to the outside of the cell where a reaction with chloride can induce damage to adjacent tissue and, thus, contribute to the pathogenesis of disease. It has been suggested that pulmonary injury, renal glomerular damage, and the initiation of atherosclerotic lesions may be caused by the MPO system.", "label": 0}

Each apple was submerged in 100 ml of each treatment solution for 30 s, and the number of spores remaining were recovered and enumerated. The efficacy of chlorine solutions was enhanced by decreasing the pH to 6.5 (up to 5-log reduction, depending on apple variety). Peracetic acid solutions (50 and 80 ppm) resulted in a reduction of less than 2 log spores per g and had the same efficacy (P ? 0.05) as nonacidified chlorine solutions (50, 100, and 200 ppm).

The antifungal screening was done on Candida albicans (MTCC-183) and Asperigillus niger (MTCC-343) fungal strains. Results revealed that, compounds (7a), (7b), (7c), (7d), and (7e) showed very good activity with MIC value of 6.25-12.5 lg/ml against three evaluated bacterial strains and the remaining compounds showed good to moderate activity comparable to standard drugs as antibacterial agents.

UV, ozone and high pressure are non-thermal processing technologies that have potential to inactivate human pathogens on produce and allow the retention of fresh-like organoleptic properties. The objective of this study was to determine if UV, ozone, and high pressure are effective technologies compared to traditional chlorine spray on green onions to reduce enteric viral pathogens and to determine the effect of location of the virus (surface or internalized) on the efficacy of these processes. Mature green onion plants were inoculated with murine norovirus (MNV), hepatitis A virus (HAV) and human adenovirus type 41 (Ad41) either on the surface through spot inoculation or through inoculating contaminated hydroponic solution allowing for uptake of the virus into the internal tissues. Inoculated green onions were treated with UV (240 mJ s/cm(2)), ozone (6.25 ppm for 10 min), pressure (500 MPa, for 5 min at 20 degrees C), or sprayed with calcium hypochlorite (150 ppm, 4 degrees C). Viral inactivation was determined by comparing treated and untreated inoculated plants using cell culture infectivity assays. Processing treatments were observed to greatly affect viral inactivation. Viral inactivation for all three viruses was greatest after pressure treatment and the lowest inactivation was observed after chlorine and UV treatment. Both surface inoculated viruses and viruses internalized in green onions were inactivated to some extent by these post-harvest processing treatments. These results suggest that ozone and high pressure processes aimed to reduce the level of microbial contamination of produce have the ability to inactivate viruses if they become localized in the interior portions of produce.", "label": 1}

At the postevisceration site, 100 broiler carcasses were collected during 4 visits to a slaughterhouse in Santa Catarina State, Brazil. Birds were from the same flock, age, and approximately 2.4 kg of weight. Groups were as follows: group 1, with fecal contamination; group 2, without fecal contamination; group 3, with fecal contamination and trimmed; group 4, with fecal contamination and washed; group 5, with fecal contamination, and washed and trimmed. Carcass washings were performed with at least 1.5 L/bird of potable water (0.5 to 1 mg/kg of residual chlorine) at room temperature (20-25 degrees C) using spray cabinets with 44 spray nozzles distributed into 2 chambers (pressure of 2 kgf/cm(2) and 4 kgf/cm(2)). Washed carcasses (trimmed or not) showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower counts of aerobic mesophiles (plate count agar) on the third evaluation, and even lower (P < 0.01) counts for total coliforms (CT) and fecal coliforms (Escherichia coli). Trimmed carcasses showed significantly lower counts (P < 0.05) for plate count agar; however, we observed higher counts for E. coli (P < 0.05). The association of both treatments (washing and trimming) showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) counts for coliforms (CT and E. coli). We can conclude that the washing method is overall more efficient than the trimming method to decontaminate chicken carcasses at the postevisceration site. Hopefully, our findings can help poultry companies to minimize production costs by applying the washing method for carcass decontamination.", "label": 1}

These results suggest that the concentration of metal inside the field-collected periphyton, regardless of its species composition, is a good indicator of exposure and is an interesting proxy for bioavailable metal concentrations in natural waters. The presence of teratologies and metal-tolerant taxa at our contaminated sites provided a clear indication that diatom communities were responding to this metal stress.

The impact of various approaches for modelling the initial parameters of the model on the final risk assessments is evaluated. The Monte Carlo simulations that we performed showed that the occurrence of parasites in raw water was best described by a mixed distribution: log-Normal for concentrations > detection limit (DL), and a uniform distribution for concentrations < DL. The selection of process performance distributions for modelling the performance of treatment (filtration and ozonation) influences the estimated risks significantly. The mean annual risks for conventional treatment are: 1.97E - 03 (removal credit adjusted by log parasite = log spores), 1.58E - 05 (log parasite 1.7 x log spores) or 9.33E - 03 (regulatory credits based on the turbidity measurement in filtered water).

In situ hybridization experiments were performed with biotinylated PNA oligonucleotide probes with subsequent detection of the biotin label using a combination of Streptavidin-Horseradish Peroxidase and a tyramide signal amplification system. The results obtained enabled the specific detection of E. coli in under 3 h. Hybridizations were also performed on cells which were treated with chlorine (1.5 mg l(-1)) for up to 30 min. Escherichia coli cells were still detected after storage for 14 days at room temperature. No cells were detected by conventional plate count or the <<Colilert>> assay, a method currently used for the routine detection of E. coli and coliforms in the water industry. Cell viability was assessed by the ability of cells to reduce 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) to highly fluorescent formazan crystals through bacterial respiration. Only cells that had not been chlorinated were detected. These results confirm that ribosomal RNA exists within the cell long after cell death has occurred and that rRNA cannot be used to assess the viability of individual cells. However rRNA probes in combination with viability markers should enable the specific detection of viable cells in situ. Hybridization experiments were also performed successfully on seeded tap water samples. The number of fluorescent cells detected correlated well with those obtained by plate count analysis.

Also, a surface test method, which involved drying an amount of virus on a surface and then applying the inactivation methods for 1 minute of contact time, was used to determine the virucidal activity. Results H1N1 was completely inactivated to undetectable levels in 1 minute of 70% ethanol, 70% 1-propanol, and solvent/detergent treatments in the surface tests as well as in the suspension tests. H1N1 was completely inactivated in 1 minute of 0.1 mol/L NaOH treatment in the suspension tests and also effectively inactivated in the surface tests with the log reduction factor of 3.7.

In-vitro and in-vivo studies showed that posaconazole has broad-spectrum activity against most Candida species, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus species, Fusarium species, zygomycetes, and endemic fungi. Posaconazole is given orally two to four times daily. This triazole is widely distributed in the body, metabolised mainly by the liver, and is well tolerated, even in long-term courses. Adverse events are generally mild and include headache and gastrointestinal complaints. Posaconazole has shown promising clinical efficacy against life-threatening fungal infections that are often refractory to the currently available antifungal therapies\u2014eg, invasive aspergillosis, fusariosis, and the emerging zygomycosis.", "label": 0}
{"id": "3442", "title": "Mutagenic and carcinogenic properties of platinum-based anticancer drugs", "abstract": "Cisplatin (DDP) is currently one of the most effective drugs for the treatment of cancer. It causes primarily intrastrand DNA-DNA cross-links, and is highly mutagenic and carcinogenic in both in vitro and in vivo experimental models. There is, however, considerable variability between the response seen in different cellular systems, probably at least partly because of the different cellular DNA repair capacities. A number of analogues of cisplatin have been developed and one of these, carboplatin (CDDCA), is also in widespread clinical use. Although it is somewhat less toxic, there is no evidence that its mode of action differs from that of cisplatin. A limited amount of mutagenicity data suggests that it has similar mutagenic and carcinogenic consequences as the parent drug. Many further analogues of cisplatin are now in clinical trials, and some of these appear to have different DNA repair responses (and therefore possibly the development of clinical resistance). Although some (e.g., iproplatin and spiroplatin) are less mutagenic than either cisplatin or carboplatin, these appear to be the ones least likely to achieve wide use. There are insufficient data on several of the most promising clinical analogues (e.g., DWA2114R and ACDDP) to judge their relative mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. Detailed studies on the DNA repair and mutagenicity characteristics of these compounds will not only provide clinically relevant data, but may also aid in the selection of further useful antitumour agents in this series.", "label": 0}

We have developed an efficient treatment against post-surgical adhesions consisting of a combination of positively charged poly-L-lysine and negatively charged poly-L-glutamate. The aim of the present study was to further develop the concept of applying oppositely charged polypeptides in the prevention of adhesion formation, by evaluating different doses of the peptides, alterations in the way of administration, and also testing alternative components. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-five NMRI mice were divided into six groups. A standardized peritoneal injury model was used. The groups received physiologic sodium chlorine, poly-L-lysine+poly-L-glutamate, low molecular weight poly-L-lysine+poly-L-glutamate, locally administered poly-L-lysine+poly-L-glutamate, in vitro mixed poly-L-lysine+poly-L-glutamate and poly-L-arginine+poly-L-glutamate, respectively. After 7 days, the extent of adhesion formation was determined during relaparotomy and was expressed as the mean percentage of the total wound length. RESULTS: A significant decrease (p <0.001) in the peritoneal adhesion rate was detected in all groups, with the exception of the group administered poly-L-arginine. Among those animals that received poly-L-lysine and poly-L-glutamate, the low dose of poly-L-lysine administration resulted in the most pronounced anti-adhesive effect. CONCLUSIONS: The most effective polypeptide combination was poly-L-lysine and poly-L-glutamate, also showing effectiveness when used at low doses and by local application. The differences in adhesion prevention and the possible underlying mechanisms are discussed and the key role of poly-L-lysine is elucidated.", "label": 0}
{"id": "6807", "title": "The physiological role of reversible methionine oxidation", "abstract": "Sulfur-containing amino adds such as cysteine and methionine are particularly vulnerable to oxidation. Oxidation of cysteine and methionine in their free amino add form renders them unavailable for metabolic processes while their oxidation in the protein-bound state is a common post-translational modification in all organisms and usually alters the function of the protein. In the majority of cases, oxidation causes inactivation of proteins. Yet, an increasing number of examples have been described where reversible cysteine oxidation is part of a sophisticated mechanism to control protein function based on the redox state of the protein. While for methionine the dogma is still that its oxidation inhibits protein function, reversible methionine oxidation is now being recognized as a powerful means of triggering protein activity. This mode of regulation involves oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide leading to activated protein function, and inactivation is accomplished by reduction of methionine sulfoxide back to methionine catalyzed by methionine sulfoxide reductases. Given the similarity to thiol-based redox-regulation of protein function, methionine oxidation is now established as a novel mode of redox-regulation of protein function.

A standard suspension test was used to establish a rate of kill of these biocides against two stable isolates (Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus). Suspension tests demonstrated that 'in use' concentrations were not always effective to provide the required disinfection efficacy within recommended exposure times and in some instances a 60min exposure was necessary to achieve a reduction in number by a factor of 10(5). It appears that vegetative Gram-positive isolates can become resistant to oxidising agents in vitro, and that cross-resistance to related compounds can occur. Since these bacteria are deemed to be susceptible to highly reactive biocides, there should be further study of the resistance mechanisms in these isolates to explain their survival.", "label": 0}

Our aim was to determine ECM levels in response to subminimal inhibitory concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (sub-MIC/NaOCl) or anaerobic growth and determine the impact on biofilm development. Methods From 37\u00a0E. faecalis clinical strains, 19 were selected according to their biofilm-producing ability by using a crystal violet biofilm assay: 10 strong, 4 intermediate, and 5 non-biofilm producers. Biofilm assays were subsequently performed on all strains when subjected to sub-MIC/NaOCl. All strains were evaluated for ECM production under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and with sub-MIC/NaOCl. ECM production was assessed by using scanning electron microscopy. Double-blinded independent assessors were used to score levels of ECM production. The esp gene was detected by using polymerase chain reaction. Gelatinase activity was determined by using Todd-Hewitt and gelatin agar. Results In aerobic conditions, ECM was expressed in all strains. In the presence of sub-MIC/NaOCl, of the 10 strong biofilm producers, 5 increased their ECM production, and 4 showed increased biofilm growth. Two strains had less ECM production and showed decreased biofilm growth. One isolate demonstrated no observable changes. Most non-biofilm producers demonstrated no observable differences in ECM production, although 1 strain increased biofilm growth. ECM production in anaerobic conditions was highly variable. The esp gene (n\u00a0=\u00a015) and gelatinase activity (n\u00a0=\u00a07) were evident among the isolates. Conclusions Clonal diversity among strains of E. faecalis suggests that some strong biofilm producers can upregulate ECM production and increase biofilm growth in response to sub-MIC/NaOCl.", "label": 1}

To assess this issue, we conducted a literature review on QAC chemical structure, fields of application, mechanism of action, susceptibility testing, prevalence, and co- or cross-resistance to antibiotics. Special attention was paid to the effects of QACs on microflora; in particular, the issue of the potential of QACs for applying selective pressure on multiple-antibiotic-resistant organisms was raised. It was found that there is a lack of standardised procedures for interpreting susceptibility test results. QACs have different impacts on the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibacterials depending on the antibacterial compound investigated, the resistance genes involved, the measuring methodology and the interpretative criteria. The unmet needs for adequate detection of reduced susceptibility to QACs and antibiotics include (i) a consensus definition for resistance, (ii) epidemiological cut-off values and (iii) clinical resistance breakpoints.

Initial experiments were focused on comparing lethalities of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and ClO2. Eggs surface-inoculated with S. enterica in chicken feces as a carrier were immersed in water, NaOCl (50 or 200 mug/mL), or ClO2 (50 or 200 mug/mL) for 1 or 5 min. For 1-min treatments, lethal activities of sanitizers were not significantly different (P>0.05). However, after treatment with ClO2 for 5 min, reductions of S. enterica were significantly greater (P</=0.05) than reductions after treatment with water or NaOCl. The effect of treatment of eggs with ClO2 or NaOCl, followed by drying at 43% relative humidity and 25 degrees C for 24 and 48 h, were determined. Populations of S. enterica decreased during drying, regardless of the type of sanitizer treatment. ClO2 treatment, compared to water or NaOCl treatments, resulted in additional reductions of ca. >1.3 log CFU/egg during drying. This indicates that sequential treatments with ClO2 and drying induced synergistic lethal effects against S. enterica on the surface of eggshells. These observations will be useful when selecting a sanitizer to control S. enterica on the surface of eggshells and designing an effective egg sanitization system exploiting the synergistic lethal effects of sanitizer and drying.", "label": 1}

Cells exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of acid decontaminants (CA or PA) showed higher (P &lt; 0.05) anisotropy values and percentages of survival to acid stress than unexposed cells, suggesting that adaptation to these compounds is related to changes in membrane fluidity. Minimal changes in anisotropy values were observed after growth in presence of TSP or ASC. After treatment with strong concentrations of acid decontaminants (0.05 and 1% ASC, 5% and 10% CA, and 0.1 and 0.25% PA) the highest anisotropy values (highest membrane rigidity) were shown by cells previously grown with sub-inhibitory concentrations of CA or PA, suggesting that the synergistic effects of successive applications of various acids should be minimized.

Enhancing immunity to gastrointestinal nematodes through vaccination is desirable but mechanistic understanding of initial host responses that facilitate gastrointestinal nematode protective immunity is limited. We hypothesise that gastrointestinal nematode invasion induces mucosal epithelium damage and alarmin (e.g. IL33) release, thereby contributing to initiation of protective gastrointestinal nematode immunity. To test this, an in vitro air\u2013liquid interface human HT-29 epithelial cell-Trichostrongylus colubriformis co-culture system was developed. Exsheathed L3 T. colubriformis exhibited both sinusoidal and burrowing motions in the co-culture system. Burrowing parasites, but not ivermectin-paralysed larvae, induced necrotic death of epithelial cells (annexin V+/propidium iodide+/caspase 3/7?). Microscopy confirmed that larvae consumed labelled necrotic epithelial cell contents. Trichostrongylus colubriformis larvae and their post-exsheathment antigens (excretory/secretory products) significantly induced IL33 mRNA expression in the epithelial cells. Immunoblot confirmed that IL33 was released from epithelial cells due to the damage caused by motile larvae. Exposure of HT-29 cells to alum or Sigma proprietary adjuvants induced significant epithelial cell IL33 mRNA expression without inducing cellular necrosis. Hence, the intracellular contents were not released externally where they might exert alarmin activity and this may limit their ability to trigger a protective anti-gastrointestinal nematode response. We conclude that T. colubriformis motion at the infection site induces intestinal epithelial cell necrosis which facilitates the release of intracellular contents, including IL33, and may be fundamental to the initiation of an appropriate host response to gastrointestinal nematodes. Our co-culture model is useful for studying initial epithelial cell\u2013parasite interactions without conducting expensive animal trials.", "label": 0}

Recently, an electrolysis apparatus that uses only the chlorine normally present in municipal water, the Poseidon-S system, was developed as a novel additive-free disinfectant system to control microbial contamination in DUWLs. METHODS: The microbiological quality of water samples collected from DUWLs was assessed before and after installation of the Poseidon-S system in terms of the total viable counts (TVCs) of microorganisms. The microbicidal effects of the electrolyzed water against oral organisms and its cytotoxicity against human oral-derived cell lines were also examined. RESULTS: Water samples from the DUWLs initially had average microbial TVCs of 10(3)-10(6) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. After installation of the Poseidon-S system, the number of microorganisms in the water samples decreased to less than 1 x 10(2) CFU/mL. The electrolyzed water also exhibited remarkable microbicidal effects on the microorganisms present in the DUWLs as well as microorganisms commonly isolated from human oral cavities, but showed low cytotoxicity towards human oral-derived cells. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that routine use of the Poseidon-S system can effectively maintain low microbial levels in DUWLs.", "label": 1}

Reduced antibiotic susceptibility contributes to the persistence of biofilm infections such as those associated with implanted devices. The protective mechanisms at work in biofilms appear to be distinct from those that are responsible for conventional antibiotic resistance. In biofilms, poor antibiotic penetration, nutrient limitation and slow growth, adaptive stress responses, and formation of persister cells are hypothesized to constitute a multi-layered defense. The genetic and biochemical details of these biofilm defenses are only now beginning to emerge. Each gene and gene product contributing to this resistance may be a target for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents. Disabling biofilm resistance may enhance the ability of existing antibiotics to clear infections involving biofilms that are refractory to current treatments.", "label": 1}

However, few rigorous studies have investigated PSW quality in SSA, and none have compared PSW to stored household water for consumption (HWC). A clearer understanding of PSW quality in the context of alternative sources is needed to inform policy and regulation. As elsewhere in SSA, PSW is widely consumed in Sierra Leone, but government oversight is nearly nonexistent. This study examd. the microbiol. and chem. quality of a representative sample of PSW products in Freetown, Sierra Leone at packaged water manufg. facilities (PWMFs) and at points of sale (POSs). Samples of HWC were also analyzed for comparison. The study did not find evidence of serious chem. contamination among the parameters studied. However, 19% of 45 PSW products sampled at the PWMF contained detectable Escherichia coli (EC), although only two samples exceeded 10 CFU/100 mL. Concns. of total coliforms (TC) in PSW (but not EC) increased along the supply chain. Samples of HWC from 60 households in Freetown were significantly more likely to contain EC and TC than PSW at the point of prodn.

Compounds with antiviral activity were recently identified that bind to the N-terminal domain of CA (CAN) and inhibit capsid assembly during viral maturation. We have determined the structure of the complex between CAN and the antiviral assembly inhibitor N-(3-chloro-4-methylphenyl)-N?-{2-[({5-[(dimethylamino)-methyl]-2-furyl}-methyl)-sulfanyl]ethyl}-urea) (CAP-1) using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The protein undergoes a remarkable conformational change upon CAP-1 binding, in which Phe32 is displaced from its buried position in the protein core to open a deep hydrophobic cavity that serves as the ligand binding site. The aromatic ring of CAP-1 inserts into the cavity, with the urea NH groups forming hydrogen bonds with the backbone oxygen of Val59 and the dimethylamonium group interacting with the side-chains of Glu28 and Glu29. Elements that could be exploited to improve binding affinity are apparent in the structure. The displacement of Phe32 by CAP-1 appears to be facilitated by a strained main-chain conformation, which suggests a potential role for a Phe32 conformational switch during normal capsid assembly.", "label": 0}
{"id": "9364", "title": "Fate of free chlorine in drinking water during distribution in premise plumbing", "abstract": "Free chlorine is a potent oxidizing agent and has been used extensively as a disinfectant in processes including water treatment. The presence of free chlorine residual is essential for the prevention of microbial regrowth in water distribution systems. However, excessive levels of free chlorine can cause adverse health effects. It is a major challenge to maintain appropriate levels of free chlorine residual in premise plumbing. As the first effort to assessing the fate of chlorine in premise plumbing using actual premise plumbing pipe sections, three piping materials frequently used in premise plumbing, i.e. copper, galvanized iron, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), were investigated for their performance in maintaining free chlorine residual. Free chlorine decay was shown to follow first-order kinetics for all three pipe materials tested. The most rapid chlorine decay was obsd. in copper pipes, suggesting the need for higher chlorine dosage to maintain appropriate levels of free chlorine residual if copper piping is used. PVC pipes exhibited the least reactivity with free chlorine, indicative of the advantage of PVC as a premise plumbing material for maintaining free chlorine residual. The reactivity of copper piping with free chlorine was significantly hindered by the accumulation of pipe deposits. In contrast, the impact on chlorine decay by pipe deposits was not significant in galvanized iron and PVC pipes. Findings in this study are of great importance for the development of effective strategies for the control of free chlorine residual and prevention of microbiol. contamination in premise plumbing.

According to several studies, all-cause death risk is three to fivefold to that in the general population, and a somatic comorbidity was found in 30 to 60% of patients hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital, but was unknown in 50% of cases. Objective. - Our aim was to evaluate the interest of admission blood sampling analyses for the detection of somatic comorbidity, such as impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes mellitus, lipid abnormalities or infectious diseases among hospitalized psychiatric patients. Design. - During three months, laboratory tests (blood cell count, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, sodium, potassium, chlorine, urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and TSH) were determined in admission blood samples from 366 patients of two psychiatric hospitals. Then, according to the blood results, other biological tests (iron, ferritin, etc.) were made. Results. - For 194 of the 366 blood samples included (53%), at least one biological abnormality was detected. Moreover, variations in haematological variables, glucose and Lipid concentrations were the most frequent. We found that 45 (10.6%) of the patients had impaired glucose tolerance (glycaemia >= 1.10g/l), 21 (5.7%) had glycaemia >= 1.26g/l, and 76 (23%) had dyslipidemia (HDL-cholesterot <= 0.40g/l, LDL-cholesteroL >= 1.60g/l, or trigtycerides >= 1.50g/l). None of them had used glucose or cholesterol lowering drugs before the blood sampling. Furthermore, low haemoglobin concentrations were detected in 34 patients (9.3%) and high white cell counts (above 12g/l) in 26 patients (7.1%). Conclusion. - Despite methodological limits, these results showed the frequency of somatic comorbidity in patients hospitalized in psychiatric hospitals. Thus, admission blood sampling would be likely to improve the detection of somatic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, or infectious diseases.

However, in some preparations the yields of desired products were lower for bromine- than chlorine-substituted counterparts. A total of 12 bromine-, chlorine-, and mixed halogen-substituted 4-methyl-2(5H)-furanones were tested repeatedly in 10 independent experiments for levels of Salmonella typhimurium (TA100) mutagenicities. The purpose of these experiments was to determine the mutagenic response to changing halogen content, type, and position as well as to learn the measure of these responses in the presence and absence of the C-5 OH group. Mutagenicities reached levels of 10(3) and 10(2) rev/nmol for all trihalo- and dihalo-4-methyl-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanones, respectively, notwithstanding substitutions by bromine or chlorine. Trihalides lacking the C-5 hydroxyl group possessed mutagenicities of the order of 10(2) rev/nmol, while hydroxyl group absence in the dihalides resulted in potency levels of slightly less than 10 rev/ nmol. Pairwise comparisons of compound mutagenicities showed that overall the C-5 H-by-OH replacement and, next in importance, increasing the number of C-6 halogens from one to two resulted in the greatest enhancements of mutagenicities. However, in comparing compound pairs within two different sets of four di- and trihalides, it was observed that replacement of a C-5 H by OH enhanced mutagenicity more for the dihalides than the trihalides indicating that increasing the C-6 halogen number simultaneously with replacing C-5 H by OH results in a nonlinear, additive enhancement. For fewer than half of the compound pairs compared, changing the C-6 halogen from chlorine to bromine resulted in small increases in mutagenicity, and for the remaining compound pairs, no increase could be discerned. This result points to the relative unimportance of only C-6 halogen type as a determinant of mutagenicity. Similarly, no impact on mutagenicity was observed for changing only the halogen type attached to C-3.", "label": 0}

These methods suffice when determining probable consumer responses or meeting legislative contamination limits. However, in the often very costly, optimization process of a new method, more quantitative and unbiased results are invaluable. In this study, we employed a biophysical approach for the investigation of qualitative and quantitative changes in both food surface and bacteria upon surface decontamination by SonoSteam(A (R)). SonoSteam(A (R)) is a recently developed method of food surface decontamination, which employs steam and ultrasound for effective heat transfer and short treatment times, resulting in significant reduction in surface bacteria. We employ differential scanning calorimetry, second harmonics generation imaging microscopy, two-photon fluorescence microscopy, and green fluorescence protein-expressing bacteria and compare our results with those obtained by traditional methods of food quality and safety evaluations. Our results show that there are no contradictions between data obtained by either approach. However, the biophysical methods draw a much more nuanced picture of the effects and efficiency of the investigated decontamination method, revealing, e.g., an exponential dose/response relationship between SonoSteam(A (R)) treatment time and changes in collagen I, and a depth dependency in bacterial reduction, which points toward CFU counts overestimating total bacterial reduction.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of FSMS in the fresh produce export processing sector in Kenya as a case. The risk posed by the context in which they operate was assessed. An FSMS diagnostic instrument was used to evaluate thirteen fresh produce exporting processors based on indicators and descriptive grids for context factors, control and assurance activities and food safety output. Riskiness in context was diagnosed either as low risk, moderate risk or high risk. Performance of control and assurance activities was categorized as not conducted, basic, average or advanced. Food safety output was scored as either not done, poor, moderate or good. Majority of the processors (?7) operate at moderate level in most (74%) of the context riskiness indicators. Seven out of the 13 processors indicated that susceptibility of initial material to microbial contamination posed the highest risk with respect to product characteristics. Even though majority of the companies had advanced level core control activities performance for 6 out of 29 of the activities, there was a moderate performance in 48% of the activities and 24% control activities were not applied. Core assurance activities for majority of the companies also performed moderately in 89% of the indicators. FSMS performance was poor for 53% and good for 37% of the processors. All the processors had advanced scores for monitoring of pesticide residues but five lacked sampling and subsequent criteria for microbial analysis. The FSMS implementation for 77% of the companies was poor to moderate and, given the moderate context riskiness, this therefore resulted in moderate FSMS-output. The mostly moderate FSMS activity levels when assessed in the context riskiness lower the food safety performance of the fresh produce sector. Several recommended control and assurance activities in fresh produce sector should be improved to advanced levels in order to realize a stable and predictable safety output subject to the riskiness of context situation.", "label": 0}

Material and methods Fifty-four disk-shaped specimens (n = 18) were made for each resin (Lucitone 550, QC-20, and Classico) and assigned to two groups according to the type of polishing. Specimens were divided in three sub-groups in relation to sodium hypochlorite concentration (1%, 2.5%, and 5.25%), and the groups were immersed for 10-min periods in each sodium hypochlorite concentration. The electrochemical method used for detecting the release of sodium hypochlorite in each specimen was the cyclic voltammetry. Results In the specimens of Cl\u00e1ssico resin polished mechanically and immersed in 5.25% sodium hypochlorite, as well as Lucitone and QC-20 resins immersed in 2.5%, the amounts of disinfectant solution released in the four 15-min water exchanges were higher than the four 60-min exchanges. Conclusion There were differences in hypochlorite release from the three commercial brands of denture-base acrylic resins subjected to mechanical polishing. However, no hypochlorite release from the same resins was observed when they were subjected to chemical polishing.", "label": 0}
{"id": "7699", "title": "Application of electrolysis to inactivation of antibacterials in clinical use", "abstract": "Contamination of surface water by antibacterial pharmaceuticals (antibacterials) from clinical settings may affect aquatic organisms, plants growth, and environmental floral bacteria. One of the methods to decrease the contamination is inactivation of antibacterials before being discharged to the sewage system. Recently, we reported the novel method based on electrolysis for detoxifying wastewater containing antineoplastics. In the present study, to clarify whether the electrolysis method is applicable to the inactivation of antibacterials, we electrolyzed solutions of 10 groups of individual antibacterials including amikacin sulfate (AMK) and a mixture (MIX) of some commercial antibacterials commonly prescribed at hospitals, and measured their antibacterial activities. AMK was inactivated in its antibacterial activities and its concentration decreased by electrolysis in a time-dependent manner. Eighty to ninety-nine percent of almost all antibacterials and MIX were inactivated within 6 h of electrolysis. Additionally, cytotoxicity was not detected in any of the electrolyzed solutions of antibacterials and MIX by the Molt-4-based cytotoxicity test. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Here we investigated the effects of prior granular activated carbon (GAC) biofiltration [GAC-filtered water, unfiltered water, and a blend (30% GAC filtered and 70% unfiltered water)] and disinfectant type (chlorine, chloramine) on opportunistic pathogen occurrence using five annular reactors (ARs) to simulate water distribution systems, particularly premise plumbing. GAC pre-treatment effectively reduced total org. carbon (TOC), resulting in three levels of influent TOC investigated. Quant. polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) provided mol. evidence of natural colonization of Legionella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Acanthamoeba spp., Hartmannella vermiformis and Mycobacterium avium on AR coupons. Cultivable mycobacteria and amoeba, including pathogenic species, were also found in bulk water and biofilm samples. While q-PCR tends to overestimate live cells, it provided a quant. comparison of target organisms colonizing the AR biofilms in terms of gene copy nos. In most cases, total bacteria and opportunistic pathogens were higher in the three undisinfected ARs, but the levels were not proportional to the level of GAC pre-treatment/TOC. Chlorine was more effective for controlling mycobacteria and Acanthamoeba, whereas chloramine was more effective for controlling Legionella. Both chlorine and chloramine effectively inhibited M. avium and H. vermiformis colonization. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes in coupon biofilms revealed a significant effect of GAC pre-treatment and disinfectant type on the microbial community structure. Overall, this study provides insights into the potential of different disinfectants and GAC biofilters at the treatment plant and in buildings to control downstream opportunistic pathogens and broader drinking water microbial communities.

{"id": "3189", "title": "Ozone and chlorine dioxide: Similar chemistry and measurement issues", "abstract": "The chemical reactions associated with ozone and chlorine dioxide can be complicated and involve numerous intermediates. When ozone is applied, the presence of reactive intermediate species (O-2(-), O-3(-), OH, HO2, HO2-, and H2O2) influence the extent of oxidation that takes place and determines the amount and types of by-products formed. Similarly, when chlorine dioxide is applied the amount of intermediate (Cl2O2) formed determines whether chlorine dioxide producing reactions or chlorate ion forming reactions occur. Ozone and chlorine dioxide are excellent agents for inactivating Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Microbiologically, each of the agents are very reactive. In the case of ozone, typically each molecule undergoes a one-electron change. The mechanism of chlorine dioxide inactivation involves a recycling process whereby chlorine dioxide is reduced to chlorite ion followed by the \"regeneration\" of chlorine dioxide that continues to react within the cell over and over again. Chlorite ion also has oxidizing power and in some cases, is a biocide. When ozone and chlorine dioxide are used in combination, it is important that the chlorine dioxide application follow the ozone treatment to prevent the formation of unwanted by-products such as ClO3-.", "label": 0}

Rainfall (scarce and random) ranges between 50 to 300 mm with an annual mean of less than 100 mm. Irrigation water is highly scarce and groundwater (major part saline) is the main resource which ultimately causes soil salinization resulting in growth and yield losses of crops and desertification. Date palm is the major crop. Abandoning of date palm orchards has increased due to very low yields because of soil and water salinity. The situation required a systematic research. Therefore, this exptl. work was conducted to investigate the water salinity tolerance of important date palm varieties. The study was performed to screen tissue derived date palm varieties for tolerance to water salinity [Treatments: A. Categories of irrigation water: ECiw 3 (Control), 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 dS m-1 B. Date palm varieties: 'Khalas', 'Khunaizy' and 'Abunarenjeh']. A uniform dose of N=0.375, P=0.20 and K=0.30 kg plant-1 year-1 was applied. Growth parameters: plant height, plant girth, no. of new fronds and length of fronds were recorded annually for two years coupled with soil and plant anal. The research work was undertaken at the Agricultural Research Center (ARC) Rumais, Oman during the years 2006-08 (split plot design with four replications in a low EC sandy loam soil having very good drainage). Fresh water (EC 1.0 dS m-1) and the saline water (EC 35-40 dS m-1) were mixed in appropriate ratios to get the desired levels of ECiw. Data indicated a significant decrease in growth of all the three date palm varieties during irrigation for two consistent years with saline water of 6-18 dS m-1 when compared with 3 dS m-1. However, a 50% decline was recorded only at water EC 18 dS m-1. Therefore, date palm could be regarded as highly salt tolerant. Much difference between salt tolerance potential of the three varieties was not recorded, only 'Khunaizy' showed a little edge over the other two. A significant increase in leaf Na and decrease in K was obsd. while Cl remained unchanged. The physiol. basis of salt tolerance in date palm was found as a strict control on Na and Cl concn. in leaves and keeping up the K content. It can be recommended that Date palm plants (seedlings of varieties 'Khalas', 'Khunaizy' and 'Abunarinjah') can be irrigated with saline water during vegetative growth. However, a significant decline in growth will be expected when the EC of irrigation water exceeds 9 dS m-1 that may reach up to 50% with water EC 18 dS m-1 (in sandy soil with very good drainage). The research has to be continued on irrigation with saline water at later stages of growth; the reproductive, fruit setting and maturity stages. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

As a result, it was shown that chlorine dioxide gas under wet conditions was more effective in inactivating Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Gallinarum compared to that under dry conditions independently of the presence of organic matter (yeast extract). Under wet conditions, a greater than 4 log reduction in bacterial populations was achieved after 30 min of exposure to ClO2 each at 20 ppm, 40 ppm, and 80 ppm against S.

F'lac and hemolysin plasmids were eliminated by some substituted phenothiazines from E. coli at a very low frequency. The same phenothiazine derivatives also were synergistic with tetracycline in bacteria and shown antimutagenic effect in Ames test. No mutagenic effects were observed in TA 98 strain of Salmonella typhimunium. Chloroethyl-substituted phenothiazines showed antimutagenicity equivalent to the parent compounds; however, phthalimido-substituted phenothiazines had higher antimutagenicity of 50%. P-glycoprotein responsible for multidrug resistance was also inhibited in tumor cells. The accumulation of the fluorescent rhodamine 123 in the phenothiazine treated multi-drug resistant tumor cells was measured by flow cytometry. Some of the substituted phenothiazines were effective P-glycoprotein blockers, while some compounds had moderate activity, but others were without effect as compared to 5 microM verapamil. On the basis of computer analysis there are some correlations between the biological activities and the dipole moments, and entropy of the studied molecules. Our results suggest that the inhibition of Hly+ plasmid replication and P-glycoprotein function may depend partly on similar electronic properties of the studied phenothiazine derivatives. The activity of Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase was inhibited by the substituted phenothiazines, however, no basic differences were found in the activities of phthalimido- and chloroethyl substituted phenothiazines.

Twenty three physico-chemical parameters were involved in this analysis. Cluster analysis successfully clustered the Langat River into three major clusters, namely high, moderate and less pollution regions. Discriminant analysis identified seven of the most significant parameters which contribute to the high variation of Langat River water quality, namely dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, pH, ammoniacal nitrogen, chlorine, E. coli, and coliform. Discriminant analysis also plays an important role as an input selection parameter for an ANN of spatial prediction (pollution regions). The ANN showed better prediction performance in discriminating the regional area with an excellent percentage of correct classification compared to discriminant analysis. Multivariate analysis, coupled with ANN, is proposed, which could help in decision making and problem solving in the local environment.", "label": 0}

We isolated 161 microorganisms from soils, foods, and food-contact surfaces that are inhibitory to S. aureus. Among them, three CE microorganisms (Streptomyces spororaveus strain Gaeunsan-18, Bacillus safensis strain Chamnamu-sup 5-25, and Pseudomonas azotoformans strain Lettuce-9) exhibiting strong antibacterial activity and high growth rates were selected for evaluation. These isolates formed biofilms within 24 h on stainless steel coupons (SSCs) immersed in Bennet's broth and tryptic soy broth at 25 degrees C. Cells in these biofilms showed significantly (P <= 0.05) enhanced resistance to a desiccation (43% relative humidity [RH]) compared to those attached to SSCs but not in biofilms. The antimicrobial activities of biofilms formed by these isolates on SSCs against S. aureus at 25 degrees C and 43% RH were determined. Compared to SSCs lacking biofilms formed by CE microorganisms, populations of S. aureus on SSCs harboring CE biofilms were significantly lower (P 0.05). Results indicate that persistent antimicrobial activity against S. aureus on stainless steel surfaces can be achieved by the presence of biofilms of CE microorganisms. This information will be useful when, developing strategies to improve the microbiological safety of foods during storage, processing, and distribution by facilitating the development of effective antimicrobial food-contact surfaces.

Best spore inactivation conditions were found using [Fe(II)] = 2.5 mM and [H2O2] = 100 mM and UV-A radiation. Under these conditions, over 9-log inactivation was reached after 20 min of reaction. Interesting results were also obsd. for expts. carried out for low Fe(II) concns. or even when no Fe(II) was added and only H2O2 and UV-A radiation was used to evaluate microorganism inactivation. In the last cases, a lag phase was obsd. during earlier stages of the disinfection process and much lower spore viability was detd. after longer irradn. times. The effect of ionic strength and natural org. matter (NOM) was also tested in the spore inactivation kinetic. It was noticed that important differences occurred as a result of variation in the soln. ionic strength as well as from the presence of NOM. In both cases, an important decrease on the inactivation rate was obsd. Exptl. data fitted fairly well using a modification of the delayed Chick-Watson inactivation kinetics and the values of the rate const. used to perform an objective comparison among the different exptl. assessment were carried out.

Single (1-day) and multiple (7- and 14-days) administrations of 60 mg/kg AEO generated significant sedative effect on inhibiting locomotor activity and hypnotic effect on pentobarbital-induced sleeping in mice. Interestingly, prolonged AEO treatment did not result in obvious desensitization. Concoitant measurement of the levels of brain neurotransmitters using ultrafast liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS) indicated that AEO had no significant effect on the levels of glutamic acid (Glu) and -aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. However, the sedative-hypnotic effects were blocked by the type A GABA (GABA(A)) receptor antagonists bicuculline and flumazenil. In addition, AEO significantly elevated the expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits and subtypes in the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, AEO increased chlorine ion (Cl-) influx through GABA(A) receptors in human neuroblastoma cells. These results together demonstrate that AEO exerts its sedative-hypnotic effects through regulating gene expression of GABA(A) receptors and potentiating GABA(A) receptor function.", "label": 0}

The Bacillus subtilis spore, which has often been used as a surrogate microorganism for Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, was used as a target microorganism. Compared to individual unit processes with ozone or UV, the inactivation of B. subtilis spores by the combined ozone/UV process was enhanced under identical conditions. To investigate the specific roles of ozone and UV in the combined ozone/UV process, sequential ozone-UV and UV-ozone processes were tested for degrees of inactivation. Additionally, the experiment was performed in the presence and absence of tert-butyl alcohol, which acted as a hydroxyl radical scavenger to assess the role of inactivation by the hydroxyl radical in the combined ozone/UV process. Among the five candidate processes, the greatest synergistic effect was observed in the combined ozone/UV process.

The experimental results showed that the photoelectrocatalysis is a quite efficient process for decontaminating the produced water, although there are high concentration of salt existed in oilfield wastewater. We found that the COD removal efficiencies by photoelectrocatalytic process are much higher than that of by photocatalytic or electrochemical oxidation individually in the photoelectrocatalytic reactor. The COD removal can be substantially improved by the added H2O2 and the generation of active chlorine from high concentration chlorides in the wastewater. The effects of various operating conditions, such as initial COD concentration, applied cell voltage, catalyst amount and initial pH value of solution, on the photoelectrocatalytic efficiencies, is also investigated in detail.

The amt. of residual chlorine was detd. using DPD lovibond method which is effective, accurate and less cumbersome. The pour plate method was used to detect the growth of Salmonellae Shigellae, total coliforms and other microbes that could be present in the stored water. With time, the stored water dechlorinates. After three days the residual chlorine of the stored water had completely diminished thereby supporting massive microbial growth. The study reviews the causes of stored water contamination and prescribes measures to make the source safe to the end users. The study also highlights that the best length of time for storing water in tanks for consumption for people of the locality is three days. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}

MATERIALS AND RESULTS: The action of SOC on the metabolism, membrane and DNA integrity of Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 was studied. In both pathogens, there was an oxidative burst and depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) upon initial exposure to 200 ppm SOC. Metabolic activity, measured via bioluminescence, decreased over a 4-h period in E. coli O157:H7 ph1 cells exposed to SOC. Membrane integrity, assessed through viability staining, decreased progressively over 23 h when exposed to SOC. The appearance of auxotrophic mutants suggested that DNA damage had also occurred. Enzymes rich in disulfide bonds (alkaline phosphatase and protease) were sensitive to the chlorite-based sanitizer. Through challenging other microbial types, it was found that Gram positive had higher tolerance to SOC than Gram negatives with the exception of Salmonella. MS2 bacteriophage was highly sensitive; however, Bacillus endospores were not inactivated by SOC. CONCLUSIONS: SOC inactivates E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella through GSH oxidation and disruption of disulfide bonds. Ultimately, membrane damage resulting from prolonged exposure to SOC leads to the loss of cell viability. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results provide a basis for understanding why extended treatment times are required to inactivate bacteria using SOC.", "label": 0}

Prosthetic devices, catheters and shunts placed inside human body are prone to bacterial colonization, leading to biofilm formation. Biofilm control in industrial and biomedical settings share certain commonalities. Provision of inimical concns. of antimicrobials in the close proximity of the surface to be protected (with the bulk fluid being largely spared) is a desirable strategy. Accordingly, we have developed an antibiotic-enzyme loaded polymer composite, nitrogen oxides releasing wound dressings and a biocide releasing polymer capable of controlled release of antimicrobials for effectively curtailing biofilm growth. Interestingly, this work has emerged as an offshoot of our mainstream work on biofilm/biofouling control in cooling water systems. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

The virgin flat-sheet polyamide membranes were modified in situ with dilute P(NIPAM-co-Am) aqueous solution, and the modified membranes were then tested for their acid stability and chlorine resistance through long-term cross-flow permeation tests with aqueous solution containing 0.5 mol/l HCl and 2000 ppm NaCl and chlorine exposure experiments with hypochlorite aqueous solutions of different concentrations, respectively. The membrane properties were characterized in terms of reverse osmosis performance and surface chemical structure. The membrane modification was found to improve the chlorine tolerance and acid stability significantly. The P (NIPAM-co-Am) surface coating layer would impede the hydrolysis and the replacement of hydrogen with chlorine on the amide groups of the aromatic polyamide thin-film through enhancing intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and prevent the attack of acid and chlorine on the underlying polyamide film as a protective and sacrificial layer. The P(NIPAM-co-Am)-coated membrane would offer a potential use as a new type of thin-film composite polyamide membrane with improved acid stability and chlorine resistance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This study used a QMRA model developed by Health Canada to compare 14 scenarios created to assess the increase in risk due to potential treatment failures and unexpected variations in water quality and operating parameters of a water treatment plant. Under regular operating conditions, the annual risk of illness was found to be substantially lower than the acceptable limit. Scenario-based QMRA was shown to be useful in demonstrating which hypothetical treatment failures would be the most crit., resulting in an increased risk of illness. The anal. demonstrated that scenarios incorporating considerable failure in treatment processes resulted in risk levels surpassing the acceptable limit. This reiterates the importance of robust treatment processes and the multi-barrier approach voiced in drinking water safety studies. Knowing the probability of failure, and the risk involved, allows designers and operators to make effective plans for response to treatment failures and/or recovery actions involving potential exposures. This ensures the appropriate allocation of financial and human resources. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

Some of these DBPs are found to be respiratory and ocular irritant and might be assocd. with asthma, or might even be carcinogenic. As DBPs in swimming pools are formed from bather-shed-pollutants, a redn. of these pollutants will lead to a redn. of DBPs. Until now, however, the release of pollutants by bathers has not been studied in detail. The study described in this paper focuses on the release of these pollutants, further called anthropogenic pollutants. The objective was to define and quantify the initial anthropogenic pollutants, by using a standardized shower cabin and a standardized showering protocol in lab. time-series expts. and on-site expts. in swimming pools. The time-series expts. resulted in a definition of the initial anthropogenic pollutant release: the amt. of pollutants released from a person in a standardized shower cabin during the first 60 s of showering. The data from the time-series expts. were used to create a model of pollutant release. The model can be used to predict the initial anthropogenic pollutant release as well as the effects of showering. On-site expts. were performed at four different swimming pools, including one outdoor pool. Results of these on-site showering expts. correspond with the time-series and model outcomes. Anthropogenic pollutant release (both chem. and microbiol.) in swimming pool water can be reduced by pre-swim showering, very likely resulting in decreased DBPs formation and chlorine demand.

The aim of this work was to characterize the complex pharmacokinetics of favipiravir in nonhuman primates (NHPs) in order to guide future efficacy studies of favipiravir in large-animal models. Four different studies were conducted in 30 uninfected cynomolgus macaques of Chinese (n = 17) or Mauritian (n = 13) origin treated with intravenous favipiravir for 7 to 14 days with maintenance doses of 60 to 180 mg/kg of body weight twice a day (BID). A pharmacokinetic model was developed to predict the plasma concentrations obtained with different dosing regimens, and the model predictions were compared to the 50% effective concentration (EC50) of favipiravir against several viruses. Favipiravir pharmacokinetics were described by a model accounting for concentrationdependent aldehyde oxidase inhibition. The enzyme-dependent elimination rate increased over time and was higher in NHPs of Mauritian origin than in those of Chinese origin. Maintenance doses of 100 and 120 mg/kg BID in Chinese and Mauritian NHPs, respectively, are predicted to achieve median trough plasma free concentrations above the EC 50 for Lassa and Marburg viruses until day 7. For Ebola virus, higher doses are required. After day 7, a 20% dose increase is needed to compensate for the increase in drug clearance over time. These results will help rationalize the choice of dosing regimens in future studies evaluating the antiviral effect of favipiravir in NHPs and support its development against a variety of HF viruses.", "label": 0}

The purpose of this paper is to identify the chemical and microbiological characteristics of drinking water source of Cankiri City (as raw and purified) and tap water samples of central Cankiri and its towns. The water quality in Cankiri Province was evaluated by comparing these parameters with permissible limits set by Turkish legislation and World Health Organization (WHO). Raw and purified water samples were analyzed for chemical and microbiological qualities, trace metal, pesticide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), trihalomethane (THM), and benzene contents. These analyses indicated that the parameters exceeded those of the Turkish legislation (phenolic substance, biochemical O-2 demand, Mn, Se, fecal coliform) and the WHO guidelines (pH, phenolic substance, Cd, Se, fecal coliform). In this study, tap water samples were also collected from 50 sampling sites from central Cankiri and its towns during 2010. In these samples, chemical characteristics (bromide, free chlorine, nitrate and nitrite), carbamate, herbicide and fungicide contents, and microbiological contaminants were investigated. In the tap water samples, it was found that free chlorine concentrations exceeded the Turkish guidelines. Escherichia coli, total coliform and enterococci were used as indicators of possible sewage contamination due to inappropriate water distribution. Our results also indicated that significant microbiological contaminations in the tap water samples were above the guidelines for drinking water given by the Turkish legislation and WHO, and might pose a health risk. This investigation of drinking water samples of the Cankiri Province would point to the need of a new drinking water treatment strategy to ensure the safety of consumers.", "label": 0}

Water samples were also characterized in terms of some chemical and physico-chemical parameters of relevance in chlorination management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Both producers use water with maximum 1 ppm free chlorine for vegetables rinsing, while the two processes differ by the number of washing cycles. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Salmonella spp and Campylobacter spp were detected once in two different irrigation water samples out of nine from one producer. No pathogens were found in the vegetable samples. As expected, the procedure encompassing more washing cycles performed slightly better in terms of total mesophilic count (TMC) when comparing unprocessed and RTE vegetables of the same batch. However, data suggest that low-level chlorination may be insufficient in preventing microbial build-up in the washing equipment and/or batch-to batch cross-contamination.", "label": 1}

Technical considerations include the home infrastructure, as well as required plumbing modifications and electrical hook-ups. Methods: Twenty home HD installations were supported for the London Daily/Nocturnal Hemodialysis Study. The Fresenius 2008H (Fresenius Medical Care, North America, Lexington, MA) HD machine was used for all home HD installations in conjunction with a Service Deionization Tank (SDI) water treatment system composed of pretreatment, purification, and posttreatment components. To ensure that SDI systems provided high-quality water and dialysate, standard bacteriological testing was performed throughout the study, and patient serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were tracked as an indicator of nonspecific inflammation. Results: The annual number of hours of work required for each home HD installation and service/maintenance was approximately 75 and 58 hours, respectively. Water quality proved high because there were only 4 occurrences of failed endotoxin and bacterial tests; all were subsequently retested and provided satisfactory results. Serum CRP levels showed no significant difference comparing home HD patients with conventional in-center HD control patients. Conclusion: Although support of 20 home HD installations was economically feasible within the constraints of the London Health Sciences Centre Department of Biomedical Engineering, resources were strained by the final year of the study. This suggests that any sustained growth beyond the current study design may require a review of staffing, resources, and model of service delivery needs.", "label": 0}

This study investigated the loss of free chlorine (FC - the major germicidal component in MLAEW) over distance during spraying, as affected by air temperature and initial FC concentration. The anti-microbial effect of MLAEW on airborne bacteria from an aviary laying-hen house was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MLAEW was prepared at two FC concentrations: app. 15 and 60 mg L(-)(1), and sprayed at three air temperatures (18, 25, 32 degrees C). The original MLAEW solution and MLAEW aerosols collected at 0, 25, and 50 cm from the spray nozzle were analyzed for FC concentrations. Bacteria were immersed into these MLAEW samples and numerated for viable count after 0.5, 2 and 5-min treatments. RESULTS: MLAEW aerosols collected at 0 cm lost 11.7-13.2% FC, compared with the original MLAEW solution. This initial loss was affected neither by the initial FC concentration (P = 0.13) nor by air temperature (P = 0.57). The rate of FC loss during travelling was 0.79-0.87 % per cm of aerosol travel distance (% cm(-)(1)) at 18 degrees C, 1.08-1.15 % cm(-)(1) at 25 degrees C, and 1.35-1.49% cm(-)(1) at 32 degrees C. This travelling loss was affected by air temperature (P = 0.02), but not by initial FC concentration (P = 0.38). Bacteria were completely inactivated at 0.5 min when treated with MLAEW samples with FC > 16.8 mg L(-)(1), in 2 min when FC > 13.8 mg L(-)(1), and in 5 min when FC > 7.2 mg L(-)(1). CONCLUSION: Airborne bacteria from aviary hen house can be effectively inactivated by MLAEW with adequate FC concentration and contact time. During spraying, the anti-microbial efficacy of MLAEW aerosols decreased over distance due to FC loss which exacerbated at higher air temperatures.", "label": 1}

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether early anti-inflammatory treatment can protect against the delayed symptoms in Cl2-exposed mice.BALB/c mice were exposed by nose-only inhalation using 200ppm Cl2 during 15min. Assessment of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), inflammatory cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage, occurrence of lung edema and lung fibrosis were analyzed 24h or 14days post-exposure. A single dose of the corticosteroid dexamethasone (10 or 100mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 1, 3, 6, or 12h following Cl2 exposure.High-dose of dexamethasone reduced the acute inflammation if administered within 6. h after exposure but treated animals still displayed a significant lung injury. The effect of dexamethasone administered within 1. h was dose-dependent; high-dose significantly reduced acute airway inflammation (100. mg/kg) but not treatment with the relatively low-dose (10. mg/kg). Both doses reduced AHR 14. days later, while lung fibrosis measured as collagen deposition was not significantly reduced.The results point out that the acute inflammation in the lungs due to Cl2 exposure only partly is associated with the long-term AHR. We hypothesize that additional pathogenic mechanisms apart from the inflammatory reactions contribute to the development of long-term airway dysfunction. By using this mouse model, we have validated early administration of corticosteroids in terms of efficacy to prevent acute lung injury and delayed symptoms induced by Cl2 exposure. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc..", "label": 0}

Fluidized bed combustors are commonly used when co-firing, however, even if FBC have a wide tolerance for different fuel qualities, co-combustion of biomass or firing biomass alone may lead to unwanted ash-related problems. A deposit measurement campaign was done, at the 550 MWth biofueled CFB in Jakobstad, Finland. During the campaign a total of 16 different fuel blends were burned. The deposits were sampled with air-cooled probes with detachable rings. The deposits were sampled at two different locations, one where the flue gas temp. was about 730\u00b0C (probe surface temp. 540\u00b0C) and the second where the flue gas temp. was about 530\u00b0C (probe surface temp. 350\u00b0C). From every deposit sample three elemental analyses were done - one from the wind side, one from the lee side, and one from an angle of about 50\u00b0 from the wind side. The analyses were done with a SEM/EDX analyzer. The fuels used during the measurement campaigns were sampled and analyzed.

We studied indicator microorganisms in fresh vegetables from \u201cfarm to fork\u201d in Rwanda, to identify possible trends in microbial counts along the supply chain in a developing country. A total of 453 samples were taken across the vegetable supply chain (farm, market and food service establishment level) and analyzed for indicator microorganisms; Enterobacteriaceae, Listeria spp., aerobic plate count and coagulase - positive staphylococci. The sampling at farm and market covered 11 types of vegetables commonly eaten raw in salads. Results show that the mean count of Enterobacteriaceae and Listeria spp. in vegetables were respectively 5.8 and 4.6 log cfu/g at farm, 6.3 and 4.9 log cfu/g at market, 6.0 and 5.1 log cfu/g upon arrival at food service establishments, and finally 3.3 and 2.9 log cfu/g in ready-to-eat salads. Aerobic plate count and coagulase-positive Staphylococci were on average 6.8 and 4.6 respectively at start of salad preparation and 4.9 and 3.0 in the final product.

Understanding the phys. and chem. characteristics of NOM is essential to improving drinking water treatment processes. The size of NOM has important implications for drinking water treatment and the formation of DBPs, where the high mol. wt., hydrophobic components of NOM have been found to be effectively removed by conventional drinking water treatment processes, while the lower mol. wt. and certain hydrophilic components of NOM are more difficult to remove using these processes. In our study, we collected raw (untreated) waters from three different drinking water reservoirs, characterised the mol. wt. (MW) distribution of the NOM in these waters using anal. scale high performance size exclusion chromatog. (HPSEC), and isolated apparent MW (AMW) fractions of the NOM using preparative scale HPSEC. We also investigated the reactivity of the AMW fractions of NOM in terms of disinfection byproducts (DBP) formation potential from chlorination and chloramination. We focused on the formation potential of halogen-specific adsorbable org. halogen (AOX) and nitrogen-contg. DBPs (N-DBPs), since brominated and iodinated DBPs and N-DBPs have been reported to be significantly more cytotoxic, genotoxic, and carcinogenic than the regulated DBPs. Our study found that the AMW fractions of NOM with higher SUVA254 values generally produced higher concns. of halogenated DBPs, measured as halogen-specific AOX. Halogenated N-DBPs formed only a small fraction of AOX in both chlorination and chloramination, with higher relative contributions from halogenated N-DBPs in chloraminated samples. The propensity of the formation of N-DBPs, esp. N-nitrosamines and haloacetamides, was higher in chloramination. Since these DBPs are more toxic than the regulated DBPs, further evaluation of the health risk trade-offs when selecting chlorine or chloramine as a disinfectant is essential. The size of NOM had little influence on the formation of halogenated N-DBPs, but the low to medium AMW fractions of NOM tended to form higher concns. of N-nitrosamines. Chlorine tended to be incorporated into the higher AMW fractions of NOM, while bromine and iodine seemed to be preferentially incorporated into the lower AMW fractions of NOM. Since conventional water treatment processes are ineffective for the removal of the low to medium MW fractions of NOM, improved water treatment processes may be needed to minimise the formation of brominated and iodinated DBPs, as well as N-nitrosamines, esp. for source waters that contain significant amts. of org. matter of low to medium MW.

There are numerous application areas of ozone in the industry such as food surface hygiene, sanitation of food plant equipment, reuse of waste water, treatment and lowering biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of food plant waste. Treating fruits and vegetables with ozone has been found to increase shelf-life of the products. Notably, when ozone is applied to food, it leaves no residues since it decomposes quickly. In this review, use of ozone in food industry was discussed.", "label": 0}

Storage in copper containers can potentially prevent this type of contamination, but the inactivation kinetics of viruses by copper need to be described to make appropriate storage recommendations. This work characterized inactivation kinetics of bacteriophage MS2 as a surrogate for enteric viruses by dissolved ionic copper in water. Reduction of MS2 increased with increasing doses of copper. At 0.3 mg/L, there was a 1.8-log(10) reduction of MS2 within 6 h. At 1 and 3 mg/L, 2-2.5 log(10) inactivation could be achieved between 6 and 24 h. Parameters for the Chick-Watson, Hom, and One Hit-Two Population models of inactivation were calculated and evaluated, all of which demonstrated strong goodness-of-fit and predictability at various contact times. Copper inactivates MS2 under controlled conditions at doses between 0.3 and 3 mg/L. Although requiring longer contact times than conventional disinfectants, it is a candidate for improving the safety of stored drinking water.", "label": 0}

Violet seedlings propagated through tissue culture (direct regeneration) had significantly higher salicylic acid (SA) concns. from seed and rootstock propagated plants. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) studies prior to the salt treatments revealed that genetic similarity at the mol. level among seed, root stock and direct regenerated violet seedlings was 50.9 to 70.5%. NaCl applications (50 mol m-3) reduced plant and root lengths, plant fresh and dry wts. in plants obtained through seeds and rootstock as compared to direct regenerated seedlings. Direct regenerated violet showed better plant growth significantly both in saline and non-saline conditions. Seedlings raised through direct regeneration strongly inhibited accumulation of Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Cl- and org. solute accumulations as glycine betaine (GB) and root total sol. carbohydrates (TSC) but stimulated N and relative water contents (RWC). Direct regenerated seedlings showed an enhanced catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and guaiacol dependent peroxidase (GDP) activities as compared to seed and root stock propagated plants. It was concluded that direct regenerated plants had better performance under salt stress in relation to growth and ion accumulations as compared to seed and root stock propagated violet seedlings. This might be due to higher SA concns. in direct regenerated seedlings which resulted from somaclonal variations or growth media applied during tissue culture technique.

In the orchard, apples may be contaminated with spores which can potentially grow in the resulting juice and cause spoilage. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of gaseous chlorine dioxide against A. acidoterrestris spores on apple surfaces. A. acidoterrestris spores were inoculated onto apple surfaces and were placed at room temperature, in a tightly sealed chamber containing a chlorine dioxide generating sachet, low, medium, or high release, for 30 min, 1, 2, and 3 h. After exposure, surviving spores were enumerated on K agar. Chlorine dioxide treated apples were stored at 4 \u00b0C for 7 days to assess the effect on visual quality. Inoculated, untreated apples served as the visual quality control. After exposure to high and medium release sachets for 1 h, spores were reduced to an undetectable level, a 5 log10 reduction; however, visual quality was compromised. After 1, 2, and 3 h of exposure to low release sachets, spore reductions were 2.7, 3.7, and 4.5 log10, respectively. And, after 7 days of storage, there were no significant visual quality differences between the apples exposed to low release sachet for all treatment times when compared to the control. Gaseous chlorine dioxide can effectively reduce viable A. acidoterrestris spores on apple surfaces. Due to the efficacy and easy of use, chlorine dioxide gas sachets may be useful to maintain apple quality during storage and shipping.", "label": 0}

The study modelled a 50-m \u00d7 20-m swimming pool using both a small-scale physical model and computational fluid dynamics to investigate how water and pathogens move around a pool in order to identify potential risk spots. Our study revealed a number of lessons for pool operators, designers and policy-makers: disinfection reaches the majority of a full-scale pool in approximately 16 minutes operating at the maximum permissible inlet velocity of 0.5 m/s. This suggests that where a pool is designed to have 15 paired inlets it is capable of distributing disinfectant throughout the water body within an acceptable time frame. However, the study also showed that the exchange rate of water is not uniform across the pool tank and that there is potential for areas of the pool tank to retain contaminated water for significant periods of time. 'Dead spots' exist at either end of the pool where pathogens could remain. This is particularly significant if there is a faecal release into the pool by bathers infected with Cryptosporidium parvum, increasing the potential for waterborne disease transmission.", "label": 0}

We examined the disinfective potential of electrolysis and mechanism of disinfection, and clarified the disinfective effect of electrolysis on tap water contaminated with bacteria, and discussed its clinical applications. Tap waters artificially contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Legionella pneumophila, and Staphylococcus aureus could be sterilized by electrolysis at 20-30 mA for 5 min. A high-density suspension (10(6) CFU/ml) of a spore forming bacterium, Bacillus subtilis was not completely sterilized by electrolysis at 50 mA up to 30 min, but a low-density suspension (10(5) CFU/ml) was totally sterilized by electrolysis at 50 mA for 5 min. Electrolyzed P. aeruginosa changed morphologically, that is, there was bleb formation on the cell wall and irregular aggregation of cytoplasmic small granules. Moreover, cytoplasmic enzyme, nitrate reductase, was inactivated by the electrolysis. On the other hand, genomic DNA of the electrolyzed bacteria was not degenerated, therefore, their DNA polymerase activity was not completely inactivated. Consequently, the major agent in electrolysis for bactericidal action was considered to be free chlorine, and the possible bactericidal mechanism was by destruction of bacterial membranes, followed by the aggregation of peripheral cytoplasmic proteins. Electrolysis of tap water for both disinfecting contaminating bacteria and increasing the disinfectant capacity was considered effective with some limitations, particularly against high-density contamination by spore-forming bacteria. In clinical settings, electrolysis of tap water is considered effective to disinfect water for hand washing in operation theatres, and bathing water for immunocompromised hosts.", "label": 1}

Concns. of 106 bacteria per mL are commonly obsd. in drainage water of plant cultures. To avoid potential risks for plant health, the disinfection of irrigation water is an alternative. Indeed, techniques like the thermodisinfection were shown to be effective but request substantial investments. The characteristics of the floricultural farms of the south of France (size, capacity of investment...) directed our lab. towards the search for a methodol. effective but less expensive. Analogous to drinking water disinfection, experimentation using chlorine was performed. Feasibility studies were carried out in the lab. to evaluate the sensitivity of Agrobacterium tumefaciens that is likely to be disseminated in recycled water. These studies demonstrated that an amt. of 4 mg/l of active chlorine applied over 30 min was necessary and sufficient to obtain disinfection of bacteria. After these tests, active chlorine disinfection was applied to rose cultures in order to test chlorine phytotoxicity and to observe chlorides concn. No significant differences in the prodn. yields were found and systems using chlorine gas were set up in rose farms. No plant health problem was detected after 3 yr of operation.

{"id": "2650", "title": "Serial disinfection with heat and chlorine to reduce microorganism populations on poultry transport containers", "abstract": "A prototype system for the cleaning and decontamination of poultry transport containers was previously developed and evaluated as a means of eliminating foodborne pathogens entering poultry processing plants. While decontamination of the containers once with the use of either hot water (up to 70 degrees C) or sodium hypochlorite (up to 1,000 ppm) resulted in significant reductions in the numbers of coliforms and the elimination of small numbers of Salmonella, complete removal of pathogens was not attained. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine whether repeated decontamination of the same containers could eliminate coliforms and Salmonella consistently. Individual five-tier containers consisting of galvanized steel frames and fiberglass floors were identified (n = 6) and decontaminated once per day for five consecutive days after being used to haul broilers from farms to the processing plant. Two types of containers were tested in this study: one had previously been used for broiler transportation, and the other had new floors. After each transport, the containers were first precleaned with a cleaning agent using a high-pressure jet (6,094 kPa) to remove debris and to loosen biofilms from surfaces. The containers were then immersed in an aqueous solution of 1,000 ppm of sodium hypochlorite at 70 degrees C for 2 min. Samples obtained from the container surfaces before and after each cleaning and decontamination were analyzed to obtain coliform and Salmonella counts. Coliforms were completely eliminated from both types of containers following one decontamination treatment. Because no Salmonella were detected on the containers, the effect of decontamination in the elimination of Salmonella was not determined. Similar treatments on five successive days also resulted in poultry transport containers that were essentially free of Salmonella and coliforms. This decontamination system involving a combination of heat and sodium hypochlorite can be used as a standard method for cleaning poultry transport containers in the poultry industry. It is recommended that such containers be cleaned after each use to avoid the potential risk of a buildup of significantly higher loads of pathogenic microorganisms and their biofilms.", "label": 1}

Thienodolin produced by Streptomyces albogriseolus contains a chlorine atom in the 6-position of the indole ring system and is believed to be derived from tryptophan. Using the gene of the tryptophan 7-halogenase (PrnA) from the pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic gene cluster the gene for a tryptophan 6-halogenase was cloned, sequenced and heterologously overexpressed in Pseudomonas strains. In vitro activity of the purified enzyme could only be shown in a two-component enzyme system consisting of the halogenase, a flavin reductase, NADH, FAD and halide ions. The enzyme catalyses the regioselective chlorination and bromination of l- and d-tryptophan. In its native form the enzyme is probably a homodimer with a relative molecular mass of the subunits of 63 600 (including the His-tag).

Two filters were compared for analysis of 11 stream water samples collected throughout the United States. Replicate 10-L stream water samples (unspiked and spiked with 100-250 oocysts) were tested to evaluate matrix effects. Oocyst recoveries from the stream water samples averaged 22% (standard deviation [SD] = +/-17%)with a membrane disk and 12% (SD = +/-6%) with a capsule filter. Oocyst recoveries from reagent water precision and recovery samples averaged 39% (SD = +/-13%) with a membrane disk and 47% (SD = +/-19%) with a capsule filter. These results demonstrate that Cryptosporidium oocysts can be recovered from stream waters using method 1622, but recoveries are lower than those from reagent-grade water. This research also evaluated concentrations of indicator bacteria in the stream water samples. Because few samples were oocyst-positive, relationships between detections of oocysts and concentrations of indicator organisms could not be determined.", "label": 0}

Freshly cut lettuce releases significant amounts of organic matter that negatively impacts the effectiveness of chlorine or other sanitizers for microbial reduction. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether a sanitizer wash before cutting improves microbial reduction efficacy compared to a traditional postcutting sanitizer wash. Romaine lettuce leaves were quantitatively inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 strains and washed in chlorinated water before or after cutting, and E. coli O157:H7 cells that survived the washing process were enumerated to determine the effectiveness of microbial reduction for the 2 cutting and washing sequences. Whole-leaf washing in chlorinated water improved pathogen reduction by approximately 1 log unit over traditional cut-leaf sanitization. Similar improvement in the reduction of background microflora was also observed. Inoculated \"Lollo Rossa\" red lettuce leaves were mixed with noninoculated Green-Leaf lettuce leaves to evaluate pathogen cross-contamination during processing. High level (96.7% subsamples, average MPN 0.6 log CFU/g) of cross-contamination of noninoculated green leaves by inoculated red leaves was observed when mixed lettuce leaves were cut prior to washing in chlorinated water. In contrast, cross-contamination of noninoculated green leaves was significantly reduced (3.3% of subsamples, average MPN <or=-0.3 log CFU/g) when the mixed leaves were washed in chlorinated water before cutting. This result suggests that whole-leaf sanitizing washes could be a practical strategy for enhancing the efficacy of chlorine washes for pathogen reduction and cross-contamination prevention.", "label": 1}

Our investigations included bacteriological examination focused on general contamination and indicator bacteria (bacteria cultivated at 22 and 37 degrees C, total coliforms, E. coli, enterococci), physico-chemical examination (pH, ammonium ions, nitrites, nitrates, chlorides, free chlorine, chemical oxygen demand CODMn and Ca + Mg), and EEM (excitation emission matrix) fluorescence spectroscopy which focused on the presence of natural organic matter (NOM). After determining the optimum single dose of Chloramine T for disinfection of water used for watering of animals, the bacteriological quality of water was checked on the 5th day after the disinfection. The results showed that water quality was better on Farm No. 3 than on Farms No. 1 and No. 2. The weather (precipitation) evidently affected the quality of water on all three farms and was associated with some risk to animals consuming this water. The experimentally determined doses of Chloramine T appeared relatively efficient on Farm No. 1 and Farm No. 3, while the Chloramine T dose estimated for adequate disinfection on Farm No. 2 had to be increased considerably but was still much lower than the dose recommended by the manufacturer of this preparation.

Since its emergence in 1984 as an agent of fatal hemorrhagic diseases in rabbits, RHDV has killed millions of rabbits and has been dispersed to all of the inhabitable continents. In view of their successful and apparently increasing emergence, the development of antiviral strategies to control infections due to these viral pathogens has now become an important issue in medicine and veterinary medicine. Antiviral strategies have to be based on an understanding of the epidemiology, transmission, clinical symptoms, viral replication and immunity to infection resulting from infection by these viruses. Here, we provide an overview of the mechanisms underlying calicivirus infection, focusing on the molecular aspects of replication in the host cell.

{"id": "4077", "title": "Ozonation of drinking water: part II. Disinfection and by-product formation in presence of bromide, iodide or chlorine", "abstract": "Ozone is an excellent disinfectant and can even be used to inactivate microorganisms such as protozoa which are very resistant to conventional disinfectants. Proper rate constants for the inactivation of microorganisms are only available for six species (E. coli, Bacillus subtilis spores, Rotavirus, Giardia lamblia cysts, Giardia muris cysts, Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts). The apparent activation energy for the inactivation of bacteria is in the same order as most chemical reactions (35-50 kJ mol(-1)), whereas it is much higher for the inactivation of protozoa (80 kJ mol(-1)). This requires significantly higher ozone exposures at low temperatures to get a similar inactivation for protozoa. Even for the inactivation of resistant microorganisms, OH radicals only play a minor role. Numerous organic and inorganic ozonation disinfection/oxidation by-products have been identified. The by-product of main concern is bromate, which is formed in bromide-containing waters. A low drinking water standard of 10 microg l(-1) has been set for bromate. Therefore, disinfection and oxidation processes have to be evaluated to fulfil these criteria. In certain cases, when bromide concentrations are above about 50 microg l(-1), it may be necessary to use control measures to lower bromate formation (lowering of pH, ammonia addition). Iodate is the main by-product formed during ozonation of iodide-containing waters. The reactions involved are direct ozone oxidations. Iodate is considered non-problematic because it is transformed back to iodide endogenically. Chloride cannot be oxidized during ozonation processes under drinking water conditions. Chlorate is only formed if a preoxidation by chlorine and/or chlorine dioxide has occurred.", "label": 0}
{"id": "6222", "title": "Formation of microbial biofilm in hygienic situations: a problem of control", "abstract": "The formation of microbial biofilm presents a challenge to the establishment and maintenance of hygienic conditions in public health, the home and in industry. The use of biocides is central to the hygienic control of microbial growth. Such agents, optimised for their activity against suspended populations of cells, are spectacular in their failure to control adherent biofilm communities. To date there have been limited developments to remedy the situation. Recalcitrance of biofilm communities to anti-microbial treatments has been attributed to organisation of cells within an exopolymeric matrix. This, together with the close proximity of cells, causes reaction\u2013diffusion limitation of the access of agent from its point of application to the deeper lying cells. These cells out-survive those on the surface of the biofilm and, if the bulk of the treatment agent is depleted or the exposure transient, will multiply and divide rapidly. Nutrients also will become depleted within the core of the developing community. This leads to the establishment of spatial gradients of growth rate and redox within the community structure. Different growth-limiting nutrients will also prevail at different points in the biofilm. These conditions provide for a plethora of phenotypes within the biofilm, each reflecting the physico-chemical micro-environment of individual cells and their proximity to neighbours. Faster-growing, more susceptible cells will generally lie on the periphery of the biofilm with slow-growing recalcitrant ones being more deeply placed. The more resistant phenotypes will survive the remainder. In both instances, at the fringes of action, selection pressures will enrich the populations with the least susceptible genotype or phenotype. Repeated chronic exposure to sub-lethal treatments might then select for a resistant population that share this resistance with third party agents. Whilst neither mechanism can provide a complete explanation of recalcitrance, together they will delay eradication of the treated population and allow other selection and regulation events to occur.", "label": 0}
{"id": "3864", "title": "Hospital effluents as a source of emerging pollutants: An overview of micropollutants and sustainable treatment options", "abstract": "Summary Hospital wastewaters contain a variety of toxic or persistent substances such as pharmaceuticals, radionuclides, solvents and disinfectants for medical purposes in a wide range of concentrations due to laboratory and research activities or medicine excretion. Most of these compounds belong to the so called emerging contaminants; quite often unregulated pollutants which may be candidates for future regulation depending on research on their potential health effects and monitoring of their occurrence. Their main characteristic is that they do not need to persist in the environment to cause negative effects since their high transformation/removal rates can be compensated for by their continuous introduction into the environment. Some of these compounds, most of them pharmaceuticals and personal care products may also be present in urban wastewaters. Their concentrations in the effluents may vary from ng L?1 to ?g L?1. In this paper, hospital effluents and urban wastewaters are compared in terms of quali\u2013quantitative characteristics. On the basis of an in-depth survey: (i) hospital average specific daily water consumptions (L patient?1 day?1) are evaluated and compared to urban ones (L person?1 day?1), (ii) conventional parameters concentrations in hospital effluents are compared to urban ones and (iii) main pharmaceuticals and other emerging compounds contents are compared in the two wastewaters.

{"id": "4460", "title": "Persistence of viral genomes after autoclaving", "abstract": "The ability of autoclaving to degrade viral genomes was investigated by real-time PCR and real-time reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR. Several factors were considered: the nucleic acid composition of the virus (DNA or RNA), hydration state of the sample, and the duration of autoclaving. Viral genomes were damaged more easily under hydrated conditions compared to dry conditions. The genomes of RNA viruses, such as MS2 and norovirus degraded more readily than DNA virus (adenovirus). MS2 genome was the most vulnerable among those tested, with no amplification observed after 18 min of autoclaving. Adenovirus genomes, on the other hand, were detected after autoclaving for 36 min under hydrated or dry conditions. For norovirus, 18 min of autoclaving under hydrated condition or 36 min under dry conditions was enough to destroy noroviral genomes. For noroviral samples, 1.1% of noroviral gene segments were remained after autoclaving for 18 min under dry conditions; however, when a two-step approach was used for the RT-PCR reaction with priming at the poly-A tail about 2552 bp from the qPCR amplification site, the gene segment was not amplified after autoclaving for 18 min. Thus, norovirus amplification observed after 18 min of autoclaving in the dry sample is likely from less than full length genomic segments of norovirus RNA remaining in the sample.", "label": 0}

Methods The oysters were allocated in sites with different degrees of contamination and analyzed after 14 days. Some animals were used as positive controls by artificial bioaccumulation with HAdV2 and MNV1 and subjected to depuration assays using UV lamps (18 or 36 W) for 168 h. The following pollutants were researched in the naturally contaminated oysters, oysters after 14 days in sites and oysters during the depuration processes: virus (HAdV, HAV, HuNoV GI/GII and JCPyV), by (RT) qPCR; protozoa (Cryptosporidium and Giardia species), by immunomagnetic separation and immunofluorescence; and organic compounds (AHs, PAHs, LABs, PCBs and organochlorine pesticides\u2014OCs), by chromatography. Changes in the oysters' tissues produced by the depuration processes were also evaluated using histochemical analysis by light microscopy. In the artificially bioaccumulated oysters, only HAdV2 and MNV1 were investigated by (RT) qPCR before the depuration procedures and after 96 and 168 h of these procedures. Results At 14 days post-allocation, HAdV was found in all the sites (6.2 \u00d7 105 to 4.4 \u00d7 107 GC g? 1), and Giardia species in only one site. Levels of PCBs and OCs in the oyster's tissues were below the detection limit for all samples. AHs (3.5 to 4.4 ?g g? 1), PAHs (11 to 191 ng g? 1) and LABs (57 to 751 ng g? 1) were detected in the samples from 3 sites. During the depuration assays, we found HAdV, Giardia and Cryptosporidium species until 168 h, independent of UV treatment. AHs, PAHs and LABs were found also after 168 h of depuration (36 W and without UV lamp). The depuration procedures did not produce changes in the oysters' tissues. In the artificially contaminated and depurated oysters, we detected HAdV until 168 h and MNV1 until 96 h of depuration. Conclusion The applied depuration treatments were unable to eliminate the protozoa or to degrade the HAdV genomes but were able to degrade the MNV1 genomes. Similarly, the UV water treatment was not efficient for aliphatic hydrocarbons, PAHs and LABs, as their concentrations were equivalent or higher to the concentrations of the control samples and samples from depuration tanks without UV treatment.", "label": 0}

Melons were submerged for 2 min into either water control or water containing quaternary ammonium chloride (300 ppm) or an 18% hydrogen peroxide and 12% peroxyacetic acid combination (100 ppm), or an acetic acid, peroxyacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide combination (0.78%). Microbial analysis and instrumental measurements were utilized to assess the melons on day 0, 7, 14 and 21 in three separate trials. The experimental results indicated no reduction of fungal contaminants and no changes in firmness or color of melons following the applied treatments over the time of the study (P>0.05). Additionally, the results provided evidence of extension of shelf life due to application of the tested washing solutions onto the watermelons or cantaloupe. Practical ApplicationsConcerns over microbial safety in the melon industry prompted the use of intervention treatments to reduce foodborne pathogens. New formulations of antimicrobial treatments have created a wide variety of washing treatments that the melons producers can utilize in their production system. Research has shown that many of these formulations have antimicrobial effects, but little data have shown whether quality affects will result. This fact has caused growers' to hesitate using such products. The results of this work indicate that the chosen produce sanitizers did not reduce the quality of whole melons following washing treatments. Information provided by this work will be utilized to communicate benefits of surface washing in the melon industry, and to promote sanitation and safe handling practices through extension education.", "label": 0}

This paper presents findings on the effectiveness of UV radiation, peracetic acid (PAA), chlorine dioxide (ClO2), and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) as disinfectants for advanced primary treatment (APT) plant effluent. Wastewater samples for bench-scale testing were collected from an agua negra (\"black water\") ditch that is part of the combined sewer system in Ciudad Juarez. Bench-scale simulations of the APT process used in Ciudad Juarez were run using a jar test apparatus and aluminum sulfate [Al2(SO4)3] as the coagulant. Jar test effluent from the bench system was used for disinfection testing. The Mexican discharge quality standard for total coliforms is 10 000/100 mL. Ultraviolet radiation met this standard at a dose of 47.5 mW-s/cm2. Ultraviolet disinfection proved reliable and effective despite the presence of suspended solids, and UV dose effectiveness expressed as a total coliforms survival ratio was best explained by a linear regression model. The ClO2 dose ranged from 10 to 20 mg/L and was only effective under ambient temperature conditions found during the winter months; PAA disinfection never met Mexican standards. Chlorine disinfection was effective at a dose range of 8 to 10 mg/L on samples collected at low temperature conditions.

The motivation for this study was to determine whether UV disinfection followed by chlorine or monochloramine for a very short contact time (e.g., a minute) could satisfy regulatory requirements for four-log virus inactivation. In order to overcome the difficulty Ad 41 presents for enumeration of the virus in cell culture, a technique was used that combined immunofluorescent staining of viral antigen with traditional scoring of cytopathic effect. A UV dose of 40 mJ/cm(2) (millijoules per square centimeter) (applied using a collimated beam apparatus) achieved approximately one-log inactivation of adenovirus types 2, 5 and 41, confirming previous research. Ad 41 was found to be more UV resistant to UV light than Ad 2 or Ad 5 at UV doses > 70 mJ/cm(2) to a statistically significant degree (95% confidence); however, at lower UV doses there were no statistically significant differences. Experiments with Ad 5 and Ad 41 at 5 degrees C and pH 8.5 showed that chlorine was very effective against Ad 5 and Ad 41, with a product of disinfectant concentration and contact time (CT) of 0.22 mg min/L providing four-log inactivation.

However, the relative importance of osmotic and specific ion effect on plant growth seems to vary depending on the salt tolerance of the plant under study. Tall wheatgrass (TW), perennial ryegrass (PR), African millet (AM) and Rhodesgrass (Rh) were grown in nutrient solution with sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), potassium chloride (KCl), and potassium sulfate (K2SO4) salinity up to electrical conductivity (EC) 27 dS m-1. Growth of all plant species decreased significantly at high level (EC 27 dS m-1) of NaCl and Na2SO4 salts. However, the growth of none of the plant species was affected significantly by KCl and K2SO4 at any level. Even leaf and shoot fresh weights were enhanced by K2SO4 in all plant species, except AM. Chlorine (Cl) was taken up in similar quantities from KCl and NaCl solutions and the content of the respective cations was similar to each other. Further sensitivity to sulfate and chloride was equal when sodium concentrations in shoots were equal, regardless of the anion composition of the media. The sodium (Na) concentration of the leaves of the plant species increased with increased NaCl and Na2SO4 levels in the nutrient solutions. The leaf Na concentration of TW was lower than that of the other plant species. However, the root Na concentration of TW was higher than that of the other plant species. Increased NaCl and Na2SO4 concentrations had a marked effect on leaf water potential of all plant species, and the TW showed higher leaf water potential at all levels of salts. Tall wheatgrass adjusted osmotically by accumulating electrolytes from the nutrient solution and by accumulation of glycinebetaine.

Food processing technologies are action or method that is used to maintain foods at certain desirable properties. The traditional processing method is thermal technology which refers to the application of heat energy. Thermal processing is an effective way of preserving food because the great majority of harmful pathogens are killed at temperatures close to the boiling point of water. However, consumer demand for more natural fresh-like food and raised economic standards have triggered the development of emerging technologies to replace traditional well-established thermal processing. In recent years, many new sophisticated nonthermal preservation techniques have developed for fruits, vegetables, milk and eggs to extend the quality and shelf-life, minimize risk, protect the environment, and improve functional, sensory, and nutritional properties. Many of emerging preservation technologies have already reached commercial adoption in specific applications while many others remain promising. Development of suitable equipment, especially for continuous processing and standardization of the process parameters for easy regulatory approval will pave the way for improved emerging technologies.", "label": 1}

The results from the laboratory- and pilot-scale testings showed that efficient removal of the vast majority of APIs could be achieved by a membrane bioreactor (MBR) followed by ozone, ozone + hydrogen peroxide or powdered activated carbon (PAC). Chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) was significantly less effective. MBR + PAC (450 mg/l) was the most efficient technology, while the most cost-efficient technology was MBR + ozone (156 mg O(3)/l applied over 20 min). With MBR an efficient removal of Escherichia coli and enterococci was measured, and no antibiotic resistant bacteria were detected in the effluent. With MBR + ozone and MBR + PAC also the measured effluent concentrations of APIs (e.g. ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethizole) were below available predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) for the marine environment without dilution. Iodinated contrast media were also reduced significantly (80-99% for iohexol, iopromide and ioversol and 40-99% for amidotrizoateacid). A full-scale MBR treatment plant with ozone at a hospital with 900 beds is estimated to require an investment cost of euro1.6 mill. and an operating cost of euro1/m(3) of treated water.", "label": 0}

The survival of STEC cells was determined at different treatment intervals. Populations of 19B cells were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of 19D cells at all sampling intervals for the chlorine treatments, at 24- to 48-h intervals for the 1 M NaCl treatment, and at 9- to 48-h intervals for the 2 M NaCl treatment. Significant differences in populations of 49B and 49D cells were observed after 9, 36, and 48 h of treatment with 2 M NaCl and after 3, 12, 36, and 48 h of treatment with 3 M NaCl (P < 0.05). Populations of 49B cells were higher than those of 49D cells (P < 0.05) also after 5 to 10 min of treatment with 50 mug/ml sodium hypochlorite and 3 to 10 min of treatment with 100 mug/ml sodium hypochlorite.

In this context the water plays an important role in the quality of minimally processed vegetables. We assessed the hygienic-sanitary quality of leafy vegetables and obtained data of interest to health surveillance agencies and public health. They were tested for the presence of total and faecal coliforms, and also parasitic protozoa and helminths. The vegetable samples were purchased in supermarkets of the Midwest of the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. We performed bacteriological analyses of wash water samples using chromogenic substrates to obtain the most probable number of the coliform group at 35 \u00b0C and Escherichia coli. We used Hoffman\u2019s spontaneous sedimentation technique for the parasitological analysis in order to check the occurrence of heavy and light helminths eggs and protozoan cysts. The analyses indicated the presence of coliforms, nematodes and freeliving protozoa, except for the last wash. We concluded that the washing process using running water and no active chlorine was not efficient in reducing the load of microorganisms in the vegetables. Therefore, intensive educational programmes should be implemented by health authorities to encourage hygienic-sanitary practices and risk reduction of food-borne diseases.", "label": 1}

(0, 50, 85, 120, 155 mM NaCl) under in vitro and growth chamber conditions (explant mortality, in vitro stem elongation, bud no., and rooting ability). Varieties were divided into sensitive, moderately tolerant, and tolerant. Increasing salt concns. decreased the hydration of aerial parts and roots, the decrease being smaller in tolerant varieties. Increasing concns. reduced K and, to a smaller extent, P and Ca content. With and without salt treatment K and P levels were lower in sensitive plants. Na and Cl accumulated to a higher extent in tolerant plants. The authors suggest that tolerance of in vitro grown rootstocks was due to their capacity to accumulate salt, to increase K concn. in the tissue and to maintain a high H2O content.

During this epoch, Portuguese gardens, such as the one surrounding the Fishing House, were commonly ornamented with glazed wall tile claddings. Currently, some of these outdoor tile panels are covered with dark colored biofilms, contributing to undesirable aesthetic changes and eventually inducing chem. and phys. damage to the tile surfaces. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the investigated biofilms are mainly composed of green algae, cyanobacteria and dematiaceous fungi. With the aim of mitigating biodeterioration, four different biocides (TiO2 nanoparticles, Biotin T, Preventol RI 80 and Albilex Biostat) were applied in situ to the glazed wall tiles. Their efficacy was monitored by visual examn., epifluorescence microscopy and DNA-based anal. Significant changes in the microbial community compn. were obsd. 4 mo after treatment with Preventol RI 80 and Biotin T. Although the original community was inactivated after these treatments, an early stage of re-colonization was detected 6 mo after the biocide application. TiO2 nanoparticles showed promising results due to their self-cleaning effect, causing the detachment of the biofilm from the tile surface, which remained clean 6 and even 24 mo after biocide application.

When administered as four-dose course, by repeating a single dose (52.4 mg kg-1) every three days, UNICAM-1 significantly reduces the growth of A17 triple negative breast cancer cells transplanted into FVB syngeneic mice. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that UNICAM-1 is rapidly eliminated from kidney, liver and bloodstream thanks to its high hydrosolubility, exerting excellent therapeutic activity with minimal side effects. Immunohistological analysis revealed that the efficacy of UNICAM-1, mainly relies on its capacity to reverse tumor-associated immune suppression by significantly reducing the number of tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells.

METHODS: Inactivation experiments of one strain Mycobacteria mucogenicum, isolated from a drinking water distribution system in South China were conducted with various chlorine disinfectants. Inactivation efficiency and disinfectant residual, as well as the formation of organic chloramines, were measured during the experiments. RESULTS: This strain of M. mucogenicum showed high resistance to chlorine. The CT values of 99.9% inactivation by free chlorine, monochloramine and chlorine dioxide were detected as 29.6 +/- 1.46, 170 +/- 6.16, and 10.9 +/-1.55 min. (mg/L) respectively, indicating that chlorine dioxide exhibited significantly higher efficiency than free chlorine and monochloramine. It was also found that M. mucogenicum reacted with chlorine disinfectants more slowly than 5. aureus, but consumed more chlorine disinfectants during longer time of contact. Lipid analysis of the cell construction revealed that 95.7% of cell membrane lipid of M. mucogenicum was composed of saturated long chain fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids were regarded as more stable and more hydrophilic which enabled the cell membrane to prevent the diffusion of chlorine. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that different compositions of cell membrane might endow M. mucogenicum with a higher chlorine resistance.", "label": 1}

This study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of EO water and two different forms of chlorinated water (chlorine water from Cl2 and Ca(OCl)2 as sources of chlorine) in inactivating Salmonella on alfalfa seeds and sprouts. Tengram sets of alfalfa seeds inoculated with a five-strain cocktail of Salmonella (6.3 x 10(4) CFU/g) were subjected to 90 ml of deionized water (control), EO water (84 mg/liter of active chlorine), chlorine water (84 mg/liter of active chlorine), and Ca(OCl)2 solutions at 90 and 20,000 mg/liter of active chlorine for 10 min at 24 +/- 2 degrees C. The application of EO water, chlorinated water, and 90 mg/liter of Ca(OCl)2 to alfalfa seeds for 10 min reduced initial populations of Salmonella by at least 1.5 log10 CFU/g. For seed sprouting, alfalfa seeds were soaked in the different treatment solutions described above for 3 h. Ca(OCl)2 (20,000 mg/liter of active chlorine) was the most effective treatment in reducing the populations of Salmonella and non-Salmonella microflora (4.6 and 7.0 log10 CFU/g, respectively). However, the use of high concentrations of chlorine generates worker safety concerns. Also, the Ca(OCl)2 treatment significantly reduced seed germination rates (70% versus 90 to 96%). For alfalfa sprouts, higher bacterial populations were recovered from treated sprouts containing seed coats than from sprouts with seed coats removed. The effectiveness of EO water improved when soaking treatments were applied to sprouts in conjunction with sonication and seed coat removal. The combined treatment achieved 2.3- and 1.5-log10 CFU/g greater reductions than EO water alone in populations of Salmonella and non-Salmonella microflora, respectively.

Each culture tube was divided horizontally into a surface (0-150 mm) compartment and a subsurface (150-250 mm) compartment sepd. by a root-permeable paraffin wax barrier. Thus, P supplied to surface roots could not percolate or diffuse into the soil in the subsurface compartment. The soil in the subsurface compartment was divided into rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere zones using a porous (5 ?m) membrane. Root growth of both cultivars into the subsurface zone was enhanced by increased P supply to surface roots, but did not conform to known relationships between root growth and soil pH, extractable-Al, or pH, Al or P concns. in soil soln. Concns. of Al in soil soln. in the rhizosphere were greater than those in soln. in the bulk soil. Concns. of Al reactive with pyrocatechol violet (30 s - RRAl) in the rhizosphere soil soln. were generally greater than those in nonrhizosphere soil. With the Al-sensitive cultivar, root dry wt. and length increased as concns. of RRAl in the rhizosphere soil soln. increased. Increased concns. of Al in rhizosphere soil solns. were not related to the presence of org. ligands in soln. The effect of P in promoting root penetration into the acidic subsurface stratum was not related to differential attainment of maturity by the plant shoots, but appeared to be related to the effect of P in enhancing the rate of root growth. Thus, suboptimal supply of P to the surface roots of a plant, even at levels sufficient to preclude development of nutritional (P) stress symptoms, may seriously reduce tolerance to Al, and hence diminish the ability of roots to penetrate into acidic subsoils.

It is not clear to what extent the ontogenetic development of calves or the feeding strategy [e.g., prolonged milk replacer (MR) feeding] contribute to this pathol. The objective of this study was therefore to analyze effects of MR feeding, weaning, and supplementation of short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) on the development of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in calves during the first 3 mo of life. Thirty male Holstein-Friesian calves (18 \u00b1 0.7 d of age) were assigned to 1 of 3 dietary treatments: the control (CON) group received MR only, the FOS group received MR with the addn. of short-chain FOS, and the solid feed (SF) group was progressively weaned to SF. The CON and FOS calves received an amt. of MR, which gradually increased (from 400 to 1,400 g/d) during the 71-d trial period. For the SF calves, the amt. of MR increased from 400 to 850 g/d at d 30, and then gradually decreased, until completely weaned to only SF at d 63. The change in whole body insulin sensitivity was assessed by i.v. glucose tolerance tests. Milk tolerance tests were performed twice to assess changes in postprandial blood glucose, insulin, and nonesterified fatty acid responses. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was high at the start (16.7 \u00b1 1.6 \u00d7 10-4 [?U/mL]-1), but decreased with age to 4.2 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 10-4 [?U/mL]-1 at the end of the trial. The decrease in insulin sensitivity was most pronounced (?70%) between d 8 and 29 of the trial. Dietary treatments did not affect the decrease in insulin sensitivity. For CON and FOS calves, the postprandial insulin response was 3-fold higher at the end of the trial than at the start, whereas the glucose response remained similar. The SF calves, however, showed pronounced hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia at the end of the trial, although weaning did not affect insulin sensitivity. We conclude that whole body insulin sensitivity decreases by 75% in calves during the first 3 mo of life. Weaning or supplementation of short-chain FOS does not affect this age-related decline in insulin sensitivity. Glucose homeostasis is not affected by supplementation of short-chain FOS in young calves, whereas postprandial responses of glucose and insulin to a MR meal strongly increase after weaning.

This was done aseptically to prevent contamination during the operation of the MBRs. The objective was to determine whether the degradation of 2-CBA by cometabolism, using acetate as a primary carbon source, under hypoxic conditions might be enhanced for vgb-bearing cells in MBRs. The 2-CBA removal efficiency of transformed B. cepacia (97-99%) was slightly higher than that of untransformed B. cepacia (95-99%) at all stages. The average amount of chloride released from 2-CBA by transformed cells was also higher than for untransformed cells, 92-96% compared to 64-84% of the maximum theoretical amount, the exact value depending on the operating conditions. These results indicate that 2-CBA degradation/transformation is not accompanied by the stoichiometric release of chloride for the untransformed strain. The difference between percentages of 2-CBA removal and chloride release by untransformed cells was attributed to persistence, under hypoxic conditions, of the 2-CBA chlorine atom in 2-CBA metabolites. Growth of transformed cells was also significantly enhanced under hypoxic conditions compared to untransformed cells. For varying media compositions, the transformed cells reached higher cell densities (3.2-5.4 g/L) relative to untransformed cells (2.8-4.7 g/L) at food to microorganism ratios ranging from 0.44-0.59 to 0.38-0.49 g COD/g biomass-d The observed yields thus ranged from 0.16-0.20 and 0.15-0.18g TSS/g COD for untransformed and transformed cells, respectively.

The disinfectants tested were; a chlorine releasing agent, sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) at 1000 ppm and 10,000 ppm av Cl; chlorine dioxide at 1100 ppm av ClO2 (Tristel, MediChem International Limited); 70% industrial methylated spirits (IMS); 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde (Asep, Galan); 10% succinedialdehyde and formaldehyde mixture (Gigasept, Schulke & Mayr); 0.35% peracetic acid (NuCidex, Johnson & Johnson); and a peroxygen compound at 1% and 3% (Virkon, Antec International). Results showed that the clinical isolate of MAI was much more resistant than M. tuberculosis to all the disinfectants, while the type strains of M. chelonae and M. fortuitum were far more sensitive. The washer disinfector isolate of M. chelonae was extremely resistant to 2% alkaline activated glutaraldehyde and appeared to be slightly more resistant than the type strain to Nu-Cidex, Gigasept, Virkon and the lower concentration of NaDCC. This study has shown peracetic acid (Nu-Cidex), chlorine dioxide (Tristel), alcohol (IMS) and high concentrations of a chlorine releasing agent (NaDCC) are rapidly mycobactericidal. Glutaraldehyde, although effective, is a slow mycobactericide. Gigasept and Virkon are poor mycobactericidal agents and are not therefore recommended for instruments or spillage if mycobacteria are likely to be present.", "label": 0}

Chlorine-based sanitizers widely used on produce have limited efficacy and pose health risks. This study determined efficacy of combined low-frequency ultrasound with zinc oxide (ZnO) in inactivating Listeria innocua. similar to 6 log(CFU/mL) L. innocua were treated with either 20 or 40 mM ZnO and sonication (20 kHz, 43-45 W, 120 mu m amplitude) at room temperature for 0-30 min. 40 mM ZnO and ultrasound resulted in > 5 log CFU/mL L. innocua reduction within 8 min, while individual treatments caused < 1 log CFU/mL reduction. The inactivation rate was ZnO concentration-dependent. L-histidine, a known quencher of hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen, significantly attenuated bacterial inactivation, suggesting a Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-mediated antimicrobial mechanism. ZnO nanoparticle size decreased from similar to 250 nm to similar to 100 nm after sonication, potentially allowing ZnO to more easily penetrate cell membranes, while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of L. innocua suspended in 40 mM ZnO imply ZnO adheres on the surface of bacteria. ZnO-bacterial surface interactions can cause cell membrane damage and even cell death. The proposed technology has potential for sanitizing fresh produce industry wash-water.", "label": 0}

It is found that moderate concentration of NaCl can dramatically stimulate the growth of S. europaea plants. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the phenomenon, morphological and physiological changes of S. europaea in response to different ions, including cations (Na+, K+, Li+, Cs+) and anions (Cl-, NO3 (-), CH3COO-) were investigated, and the effects of Na+, Cl- and K+ on the growth of S. europaea were also studied. Na+ was more effective than K+ and Cl- in stimulating shoot succulence, cell expansion, and stomatal opening. Plants treated with Na+ (including NaCl, Na+, NaNO3) showed better plant growth, increased photosynthesis and less cell membrane damage than those untreated and treated with 200 mM of Cl- and K+ (including KCl and KNO3). Both SEM-X-Ray microanalysis and flame emission results revealed that well developed S. europaea plants had a higher content of sodium but lower potassium and chlorine.

Among the family of platinum (IV)-based compounds, a member known as CPA-7 inhibits the growth of multiple cancer cell lines. However, how and to what extent CPA-7 elicits its anti-prostate cancer effects in vivo is largely unknown. METHODS: In this study, we firstly assessed the potential toxicity of the synthesized CPA-7 in a prostate cancer model as well as in normal mice. Next, we evaluated the in vitro effects of CPA-7 on the growth of prostate cancer cells using cell counting assay, and calculated the tumor sizes and cumulative survival rate of the tumor bearing mice by Kaplan-Meier method during CPA-7 treatment. Then we measured the expression level of the activated form of STAT3 (one targets of CPA-7) and its transcriptive activity post CPA-7 treatment by synergistically using western blot, IHC, and firefly luciferase reporter assays. Finally, effects of CPA-7 on immune cell trafficking in the tumor draining lymph nodes and in the spleens are evaluated with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Treatment with CPA-7 significantly inhibited growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and also in mice resulting in a prolonged survival and a decreased recurrence rate. These therapeutic effects are due, at least in part, to functional depletion of STAT3 in prostate tumor tissue as well as in the surrounding areas of tumor cell invasion. CPA-7 treatment also resulted in a reduced level of regulatory T cells and increased levels of cytotoxic T and T helper cells in the spleen and in tumor infiltrating lymph nodes. This favorable effect on immune cell trafficking may account for the amnestic immune response against recurrent prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: CPA-7 is a promising new therapeutic agent for prostate cancer that both inhibits tumor cell proliferation and stimulates anti-tumor immunity. It has potential as first line treatment and/or as an adjuvant for refractory prostate cancer.", "label": 0}

Gomisin J derivatives were active in preventing p24 production from acutely HIV-1-infected H9 cells. The selective indices (toxic dose/effective dose) of these compounds were as high as > 300 in some systems. 1506 was active against 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine-resistant HIV-1 and acted synergistically with AZT and 2',3'-ddC. 1506 inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) in vitro but not HIV-1 protease. From the time-of-addition experiment, 1506 was found to inhibit the early phase of the HIV life cycle. A 1506-resistant HIV mutant was selected and shown to possess a mutation within the RT-coding region (at position 188 [Tyr to Leu]). The mutant RT expressed in Escherichia coli was resistant to 1506 in the in vitro RT assay. Some of the HIV strains resistant to other nonnucleoside HIV-1 RT inhibitors were also resistant to 1506. Comparison of various gomisin J derivatives with gomisin J showed that iodine, bromine, and chlorine in the fourth and ninth positions increased RT inhibitory activity as well as cytoprotective activity.", "label": 0}

However, there is little direct evidence for the effectiveness of cleaning because it has never been afforded scientific status. Hospital hygiene is usually assessed visually, but this does not necessarily correlate with microbiological risk. A more robust case for hospital cleaning can be presented by considering the evidence for all the stages of the staphylococcal transmission cycle between human beings and their environment. Cleaning has already been accepted as an important factor in the control of other hardy environmental pathogens, such as Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, norovirus, and Acinetobacter spp. This Review will show why the removal of dirt might have more impact on the control of MRSA than previously thought.

Talaporfin sodium (NPe6) is a second-generation photosensitizer. Methods We evaluated the toxic effects of different combinations of laser and NPe6 doses on squamous cell carcinoma (KLN205) and sarcoma (Meth A) cell lines. The cells were incubated with 0, 5, 10, or 30 ?g/mL NPe6 for 24 h. The cells were then irradiated with 0, 5, 15, or 30 mW/cm2 of laser power, and 0, 1, 5, 10, or 20 J/cm2 of laser energy. Cell viability was evaluated after 24 h. We also evaluated the cytotoxic effects of continuous wave or square-wave modulated laser irradiations (2, 5, or 10 Hz, 50% duty) on Meth A cells. Results The median lethal doses of NPe6 against the KLN205 and Meth A cells after treatment at a fluence rate of 15 mW/cm2 and a light dose of 20 J/cm2 were 18.6 and 5.0 ?g/mL, respectively. Meth A cells were more sensitive to PDT than KLN205 cells. There was no significant difference between the effects of continuous wave and square-wave modulated lasers on Meth A cell viability. Conclusions NPe6 PDT induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner in KLN205 and Meth A cells. More work is required to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of square-wave modulated laser therapy at low light doses.", "label": 0}

The influence of this chemistry on inactivation of chlorine-resistant microorganisms was investigated using Bacillus subtilis endospores as model microbial agents and simulated and natural solar radiation as light sources. Irradiation of FAC solutions markedly enhanced inactivation of B. subtilis spores in 10 mM phosphate buffer; increasing inactivation rate constants by as much as 600%, shortening inactivation curve lag phase by up to 73% and lowering CTs required for 2 log10 inactivation by as much as 71% at pH 8.0 and 10 \u00b0C.

Solar radiation alone did not inactivate B. subtilis spores under the conditions investigated.

Cells from both species were irradiated with UVA/UVB in vitro. Using the alkaline (B. schlosseri) and the neutral (S. hystrix) versions of the comet assay, DNA damage and repair were measured. After 24 h, little DNA repair was recorded in the irradiated Botryllus cells for both types of radiation (UVB 3.55 W/s/UVA 8.09 W/s, 15 min radiation each), revealing twice (30%) as much apoptotic cells as controls. Cells of S. hystrix showed a highly efficient DNA repair capacity (i.e. complete DNA repair within 30 min post-irradiation), coincident with their endurance to reactive oxygen species impacts. Therefore, while S. hystrix and likely other shallow water corals use efficient DNA repair mechanisms, B. schlosseri and possibly other similar species are reliant on UVR sheltered sites to maintain DNA integrity. The low repair capacity of B. schlosseri might be explained by the \u2018disposable soma\u2019 concept, where zooidal soma in this species is cast off and recycled on a weekly basis.

The ability of DACA to overcome \"atypical\" (topoisomerase II-mediated) multidrug resistance has been hypothesised to stem from its dual topoisomerase I/II specificity. We investigated the topoisomerase specificity of DACA and its 7-chloro derivative (C1-DACA) using camptothecin and amsacrine as control compounds. In cell-free assays employing supercoiled plasmid DNA, C1-DACA at 5 microM induced topoisomerase I-mediated DNA breakage, indicating cleavable complex formation (poisoning), and at 10 microM it inhibited relaxation of DNA, consistent with suppression (self-inhibition) of poisoning. In this assay, DACA provided no evidence of poisoning of this enzyme but inhibited its function at concentrations above 10 microM. In DNA cleavage assays utilising purified topoisomerase II, DACA induced breakage of supercoiled plasmid DNA at 5 microM whereas C1-DACA showed very weak poisoning at 1 microM and inhibition at 5 microM. Under conditions required for the assay of DNA relaxation, C1-DACA, but not DACA, inhibited topoisomerase II action at 5 microM. The actions of DACA and C1-DACA could also be distinguished by their ability to form DNA-protein cross-links in H460 human lung carcinoma cells as measured by precipitation of DNA-protein complexes with sodium dodecyl sulfate and potassium chloride. Both drugs stimulated the formation of complexes at low concentrations but inhibited formation at high concentrations. In survival assays with H460 cells, both drugs demonstrated biphasic responses with self-inhibition of cytotoxicity at intermediate drug concentrations. It was concluded that although both drugs have dual topoisomerase I/II specificity, DACA preferentially poisons topoisomerase II and C1-DACA preferentially poisons topoisomerase I. In addition, drug-induced inhibition of topoisomerase action at higher drug concentrations may mask poisoning in the cell-free assays as well as masking cytotoxicity in cultured cells. A model in which drug binding occludes topoisomerase-binding sites on the DNA can explain this self-inhibition of cytotoxic action.", "label": 0}

There are many unresolved and controversial issues in the diagnosis of this heterogeneous group of uncommon disorders in children. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion as the initial clinical manifestations are subtle, highly variable and non-specific. There is no consensus for the clinical diagnostic criteria of paediatric ILD. The spectrum of clinical findings is highly variable. The diagnostic evaluation of a child with suspected ILD includes a comprehensive history, physical examination, oxygen saturation (at rest, during exercise or during feeding), a plain chest x ray and a high-resolution thin-cut tomography scan of the chest. Pulmonary function studies can be useful in older children; these typically show a restrictive pattern with a decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and total lung capacity, but normal FEV1/FVC. A systematic approach to diagnosis is useful in the evaluation of an infant or child with suspected chronic ILD.

Drugs such as azithromycin were reported to block the apicoplast development that leads to unusual phenotypes affecting the parasite. This phenomenon suggests that identification of new apicoplast inhibitors will aid in the anti-malarial drug discovery. Therefore, in this study, we developed a computational model to predict apicoplast inhibitors by applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. METHODS: We have used two high-throughput chemical screening data (AID-504850, AID-504848) from PubChem BioAssay database and applied machine learning techniques. The performance of the models were assessed on various types of binary fingerprints. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a robust computational algorithm for the prediction of apicoplast inhibition. We observed 73.7% sensitivity and 84% specificity along with 81.4% accuracy rate only on 41 PubChem fingerprints on 48 hrs dataset. Similarly, an accuracy rate of 75.8% was observed for 96 hrs dataset. Additionally, we observed that our model has ~70% positive prediction rate on the independent dataset obtained from ChEMBL-NTD database. Furthermore, the fingerprint analysis suggested that compounds with at least one heteroatom containing hexagonal ring would most likely belong to the antimalarial category as compared to simple aliphatic compounds. We also observed that aromatic compounds with oxygen and chlorine atoms were preferred in inhibitors class as compared to sulphur. Additionally, the compounds with average molecular weight >380Da and XlogP>4 were most likely to belong to the inhibitor category. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the significance of simple interpretable molecular properties along with some preferred substructure in designing the novel anti-malarial compounds. In addition to that, robustness and accuracy of models developed in the present work could be utilized to screen a large chemical library.

The extracts were 2-8 times more mutagenic in TA100 than in TA98, and the mutagenic potencies of the water extracts ranked similarly in both strains: Cl2 > O3 + Cl2 > NH2Cl > O3 + NH2Cl > O3 > raw. 3-Chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX), which was estimated to account for approximately 20% of the mutagenic activity of the extracts, was shown to be the most potent compound tested thus far in a prophage-induction assay in Escherichia coli and a forward-mutation assay in Salmonella TM677. The mutations in approximately 2,000 revertants of TA98 and TA100 induced by MX and the water extracts were analyzed by colony probe hybridization and polymerase chain reaction/DNA sequence analysis. The water extracts and MX produced similar mutation spectra, which consisted in TA100 of predominantly of GC-->TA transversions in the second position of the CCC (or GGG) target of the hisG46 allele. This spectrum resembles that produced by large aromatic compounds and is distinct from that produced by alkylating agents and the semivolatile drinking water mutagen dichloroacetic acid. In TA98, MX and those water extracts resulting from the introduction of the chlorine atom produced 50-70% hotspot 2-base deletions and 30-50% complex frameshifts (frameshifts with an adjacent base substitution--mostly GC-->TA transversions as found in TA100). No other compound or mixture is known to induce such high frequencies of complex frameshifts. These results suggest that MX and \"MX-like\" compounds (possibly halogenated aromatics, such as halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) account for much of the mutagenic activity and specificity of the nonvolatile organics in drinking water and that these halogenated organics are especially capable of promoting misincorporation by the DNA replication complex. This study provides further evidence that the mutation spectrum of a complex mixture reflects the dominance of one or a few classes of chemical mutagens within the mixture.", "label": 0}

Relatively high temperatures (?70\u00a0\u00b0C) are required to effect thermal inactivation of the polyomaviruses. The chemical inactivants that are effective (?-propiolactone, ethanol, sodium hydroxide, and formaldehyde) are those that have displayed efficacy for other small, non-enveloped viruses, such as the circoviruses. Low pH inactivation can be effective, especially at pH at or below 3 and at higher temperatures. Polyomaviruses are more resistant to UV-C irradiation than are other small non-enveloped viruses such as the parvoviruses and caliciviruses. The efficacy of photodynamic inactivation of polyomaviruses is very much dye-dependent, with toluidine blue, acridine orange, and methylene blue dyes being effective photosensitizers. Ionizing radiation can be effective, depending on the conditions employed and the inactivation matrix. Inactivation of the oncogenic properties of the polyomaviruses may require higher doses of inactivant than those required to inactivate infectivity. While the polyomaviruses are considered to be highly resistant to inactivation, the degree of resistance is dependent upon the specific approach under consideration. For certain approaches, such as UV-C and gamma-irradiation, the polyomaviruses appear to be more resistant than other small non-enveloped viruses.", "label": 1}

Triclosan has broad-spectrum anti-microbial activity against most gram-neg. and gram-pos. bacteria. It is widely used in personal care products, household items, medical devices, and clin. settings. Due to its extensive use, there is potential for humans in all age groups to receive life-time exposures to triclosan, and, indeed, triclosan has been detected in human tissues and the environment. Data gaps exist regarding the chronic dermal toxicity and carcinogenicity of triclosan, which is needed for the risk assessment of triclosan. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) nominated triclosan to the National Toxicol. Program (NTP) for toxicol. evaluations. Currently, the NTP is conducting several dermal toxicol. studies to det. the carcinogenic potential of triclosan, evaluate its endocrine and developmental-reproductive effects, and investigate the potential UV-induced dermal formation of chlorinated phenols and dioxins of triclosan.

The research involved three stages. In the first stage, NaCl electrolytes were used, and the effect of electrolyte concn. and pH value on AC generation rate was studied. The second stage involved the combined effect of adding CaCl2 and NaF to the electrolyte on AC current efficiency. The disinfection efficiency of the generated AC from electrolytes of different constituents was investigated in the final stage. Use of electrolytes of low initial pH value and with low concns. (<25 mg/L) decreased the generation rate of AC. Adding CaCl2 to the electrolyte in ratios up to 25% increased both disinfection and current efficiencies of AC. However, adding NaF to the electrolyte in concns. ?1 g/L did not affect AC current efficiency, which means that water disinfection and fluoridation of water can be conducted simultaneously. Because NaCl and CaCl2 are available as by products of potassium manufg. in the Dead Sea area in Jordan, generation of AC from electrolytes contg. both NaCl and CaCl2 is highly feasible.

Inactivation of sul1, tetG, and intI1 underwent increased doses of three disinfectors, and chlorine disinfection achieved more inactivation of ARGs and intI1 genes (chlorine dose of 160 mg/L with contact time of 120 min for 2.98-3.24 log reductions of ARGs) than UV irradiation (UV dose of 12,477 mJ/cm(2) for 2.48-2.74 log reductions of ARGs) and ozonation disinfection (ozonation dose of 177.6 mg/L for 1.68-2.55 log reductions of ARGs). The 16S rDNA was more efficiently removed than ARGs by ozone disinfection. The relative abundance of selected genes (normalized to 16S rDNA) increased during ozonation and with low doses of UV and chlorine disinfection. Inactivation of sul1 and tetG showed strong positive correlations with the inactivation of intI1 genes (for sul1, R (2) = 0.929 with p < 0.01; for tetG, R (2) = 0.885 with p < 0.01). Compared to other technologies (ultraviolet disinfection, ozonation disinfection, Fenton oxidation, and coagulation), chlorination is an alternative method to remove ARGs from wastewater effluents.

Methods and Results: Cutting boards (bamboo, wood and plastic) and food contact surfaces (stainless steel and glazed ceramic tile) were inoculated with V. parahaemolyticus. Viable cells of V. parahaemolyticus were detected on all cutting boards and food contact surfaces after 10 and 30 min, respectively, at room temperatures. Soaking inoculated food contact surfaces and cutting boards in distilled water for 1 and 3 min, respectively, resulted in various reductions of V. parahaemolyticus, but failed to remove the organism completely from surfaces. However, the treatment of EO water [pH 2.7, chlorine 40 ppm, oxidation-reduction potential 1151 mV] for 30, 45, and 60 s, completely inactivated V. parahaemolyticus on stainless steel, ceramic tile, and plastic cutting boards, respectively. Conclusions: EO water could be used as a disinfecting agent for inactivating V. parahaemolyticus on plastic and wood cutting boards and food contact surfaces. Significance and Impact of the study: Rinsing the food contact surfaces with EO water or soaking cutting boards in EO water for up to 5 min could be a simple strategy to reduce cross-contamination of V. parahaemolyticus during food preparation.", "label": 1}

According to TDR/WHO, existing leads with proven schistosomicidal activity, like meclonazepam, might be the objects of further exploration. Here, we decided to investigate if the benzodiazepine binding sites that we recently characterized in adult Schistosoma mansoni could represent the molecular target of meclonazepam for its effect on worm motility and morphological appearance. The EC50 of meclonazepam for its contracturant effect is 10\u201320 times lower than its IC50 for binding to the worm benzodiazepine binding sites. On the contrary, benzodiazepines like flunitrazepam and diazepam have affinities at least 50 times higher than meclonazepam for these binding sites but did not induce contraction of the worms. We also confirmed the existence of a great similarity between the appearance, kinetics, Emax and external calcium dependency of the contractile effect of praziquantel and meclonazepam. Based on computer-aided molecular modeling calculations, we verified that a certain structural similarity exists between the active enantiomers of both drugs. We further proposed the hypothesis of common pharmacophoric elements including amide and imine subunits and the asymmetric carbons of S-(+)-meclozepam and R-(?)-praziquantel. As a whole, the present data indicate that the contracturant effect of meclonazepam is not a result of its binding to the worm benzodiazepine binding sites but that it shares some basic transduction pathway with praziquantel, even if not through identical molecular targets or binding sites.", "label": 0}

Treatment with ACNU or irradiation caused a dose dependent DNA damage which was detected by measuring the length of migration of fragmentary DNA in individual cells. Wild type C6 cells treated with ACNU (0, 10, 30, 60 micrograms ml-1) for one hour showed longer distance of migration of DNA than the ACNU-resistant subtype cells (C6R), indicating that ACNU-sensitive C6 cells were more vulnerable to ACNU than C6R cells. The results of DNA migration in C6 and C6R cells treated with ACNU were consistent with that from MTT assay which had been regarded as a standard method for chemosensitivity test. Furthermore, a time course study for DNA repair activity of C6 and C6R cells was also performed by measuring the length of DNA migration after incubation (0, 15, 30, 60, 120 min) of cells treated with 60 micrograms ml-1 ACNU. C6R cells repaired DNA damage more rapidly than C6 cells. In addition, the technique was also used to measure the DNA damage in C6 cells exposed to 0, 2, 6, 8, 10 Gy of x-ray irradiation, and a dose-dependent DNA migration after radiation injury was observed. This technique appears to be simple and useful for assessing chemosensitivity or radiosensitivity in individual glioma cells. TAX - RATTUS", "label": 0}

We found striking differences between the pteridine derivatives: whereas aromatic pterins with a hydroxy function at side chain atom C-2' increased the growth inhibition, those with a 7,8-dihydro structure exerted a suppressive effect. These results are in excellent agreement with previously observed effects of pteridine derivatives on chloramine-Tr-induce luminol-dependent chemiluminescence, and together, are highly suggestive of a general interaction of these compounds with oxygen or chlorine free radicals.

These subjects Were compared to 38 ageand sex-matched control subjects who did not abuse drugs. HIV-1 and HTLV serostatus was determined by repetitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by immunoblot. Lymphocyte subsets were determined by twocolor flow cytometry. Lymphocyte function was measured by proliferative response to plant mitogens and by natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity to a tumor cell target. results: Significant differences were seen in lymphocyte phenotype in the methadone-treated group, with elevations in the T-cell helper subset CD4+CD29+; in CD8 and CD8+I2+ cells, suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and activated suppressor/cytotoxic T cells; and in CD2+CD26+ cells and activated total T lymphocytes. Lymphocyte function was suppressed in the methadone group, with poor responses to pokeweed mitogen and phytohemagglutinin in culture. Moreover, NK-cell cytotoxicity was significantly reduced in the methadone group. None of these immunologic differences were attributable to HTLV serostatus. conclusion: The immune abnormalities seen suggest that a clinically significant degree of immune impairment exists in methadone-treated intravenous drug users. However, these abnormalities could not be explained by the presence of other retroviruses in this HIV-1-negative study group, as there was no significant difference in immune function when HTLV-seropositive patients were compared to HTLV-seronegative subjects treated with methadone.", "label": 0}

After the initial 3-h adhesion and in subsequent 1-day intervals, cell numbers were determined using standard plate count after swabbing the cells from the glass surface. The three-dimensional structure of in situ biofilms was determined by confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). After 3 h incubation, bacterial cells for all 13 strains of L. monocytogenes were found attached to glass slides and all strains formed biofilms within 24 h. The strains varied significantly in their ability to adhere to the surface and significant differences for cell numbers after 24 h biofilm growth were found. Cell counts in biofilms formed by five L. monocytogenes strains were monitored over 4 days. The counts increased for the first 2 days reaching 105cfu/cm2, except for L. monocytogenes 7148 (104 cfu/cm2). After 2 days, cell counts remained at 105cfu/cm2 for four strains (tested on days 3 and 4), while L. monocytogenes 7148 continued to grow and reached 105 cfu/cm2 on day 4. This difference in biofilm growth was not related to variations in growth rates of planktonic cells suggesting that growth behaviour of Listeria in biofilms may be different from their planktonic growth. CSLM revealed that the biofilms grown under static conditions consisted of two distinct layers with 0.5 log10 higher cell numbers in the bottom layer as compared to the upper layer.", "label": 0}

To determine the selective toxicity of these compounds, the human colon cancer cell line Caco2 and primary cultures of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were also investigated. The new thioureides were obtained in a three-step-reaction process and subsequently characterized by their physical constants (melting point, solubility). The chemical structures were elucidated by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR spectral methods and elemental analysis. The analyses confirmed the final and intermediate compound structures and the synthesis. The compounds were then tested on the parasites in vitro. All thioureides, except two compounds with a nitro group, were totally ineffective against Giardia lamblia. 23 compounds inhibited the proliferation of T. gondii, three of them with an IC50 of approximately 1\u00a0?M. The structural integrity of E. multilocularis metacestodes was affected by 22 compounds.

Two PGF2? products are currently approved in the United States for luteolysis in lactating dairy cattle, dinoprost tromethamine and cloprostenol sodium. Cloprostenol has a longer half-life compared with dinoprost, is more resistant to endogenous metabolism, and is maintained in circulation longer. We hypothesized that cloprostenol could reduce the time to complete luteolysis compared with dinoprost because of differences in half-life. Lactating dairy cows received the same presynchronization strategy (G6G; 25 mg of PGF2? \u2013 2 d \u2013 100 ?g of GnRH \u2013 6 d \u2013 100 ?g of GnRH \u2013 7 d \u2013 final PGF2? treatment). At the time of the final PGF2?, cows (n = 35) were randomly assigned to receive either 500 ?g of cloprostenol or 25 mg of dinoprost. Blood samples were collected daily before and serially after PGF2? treatment to analyze circulating concentrations of progesterone (P4) and estradiol (E2). Ultrasound examinations of ovaries were performed to measure sizes of follicles and corpora lutea (CL) and determine time of ovulation. Considering only cows with complete luteolysis, mean circulating P4 was lower for cows given cloprostenol than for those given dinoprost between 0 and 12 h postinjection, but not at 24, 36, or 48 h.

Serum concentrations of E2 were greater at 48 h posttreatment in cloprostenol-treated cows (2.74 \u00b1 0.15 pg/mL) than in dinoprost-treated cows (2.37 \u00b1 0.19 pg/mL).

{"id": "8141", "title": "Concentration-dependence of the explosion characteristics of chlorine dioxide gas", "abstract": "The explosion characteristics of chlorine dioxide gas have been studied for the first time in a cylindrical exploder with a shell capacity of 20 L The experimental results have indicated that the lower concentration limit for the explosive decomposition of chlorine dioxide gas is 9.5% ([ClO(2)]/[air]), whereas there is no corresponding upper concentration limit. Under the experimental conditions, and within the explosion limits, the pressure of explosion increases with increasing concentration of chlorine dioxide gas: the maximum pressure of explosion relative to the initial pressure was measured as 0.024 MPa at 10% ClO(2) and 0.641 MPa at 90% ClO(2). The induction time (the time from the moment of sparking to explosion) has also been found to depend on the concentration of chlorine dioxide gas; thus, at 10% ClO(2) the induction time was 2195 ms, but at 90% ClO(2) the induction time was just 8 ms. The explosion reaction mechanism of ClO(2) is of a degenerate chain-branching type involving the formation of a stable intermediate (Cl(2)O(3)). from which the chain-branching occurs. Chain initiation takes place at the point of ignition and termination takes place at the inner walls of the exploder. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "label": 0}

It was shown that the hydrolyzed nanofibers could serve as an N-halamine precursor through chlorination of the amide groups obtained by partial hydrolysis of the nitrile groups. The hydrolysis conditions were optimized, so that sufficient chlorine for effective antibacterial activities could be obtained on the surfaces. The chemical and physical structural changes were well characterized with FTIR, TGA, DSC and SEM. It was found that even though the hydrolyzed nanofibers cyclized with ionic and free radical mechanisms, the chlorinated nanofibers cyclized with only free radical mechanism as evidenced by its higher onset of cyclization temperature. On the other hand, the hydrolysis and chlorination process significantly improved the mechanical properties of the nanofibers. Moreover, the chlorinated nanofibers showed potent antibacterial activities against S. aureus and E. coli with about 6 logs inactivation. The developed antibacterial PAN nanofibers possess great potential for use in various fields, medical industry in particular.", "label": 1}

In this study, left-censored datasets of norovirus (genogroup I and II), and adenovirus were used to calculate the virus reduction efficiency in unit processes of secondary biological treatment and chlorine disinfection. Virus concentration in influent, effluent from the secondary treatment, and chlorine-disinfected effluent of four municipal wastewater treatment plants were analyzed by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach, and the probabilistic distributions of log reduction (LR) were estimated by a Bayesian estimation algorithm. The mean values of LR in the secondary treatment units ranged from 0.9 and 2.2, whereas those in the free chlorine disinfection units were from -0.1 and 0.5. The LR value in the secondary treatment was virus type and unit process dependent, which raised the importance for accumulating the data of virus LR values applicable to the multiple-barrier system, which is a global concept of microbial risk management in wastewater reclamation and reuse.", "label": 0}
{"id": "9285", "title": "Photodynamic inactivation of chlorin e6-loaded CTAB-liposomes against Candida albicans", "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a promising therapeutic modality for the treatment of local infections. To increase the efficacy of PDI, chlorine e6 (Ce6) was encapsulated in cationic CTAB-liposomes composed of various ratios of dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and the cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). The PDI efficacy of the liposomal-Ce6 was assessed in vitro against susceptible and drug-resistant clinical isolates of Candida albicans (C. albicans) as well as in infected burn wounds. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ce6 was encapsulated in CTAB-liposomes by the film hydration method. Particle size distribution and zeta potential of the cationic liposomes were measured using a Zetasizer Nano-ZS. UV-visible spectra were used to measure lipid/Ce6 (L/C) ratio and drug entrapment efficiency while differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to study the thermotropic behavior of DMPC liposomes upon CTAB addition. In vivo PDI efficacy was carried out in an infected burn wound using a rat model. RESULTS: The increase in zeta potential and a shift in the phase transition temperature (Tm ) upon CTAB addition confirmed its entrapment within the lipid bilayers of the liposome. Meanwhile, the CTAB addition did not affect the Ce6 entrapment efficiency and physical attributes of the liposomes. In vitro studies showed that the PDI effect of the Ce6-loaded CTAB-liposomes was dependent on the lipid to Ce6 molar ratio (L/C), particle size and the concentration of CTAB in the liposomes. The lower L/C ratio and smaller liposomes exerted significantly higher PDI effects. In addition, an increase in the CTAB to lipid ratio led to a significant increase in the PDI effect of Ce6 against susceptible and drug-resistant clinical isolates of C. albicans after light illumination. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a low L/C ratio, high positive charge, and small particle size of CTAB-liposomes significantly enhances their PDI efficacy against C. albicans.", "label": 0}

However, the mechanism of its salt tolerance is not well understood. In this study, plant growth, water status, content and distribution of inorg. ions, cell membrane permeability, and proline content of I. lactea under salt stress were investigated using nutrient solns. with six NaCl concns. ranging from 0 to 350 mmol L-1. The results indicated that the biomass, height, fresh wt., K+ content, and K+/Na+ and Ca2+/Na+ ratios decreased with increasing NaCl stress, whereas plant water deficit and contents of Na+ and Cl- increased with increasing NaCl stress. In all salt treatments, water deficit of shoots was found to be higher than that of roots and had a pos. correlation with salt concn. When the NaCl concn. was less than 280 mmol L-1, the ion absorption selectivity ratio and the transportation selectivity ratio sharply increased with increasing NaCl stress. Under medium salt stress, I. lactea exhibited a strong K+ selective absorption and the transportation of K+ from roots to shoots increased, whereas Na+ was not transported and was mostly retained in roots. The plants were able to maintain osmotic adjustment through the accumulation of Na+, Cl-, and proline. On the basis of its biomass prodn. under salt stress, I. lactea could be considered as a facultative halophyte. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

Chlorinated compounds, mainly sodium hypochlorite, are the most used in Brazil, but the formation of trihalomethanes from this sanitizer is a drawback. Then, the search for alternative methods to sodium hypochlorite has been emerging as a matter of great interest. The suitability of chlorine dioxide (60 mg L(-1)/10 min), peracetic acid (100 mg L(-1)/15 min) and ozonated water (1.2 mg L(-1)/1 min) as alternative sanitizers to sodium hypochlorite (150 mg L(-1) free chlorine/15 min) were evaluated. Minimally processed lettuce washed with tap water for 1 min was used as a control. Microbiological analyses were performed in triplicate, before and after sanitization, and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 days of storage at 2 +/- 1 degrees C with the product packaged on LDPE bags of 60 mum. It was evaluated total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., psicrotrophic and mesophilic bacteria, yeasts and molds. All samples of minimally processed lettuce showed absence of E. coli and Salmonella spp. The treatments of chlorine dioxide, peracetic acid and ozonated water promoted reduction of 2.5, 1.1 and 0.7 log cycle, respectively, on count of microbial load of minimally processed product and can be used as substitutes for sodium hypochlorite. These alternative compounds promoted a shelf-life of six days to minimally processed lettuce, while the shelf-life with sodium hypochlorite was 12 days.", "label": 1}

Pre-set concentrations were used according to the volumes of the rooms and garages. Three cycles were performed with increasing contact times. Repetitive experiments were performed using Bacillus atrophaeus (formerly Bacillus subtilis) Raven 1162282 spores to control the effect of decontamination; after a sampling plan, spore strips were placed in various positions in rooms, ambulances, and inside and outside the items of medical equipment. Decontamination was effective in 87% of 146 spore tests in closed test rooms and in 100% of 48 tests in a surgical department when using three cycles. One or two cycles had no effect. The sporicidal effect on internal parts of the medical equipment was only 62.3% (220 tests). When the devices were run and ventilated during decontamination, 100% (57/57) of spore strips placed inside were decontaminated. In the ambulances, the penetration of H2O2 into equipment, devices, glove boxes, under mattresses, and the drivers' cabins was 100% (60/60 tests) when using three cycles, but was less effective when using one or two cycles. In conclusion, an H2O2 dry fumigation system, run in three cycles, seemed to have a good sporicidal effect when used in rooms, ambulances, and external and internal parts of ventilated equipment. Further studies need to be performed concerning concentration, contact time and the number of cycles of H2O2.

In this study, we compared the surface charge and hydrophobicity of two cantaloupe-related outbreak strains of Salmonella Poona (RM2350 and G-91-1595) to those of 14 additional Salmonella strains using electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The relative abilities of the 16 strains to attach to cantaloupe surfaces and resist removal by washing with water, chlorine (200 ppm), or hydrogen peroxide (2.5%) for 5 min after a storage period of up to 7 days at 5 to 20 degrees C also were determined. Whole cantaloupes were inoculated with each pathogen at 8.36 log CFU/ml, dried for 1 h inside a biosafety cabinet, stored, and then subjected to the washing treatments. Only the positive surface charge of the two cantaloupe-related strains of Salmonella Poona was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the other strains. Initial bacterial attachment to cantaloupe surfaces ranged from 3.68 to 4.56 log CFU/cm2 (highest values for Salmonella Michigan, Newport, Oranienburg, and Mbandaka). The average percentage of the total bacterial population strongly attached to the cantaloupe surface for the Salmonella serovars studied ranged from 0.893 to 0.946 at 5 degrees C and from 0.987 to 0.999 at 25 degrees C. Washing inoculated melons with water did not produce a significant reduction in the concentration of the pathogens (P > 0.05). Chlorine and hydrogen peroxide treatments caused an average 3-log reduction when applied 20 to 40 min postinoculation. However, sanitizer treatments applied 60 min or more postinoculation were less effective (approximately 2.5-log reduction). No significant differences were noted in sanitizer efficacy against the individual strains (P > 0.05). The two cantaloupe-related outbreak Salmonella Poona strains did not significantly differ from the other Salmonella strains tested in negative cell surface charge or hydrophobicity, were not more effective in attaching to whole melon surfaces, and were not more resistant to the various washing treatments when present on rinds.", "label": 1}

Starch casein, R2A and Inorganic salt starch agar at four different salinities (35, 50, 75 and 100\u00a0psu) were used for isolation. R2A agar at 35\u00a0psu was the most preferred by hypersaline actinomycetes. The dominant group was halotolerant Streptomyces spp. others being rare actinomycetes viz. Nocardiopsis, Micromonospora and Kocuria spp. More than 50% of the isolates showed anti-bacterial activity against one or more of the fifteen human pathogens tested. Eight strains from 4 genera showed consistent anti-bacterial activity and studied in detail. Most halotolerant isolates grew from 0 to 75\u00a0psu, with optimum antibiotic production at 35\u00a0psu whereas halophiles grew at 20 to 100\u00a0psu with optimum antibiotic production at 35\u00a0psu. Four Streptomyces strains showed multiple inhibition against test organisms while four rare actinomycetes were specific in their inhibitory activity. This is the first report of a halophilic Kocuria sp., Nocardiopsis sp., and halotolerant Micromonospora sp. producing anti-bacterial compound(s) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus citreus, and Vibrio cholerae, respectively.

The resulting models can be used as indicators to assess treatment plant performance. The models are capable of evaluating the filter system's response to changes in filtration rate, influent turbidity, and total particle counts.

Technicians ranked the same population of teats in the same rank order, but their mean values differed by half a score which probably could be related to the skin condition of their own fingers. Half udder experiments were carried out for 6 months at 4 farms with 35 to 52 cows each. A postmilking teat spray with 10% glycerol improved teat skin condition (p < 0.10) compared with no teat spray. A postmilking teat spray with 120 ppm chlorine dioxide did not influence teat skin condition compared with no teat spray. No differences in udder health could be proven between treatments. Control studies revealed that 10% glycerol as an emollient of a postmilking teat spray improved teat skin condition within 3 weeks from being slightly rough to being smooth for lactating cows (p < 0.05) but not for dry cows having smooth teat skin. Neither glycerol nor chlorine dioxide influenced absolute number of bacteria on teat skin after a challenge with Streptococcus uberis and Staphylococcus aureus but half life of S. aureus on unsprayed teats was longest (p = 0.05). Suckling made teat skin more rough than machine milking. Nevertheless, suckling lowered the number of esculin positive bacteria on the teat skin.

Among the compounds rationally designed for artificial regulation of gene expression, oligonucleotides can bind with a high specificity of recognition to the major groove of double helical DNA by forming Hoogsteen type bonds with purine bases of the Watson\u2013Crick base pairs, resulting in triple helix formation. Although the potential target sequences were originally restricted to polypurine\u00b7polypyrimidine sequences, considerable efforts were devoted to the extension of the repertoire by rational conception of appropriate derivatives. Efficient tools based on triple helices were developed for various biochemical applications such as the development of highly specific artificial nucleases. The antigene strategy remains one of the most fascinating fields of triplex application to selectively control gene expression. Targeting of genomic sequences is now proved to be a valuable concept on a still limited number of studies; local mutagenesis is in this respect an interesting application of triplex-forming oligonucleotides on cell cultures. Oligonucleotide penetration and compartmentalization in cells, stability to intracellular nucleases, accessibility of the target sequences in the chromatin context, the residence time on the specific target are all limiting steps that require further optimization. The existence and the role of three-stranded DNA in vivo, its interaction with intracellular proteins is worth investigating, especially relative to the regulation of gene transcription, recombination and repair processes.", "label": 0}
{"id": "3749", "title": "On the dependence of chlorine by-products generated species formation of the electrode material and applied charge during electrochemical water treatment", "abstract": "Chemical water treatment problems such as disinfection by-products formation have urged on the search of better water treatment technologies such as electrochemical water technologies which have been applied successfully in different water/wastewater pollutant removal. However, their wide extension is hindered by some technical problems such as chlorine by-products (CBPs) generated species. Indeed, during electrochemical process, these carcinogenic substances may be formed depending on the electrode material and applied voltage. This review concerns the dependence of CBPs generated species formation of the electrode material and applied charge during electrochemical water treatment. It is concluded that the use of electrodes producing highly reactive species must be more carefully controlled in hygienically and environmentally oriented applications. From this point of view, Pt and boron-doped diamond (BDD) anodes are proved more convenient than other electrodes. Indeed, the great capability of a BDD anode to produce reactive oxygen species and other oxidising species during the electrolysis allows establishing a chlorine-free disinfection process.

Maximum levels were set for food and feed products and criteria were developed for the analytical methods (both confirmatory and screening) used for official control measurements. Ideally, any analysis performed with the aim of comparing the result with the legal limits should be performed according to these criteria. It should also apply to monitoring, performed to estimate human exposure and trend analysis rather than compliance with limits, since risk assessments and EU-policies rely heavily on these data. In recent years, analytical capacity has largely increased to complement the additional testing. In line with the responsibility of producers for the safety of their products, self-control has strongly increased and has played an important role in the discovery of several of the incidents. However, the increased monitoring seems not to have resulted in a clear further decrease in the levels reported for food and feed in the last decade. This may in part be due to a lack of follow up when elevated levels (above action levels) are found, which would lead to a reduction of output from remaining sources. It may also be related to the sensitivity of applied methods and the data collected in databases. This paper reviews the incidents and developments that have taken place within the EU over the last 15 years in the area of dioxins and PCBs, including the role of applying screening and confirmatory methods for achieving the desired further reduction in the levels.", "label": 0}

Fresh mixed greens were left uninoculated or inoculated with approximately 6 log CFU/g of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, and L. monocytogenes and treated by immersion for 60 or 90 s in different wash solutions (1:150, wt/vol), including 50 ppm of chlorine solution acidified to pH 6.5, acidic electrolyzed water (pH 2.1 +/- 0.2, oxygen reduction potential of 1,100 mV, 30 to 35 ppm of free chlorine), and acidified sodium chlorite (1,200 ppm, pH 2.5). Samples were neutralized and homogenized. Bacterial survival was determined by standard spread plating on selective media. Each test case (organism x treatment x time) was replicated twice with five samples per replicate. There was no difference (P > or = 0.05) in the time of immersion on the antimicrobial effectiveness of the treatments. Furthermore, there was no difference (P > or = 0.05) in survival of the three organisms regardless of treatment or time. Acidified sodium chlorite, resulted in reductions in populations of 3 to 3.8 log CFU/g and was more effective than chlorinated water (2.1 to 2.8 log CFU/g reduction).

{"id": "6221", "title": "Resistance mechanisms of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds", "abstract": "A range of antimicrobial compounds (bactericides) commonly termed biocides, microbicides, sanitizers, antiseptics and disinfectants are available, all of which are claimed by their producers to kill bacteria. Resistance has been defined as the temporary or permanent ability of an organism and its progeny to remain viable and/or multiply under conditions that would destroy or inhibit other members of the strain. Bacteria may be defined as resistant when they are not susceptible to a concentration of antibacterial agent used in practice. Traditionally, resistance refers to instances where the basis of increased tolerance is a genetic change, and where the biochemical basis is known. Antimicrobial substances target a range of cellular loci, from the cytoplasmic membrane to respiratory functions, enzymes and the genetic material. However, different bacteria react differently to bactericides, either due to inherent differences such as unique cell envelope composition and non-susceptible proteins, or to the development of resistance, either by adaptation or by genetic exchange. At low concentrations bactericides often act bacteriostatically, and are only bacteriocidal at higher concentrations. For bactericides to be effective, they must attain a sufficiently high concentration at the target site in order to exert their antibacterial action. In order to reach their target site(s), they must traverse the outer membrane of the gram negative bacteria. Bacteria with effective penetration barriers to biocides generally display a higher inherent resistance than those bacteria which are readily penetrated. The rate of penetration is linked to concentration, so that a sufficiently high bactericide concentration will kill bacteria with enhanced penetration barriers. It has been indicated that susceptible bacterial isolates acquire increased tolerance to bactericides following serial transfer in sub-inhibitory concentrations. Whereas the basis of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is well know, that of resistance to antiseptics, disinfectants and food preservatives is less well understood. Three mechanisms of resistance that have been reported include: \u2022 limited diffusion of antimicrobial agents through the biofilm matrix, \u2022 interaction of the antimicrobial agents with the biofilm matrix (cells and polymer), \u2022 enzyme mediated resistance, \u2022 level of metabolic activity within the biofilm \u2022 genetic adaptation \u2022 efflux pumps and \u2022 outer membrane structure.", "label": 0}

The mussels were observed to co-exist in the cooling water circuits of a coastal power station that adopted intermittent chlorination as a fouling control technique. The five mussel species showed, in response to chlorination, 100% mortality at significantly different exposure times, indicating significant species-specific variability in chlorine tolerance. For example, at 1 mg l(-1) residual chlorine, B. variabilis and P. viridis took 288 and 816 h, respectively, to achieve 100% mortality. The time taken for 100% mortality decreased with increasing chlorine residual concentration. The effect of mussel size (= mussel age) of P. viridis, P. perna, B. striatulus and M. philippinarum on mortality was significant between 1 and 5 mg l(-1) residual chlorine, with larger mussels showing greater resistance than smaller ones. All mussel species showed progressive reduction in physiological activities when chlorine residuals were increased from 0 to 1 mg l(-1). However, species-specific differences in the relative rate of physiological activities were observed. Accordingly, relative reduction in physiological activities in response to chlorination was the lowest in P. viridis and the highest in B. variabilis. The data clearly indicate significant differences in the lethal and sublethal responses of the five mussel species to chlorination. The results, therefore, suggest that for effective fouling control, chlorine treatment against mussels has to be employed judiciously, depending on the mussel species involved.", "label": 1}

The microbiological activity of compounds was tested by the diffusion and dilution methods on various species of bacteria. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of the substituents on antimicrobial activity. Material and methods: A series of new 3-cynnamoyl-4-hydroxycoumarins was prepared by the reaction of nucleophylic addition from 3-acetyl-4-hydroxycoumarin acting on appropriate aromatic aldehydes. The microbiological activity of compounds was tested by the diffusion and dilution methods on species of bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Echerichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Bordatella bronchiseptica, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphyloccocus aureus. Results: The synthesis of new 3-cynnamoyl-4-hydroxycoumarins was carried out.

In Western societies an estimated 10% to 25% of the population have allergic rhinitis, with 30 to 60 million persons being affected annually in the United States. It is estimated that sinusitis affects 31 million patients annually in the United States. Both rhinitis and sinusitis can significantly decrease quality of life, aggravate comorbid conditions, and require significant direct medical expenditures. Both conditions also create even greater indirect costs to society by causing lost work and school days and reduced workplace productivity and school learning. Management of allergic rhinitis involves avoidance, many pharmacologic options, and, in appropriately selected patients, allergen immunotherapy. Various types of nonallergic rhinitis are treated with avoidance measures and a more limited repertoire of medications. For purposes of this review, sinusitis and rhinosinusitis are synonymous terms. An acute upper respiratory illness of less than approximately 7 days' duration is most commonly caused by viral illness (viral rhinosinusitis), whereas acute bacterial sinusitis becomes more likely beyond 7 to 10 days. Although the mainstay of management of acute bacterial sinusitis is antibiotics, treatment of chronic sinusitis is less straightforward because only some chronic sinusitis cases have an infectious basis. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been subdivided into 3 types, namely CRS without nasal polyps, CRS with nasal polyps, and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis.

It is shown that P. syringae strain 31R1 produces antifungal lipodepsipeptides, syringomycins E and G, and, in addn., a novel and unique lipopeptide, peptin31.

Peptin31 displayed antifungal activities against Rhodotorula pilimanae, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichoderma harzianum and also hemolytic and antibacterial activities. Exts. of P. syringae strain 31R1 grown in medium with chloride were fungicidal, but not when grown without chloride.

Because hides are considered to be the principal source of EHEC and hide interventions have been shown to be very efficacious in the control of EHEC in beef processing plants, various hide-directed intervention strategies have been implemented in several veal processing plants to mitigate contamination. We evaluated the effectiveness of three different hide interventions used at veal processing plants: A, a water rinse followed by a manual curry comb of the hide; B, application of 200 ppm of chlorine followed by a hot water rinse; and C, a 5-min treatment with chlorine foam followed by a rinse with 180 to 200 ppm of acidified sodium chlorite.

Effective disinfection is important for inactivation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and disruption of antibiotic resistance genes. Ampicillin is a widely prescribed antibiotic but its effectiveness is increasingly undermined by resistance. In this study, changes in ampicillin resistance for Escherichia coli (E. coli) CGMCC 1.1595 were analyzed after exposure to different doses of ultraviolet (UV) or chlorine, and damage incurred by the plasmid encoding ampicillin resistance gene bla(TEM-1) was assessed. We reported a greater stability in ampicillinresistant E. coli CGMCC 1.1595 after UV irradiation or chlorination when compared with previously published data for other E. coli strains. UV irradiation and chlorination led to a shift in the mortality frequency distributions of ampicillin-resistant E. coli when subsequently exposed to ampicillin. The ampicillin hemiinhibitory concentration (IC50) without disinfection was 3800 mg.L-1, and an increment was observed after UV irradiation or chlorination. The IC50 of ampicillin-resistant E. coli was 1.5-fold higher at a UV dose of 40 mJ.cm(-2), and was 1.4-fold higher when exposed to 2.0 mg.L-1 chlorine. These results indicate that UV irradiation and chlorination can potentially increase the risk of selection for E. coli strains with high ampicillin resistance. There was no evident damage to bla(TEM-1) after 1-10 mg Cl-2.L-1 chlorination, while a UV dose of 80 mJ.cm(-2) yielded a damage ratio for bla(TEM-1) of approximately 1.2-log.

A half-factorial statistical experimental design was employed to reduce the number of assays. Temperature and pH were found to be by far the most important variables in explaining chlorine efficacy, that is 78% of the variability in the experimental domain studied (pH, 6.5-8.5; temperature, 7-22 degreesC; dissolved organic carbon (DOC), 0-5 mg/L, 0-5 nephelometric turbidity units (NTUs)). The interaction between pH and temperature was also significant, being the third most important factor, explaining 11% of the variability. For both MS2 phages and B. subtilis spores, hypochlorous acid efficacy was less sensitive than hypochlorite ions to a modification of water temperature. Such effect is not taken into account in the current United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) concentration-time (Ct) tables.

Samples of brain tissues were collected from affected fish and processed for RT-PCR amplification and virus isolation in cell culture. Infected E-11 cells exhibited cytopathic effect characteristic of betanodavirus. Histopathology of moribund fish showed pronounced vacuolations in the brain, spinal cord, and retina. An RT-PCR product of approximately 430 bp was amplified from the culture supernatant of betanodavirus-infected E-11 cells and sequenced. Sequencing of the T4 region of the coat protein gene (RNA 2) revealed clustering of the isolated virus within the red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus type. The pathogenicity of the isolated betanodavirus in healthy pompano juveniles and fry was determined via intramuscular injection and immersion challenges, respectively. Higher mortality rates were obtained in challenged fish compared with the controls. An inactivated vaccine was subsequently prepared by treating the clarified betanodavirus with formalin. Pompano juveniles intraperitoneally injected with the inactivated vaccine exhibited neutralizing antibodies from days 15 (mean titer 1:240) to 125 (1:560) with the highest titer noted at day 64 (1:2240) post-vaccination. Additionally, pompano fry bath-vaccinated and consequently bath-challenged with betanodavirus at day 35 post-vaccination showed higher survival rate compared with the control, indicating the potential of the inactivated betanodavirus vaccine against VNN in pompano fry and juveniles.", "label": 0}

The aim of using W18O49 is employing its capability of reacting with the absorbed O2 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) when exposed to a long-wavelength laser at 808 nm to increase skin penetration and body tolerance. In this work, we have demonstrated that W18O49 unit gives rise to more hypoxic tumor microenvironment and activates the prodrug TPZ to achieve hypoxia-activated chemotherapy, which could be monitored by the intracellular ROS/hypoxia detection and in vivo positron emission tomography imaging. In addition, the successful introduction of W18O49 into PL-W18O49-TPZ NPs could render the photothermal therapy under the irradiation of an 808 nm laser. As a result, in vivo antitumor results have clearly shown that PL-W18O49-TPZ NPs could efficiently erase the solid tumor tissues by means of simultaneous hypoxia-activated chemotherapy and photothermal therapy. In comparison to the costly small-molecule photosensitizer chlorine e6 used in hypoxia-activated chemotherapy, W18O49 NPs have two advantages of large-scale preparation and additional photothermal therapy effect, which could provide new insight into future clinical applications.", "label": 0}

As DNA is often the target for majority of anticancer and antibiotic drugs, study about the interaction of drug and DNA has a key role in pharmacology. Moreover, understanding the interactions of small molecules with DNA is of prime significance in the rational design of more powerful and selective anticancer agents. Two of the most important and promising targets in cancer chemotherapy include DNA alkylating agents and DNA intercalators. For these last the DNA recognition is a critical step in their anti-tumor action and the intercalation is not only one kind of the interactions in DNA recognition but also a pivotal step of several clinically used anti-tumor drugs such as anthracyclines, acridines and anthraquinones. To push clinical cancer therapy, the discovery of new DNA intercalators has been considered a practical approach and a number of intercalators have been recently reported. The intercalative binding properties of such molecules can also be harnessed as diagnostic probes for DNA structure in addition to DNA-directed therapeutics. Moreover, the problem of intercalation site formation in the undistorted B-DNA of different length and sequence is matter of tremendous importance in molecular modeling studies and, nowadays, three models of DNA intercalation targets have been proposed that account for the binding features of intercalators. Finally, despite DNA being an important target for several drugs, most of the docking programs are validated only for proteins and their ligands. Therefore, a default protocol to identify DNA binding modes which uses a modified canonical DNA as receptor is needed.", "label": 0}

Indirectly produced by human activities, they are released into the environment, as they are untargeted by conventional wastewater treatments. In order to understand the fate of ARGs and of other resistant forms (e.g., phenotypical adaptations) in urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), we monitored three WWTPs with different disinfection processes (chlorine, peracetic acid (PAA), and ultraviolet light (UV)). We monitored WWTPs influx and pre- and postdisinfection effluent over 24 h, followed by incubation experiments lasting for 96 h. We measured bacterial abundance, size distribution and aggregational behavior, the proportion of intact (active) cells, and the abundances of four ARGs and of the mobile element integron1. While all the predisinfection treatments of all WWTPs removed the majority of bacteria and of associated ARGs, of the disinfection processes only PAA efficiently removed bacterial cells. However, the stress imposed by PAA selected for bacterial aggregates and, similarly to chlorine, stimulated the selection of ARGs during the incubation experiment. This suggests disinfections based on chemically aggressive destruction of bacterial cell structures can promote a residual microbial community that is more resistant to antibiotics and, given the altered aggregational behavior, to competitive stress in nature.", "label": 1}

During a period of 3 weeks, approximately 65% of the incoming TCE was stably converted to unidentified products from which all three chlorine atoms were liberated. When toluene was subsequently omitted from the culture feed while TCE addition continued, mutants which were no longer able to grow on toluene or to degrade TCE appeared. These mutants were also unable to grow on phenol or m- or o-cresol but were still able to grow on catechol and benzoate. Plasmid analysis showed that the mutants had lost the plasmid involved in toluene monooxygenase formation (pTOM). Thus, although strain G4 is much less sensitive to TCE toxicity than methanotrophs, deleterious effects may still occur, namely, an increased maintenance energy demand in the presence of toluene and plasmid loss when np toluene is added.", "label": 0}

However, ortho chlorine substitution in the two phenyl rings gives each PCB its own pattern of toxicity which is different from the mechanism of action of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. The present study evaluated the effect of prenatal and postnatal exposure to a low dose of the mono-ortho pentachlorobiphenyl PCB 118 on thyroid hormone concentrations and EROD activity in rats. Moreover, the tissue distribution of PCB 118 following one oral dose was evaluated. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated by gavage on GD 6 with 375 microg of PCB 118/kg b.w. Decreases in thyroxine and TSH levels were observed in dams at the end of lactation. Perinatal exposure to a low dose of PCB 118 permanently disrupted the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis leading to a significant increase in thyroxine levels in offspring, as a 'thyroid resistance syndrome'. It is noteworthy that no changes in hepatic EROD activity were detected in dams at the end of lactation, even in the presence of high amounts of PCB in liver. Based on hepatic EROD activity (as a biomarker for aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) induction), the mechanism of thyroid homeostasis disruption seems to be AhR-independent. Additionally, the 'thyroid resistance syndrome' observed in our study indicates the need for further detailed investigations on the HPT axis. We conclude that not only TEF, but also AhR-independent responses should be taken into account for risk assessment of mono-ortho PCB congeners.", "label": 0}

To further understand this relationship the mutagenicity of 3 aromatic amines was determined in the Ames test, employing activation systems derived from rats maintained on an alcohol-containing liquid diet, an isocaloric control liquid diet or Aroclor 1254-pretreated animals fed standard laboratory chow. Depending upon protein and substrate concentrations, S9 from ethanol-fed rats was 30-50% less efficient than S9 from pair-fed rats in activating arylamines (2-aminofluorene, 2-aminoanthracene and 2-acetylaminofluorene) to mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100. Cytosolic fractions from ethanol-fed animals always resulted in greater arylamine activation than that of controls whereas the opposite was true of the microsomal compartment in which the ethanol-treated group was consistently less active than the controls. The cytosolic N-acetyltransferase activities with respect to 2 different substrates, isoniazid and 2-aminofluorene, were unaffected by ethanol consumption, indicating that this activity probably does not account for the different activation profiles exhibited by the ethanol and pair-fed cytosolic systems. Both the cytosolic and microsomal compartments are required for maximal expression of the mutagenicity of each arylamine however, each compartment can activate arylamines independently of the other. Reconstituting cytosol with microsomes from ethanol- and pair-fed rats, but not Aroclor-pretreated rats, resulted in a synergistic activation of the aromatic amines and displayed an effect similar to that of S9. Compared to Aroclor pretreatment and pair-fed controls, microsomes from ethanol-fed rats displayed the least capacity for activating any of the arylamines to mutagens. Microsomes from Aroclor-pretreated rats accounted for at least 80% of the S9-mediated activation of each of the arylamines to mutagenic metabolites which was in marked contrast to the contribution of the microsomal fractions to the S9 activity in the ethanol- (5-20% of S9 activity) and pair-fed systems (22-30% of S9 activity). The data indicate that 2 opposing reactions occur in S9, a cytosolic activity that augments and a microsomal activity that attenuates the mutagenicity of arylamines. Both activities are modified by ethanol consumption and Aroclor pretreatment.", "label": 0}

In particular, actin organization and myosin-dependent contractility play an important role in the regulation of these functions. Participation of myosin in vectorial transport, expressed as formation of domes, was investigated in confluent monolayers of high transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) plated on non-permeable supports. Cells exposed to 2,3-butanedione monoxime, a selective inhibitor of myosin ATPase, showed a remarkable increase in the number of domes. Replacement of extracellular Na+ and Cl- and inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase blocked the induction of domes. The monoxime also caused a reduction of the TER leading to an increase in the paracellular flux of small molecular weight dextran. However, immunofluorescence microscopy of drug-treated cells showed that the localization and staining pattern of tight junction proteins ZO-1, occludin, and claudin 1, or the actin-myosin ring at the zonula adherens, were not modified. Treatment with the drug produced striking re-arrangements of actin filaments at the microvilli and at the basal level of the cells. Our data show that disruption of actin-myosin interaction at several cellular sites contributed importantly to the increased transport activity and the formation of the domes. These results point to the relevant role or actin-myosin dynamics and actin organization in the regulation of ion and water channel activity in these cells.", "label": 0}

In this time-course study, different concentrations of chlorine, used as NaOCl, were injected into the reactor, the levels of the different forms of residual chlorine were measured, and the numbers of faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci were determined. The results of the kinetics of chlorine consumption showed that monochloramines and trichloramines were the more important forms of residual chlorine as compared to free chlorine and dichloramines. The high contents of trichloramines indicated that the reaction of chlorine with ammoniacal nitrogen was very fast and that the transformation of chlorine into trichloramines was carried out in a time shorter than 1 min. Experimental results showed that the application of the model of Chick-Watson in its original form was not representative of the kinetics of inactivation of faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci. Modification of this model, in considering an initial reduction just at the contact of water with chlorine, improved the results of adjustment of the model. The same findings are valid for the model of Collins-Selleck in considering a value m imposed to the concentration of residual chlorine, since it appeared clearly that the concentration of chlorine influenced the output of disinfection more than did the time of contact.", "label": 1}

Here, we address this issue by performing classical and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (MD) on a complex between the enzyme and a peptide substrate. The classical MD calculation reveals large-scale protein motions involving the flaps and the cantilever. These motions modulate the conformational properties of the substrate at the cleavage site. The ab initio calculations show in turn that substrate motion modulates the activation free energy barrier of the enzymatic reaction dramatically. Thus, the catalytic power of the enzyme does not arise from the presence of a pre-organized active site but from the protein mechanical fluctuations. The implications of this finding for the emergence of drug-resistance are discussed.", "label": 0}

The volume of distribution ranged from 0.490 in rats to 1.68 l kg-1 in mice. Oral bioavailability ranged from 13% in monkeys to 53% in dogs. Predicted human clearance using allometry was 0.0960.649ml min-1 kg-1 and the predicted volume of distribution was 0.766 l kg-1.

A total of 199 patients with diabetes began treatment with magnesium chloride supplementation after enrollment by a specialist. The mean baseline serum magnesium level for patients with IDDM was 1.48 mg/dL and for patients with NIDDM was 1.4 mg/dL (normal range, 1.80 to 2.40 mg/dL). No differences in mean serum magnesium levels were observed between men and women and between those with IDDM and those with NIDDM. Glucose control, as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, did not correlate with magnesium serum levels. A concomitant cardiovascular disease was present in 70% of patients.

For the same UV fluence, viral inactivation observed in the literature varies from 0 to 5 logs according to the models and the methods (infectivity versus molecular biology). The lack of knowledge concerning the mechanisms of inactivation due to UV prevents us from selecting the best model. In this context, determining if viral genome degradation may explain the loss of infectivity under UV radiation becomes essential. Thus, four virus models (PV1 and three F-specific RNA phages: MS2, GA, and Q beta) were exposed to UV radiation from 0 to 150 mJ (.) cm(-2). PVI1 is the least-resistant virus, while MS2 and GA phages are the most resistant, with phage QP having an intermediate sensitivity; respectively, 6-log, 2.3-log, 2.5-log, and 4-log decreases for 50 mJ (.) cm(-2). In parallel, analysis of RNA degradation demonstrated that this phenomenon depends on the fragment size for PV1 as well as for MS2. Long fragments (above 2,000 bases) for PV1 and MS2 fell rapidly to the background level (> 1.3-log decrease) for 20 mJ (.) cm(-2) and 60 mJ (.) cm(-2), respectively. Nevertheless, the size of the viral RNA is not the only factor affecting UV-induced RNA degradation, since viral RNA was more rapidly degraded in PVI than in the MS2 phage with a similar size. Finally, extrapolation of inactivation and UV-induced RNA degradation kinetics highlights that genome degradation could fully explain UV-induced viral inactivation.", "label": 0}

This study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of a liquid prototype produce wash product (Fit), compared with water and chlorinated water, in killing Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 inoculated onto alfalfa seeds. We investigated the efficacy of treatments as influenced by seeds from two different lots obtained from two seeds suppliers and by two methods of inoculation. The efficacy of treatments was influenced by differences in seed lots and amount of organic material in the inoculum. Significant (alpha = 0.05) reductions in Salmonella populations on seeds treated with 20,000 ppm of chlorine or Fit for 30 min ranged from 2.3 to 2.5 log10 CFU/g and 1.7 to 2.3 log10 CFU/g, respectively. Reductions (alpha = 0.05) in E. coli O157:H7 ranged from 2.0 to 2.1 log10 CFU/g and 1.7 to more than 5.4 log10 CFU/g of seeds treated, respectively, with 20,000 ppm of chlorine or Fit. Compared with treatment with 200 ppm of chlorine, treatment with either 20,000 ppm of chlorine or Fit resulted in significantly higher reductions in populations of Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7. None of the treatments eliminated these pathogens as evidenced by their detection on enrichment of treated seeds. Considering the human health and environmental hazards associated with the use of 20,000 ppm of chlorine, Fit provides an effective alternative to chlorine as a treatment to significantly reduce bacterial pathogens that have been associated with alfalfa seeds.", "label": 1}

As an effort to assess this possibility, we assessed the effectiveness of ZVI to remove pathogenic viruses from two water treatment plant samples (from Allentown, PA and Newark, DE) through a series of column experiments. Removal of Aichi virus (AiV), Adenovirus 41 (Ad41), and the bacteriophages MS2 and phi X174 in columns packed with clean sand only and sand with a layer of ZVI-sand mix (1:1, v/v) was examined through pulse tests under saturated flow conditions. With the exception of Ad41, removal of all viruses by sand was zero or limited in all cases, regardless of the water used. In contrast, ZVI-containing columns gave removal efficiencies between 4.5 and 6 logs for all viruses and all waters studied. Ad41 was retained markedly by sand and even more strongly (by 2-3 logs) by ZVI and did not breakthrough fully from either column even after 32 pore volumes. The significant retardation of Ad41 is ascribed to the relatively high isoelectric points of the long and short fibers of Ad41. Our results, combined with studies elsewhere that demonstrate organic matter removal by ZVI and iron oxides, suggest ZVI may potentially offer a simple and low-cost option to help utilities control microorganisms, disinfection byproducts, and chlorine residuals simultaneously. Possible applications of ZVI in water treatment plants are proposed and the potential benefits are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "label": 0}

Antimicrobial 405 nm light is being developed for environmental decontamination within hospitals, however further information relating to its sporicidal efficacy is required. This study aims to establish the efficacy of 405 nm light for inactivation of C. difficile vegetative cells and spores, and to establish whether spore susceptibility can be enhanced by the combined use of 405 nm light with low concentration chlorinated disinfectants. Vegetative cells and spore suspensions were exposed to increasing doses of 405 nm light (at 70-225 mW/cm(2)) to establish sensitivity. A 99.9% reduction in vegetative cell population was demonstrated with a dose of 252 J/cm(2), however spores demonstrated higher resilience, with a 10-fold increase in required dose. Exposures were repeated with spores suspended in the hospital disinfectants sodium hypochlorite, Actichlor and Tristel at non-lethal concentrations (0.1%, 0.001% and 0.0001%, respectively). Enhanced sporicidal activity was achieved when spores were exposed to 405 nm light in the presence of the disinfectants, with a 99.9% reduction achieved following exposure to 33% less light dose than required when exposed to 405 nm light alone. In conclusion, C. difficile vegetative cells and spores can be successfully inactivated using 405 nm light, the sporicidal efficacy can be significantly enhanced when exposed in the presence of low concentration chlorinated disinfectants. Further research may lead to the potential use of 405 nm light decontamination in combination with selected hospital disinfectants to enhance C. difficile cleaning and infection control procedures.", "label": 1}

Yet, the variability and complexity of biological systems pose unique challenges in model building and adjustment. Recent tools from Bayesian statistical inference can be brought together to solve these problems. As an example, the authors modeled the development of biofilm in an industrial pilot drinking-water network. The relationship between chlorine disinfectant, organic carbon, and bacteria concentrations was described by differential equations. Using a Bayesian approach, they derived statistical distributions for the model parameters, on the basis of experimental data. The model was found to adequately fit both prior biological information and the data, particularly at chlorine concentrations between 0.1 and 2 mg/liter. Bacteria were found to have different characteristics in the different parts of the network. The model was used to analyze the effects of various scenarios of water quality at the inlet of the network. The biofilm appears to be very resistant to chlorine and confers a large inertia to the system. Free bacteria are efficiently inactivated by chlorine, particularly at low concentrations of dissolved organic carbon.", "label": 1}

{"id": "2374", "title": "Understanding, Monitoring, and Controlling Biofilm Growth in Drinking Water Distribution Systems", "abstract": "In drinking water distribution systems (DWDS), biofilms are the predominant mode of microbial growth, with the presence of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) protecting the biomass from environmental and shear stresses. Biofilm formation poses a significant problem to the drinking water industry as a potential source of bacterial contamination, including pathogens, and, in many cases, also affecting the taste and odor of drinking water and promoting the corrosion of pipes. This article critically reviews important research findings on biofilm growth in DWDS, examining the factors affecting their formation and characteristics as well as the various technologies to characterize and monitor and, ultimately, to control their growth. Research indicates that temperature fluctuations potentially affect not only the initial bacteria-to-surface attachment but also the growth rates of biofilms. For the latter, the effect is unique for each type of biofilm-forming bacteria; ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, for example, grow more-developed biofilms at a typical summer temperature of 22 degrees C compared to 12 degrees C in fall, and the opposite occurs for the pathogenic Vibrio cholerae. Recent investigations have found the formation of thinner yet denser biofilms under high and turbulent flow regimes of drinking water, in comparison to the more porous and loosely attached biofilms at low flow rates. Furthermore, in addition to the rather well-known tendency of significant biofilm growth on corrosion-prone metal pipes, research efforts also found leaching of growth-promoting organic compounds from the increasingly popular use of polymer-based pipes. Knowledge of the unique microbial members of drinking water biofilms and, importantly, the influence of water characteristics and operational conditions on their growth can be applied to optimize various operational parameters to minimize biofilm accumulation. More-detailed characterizations of the biofilm population size and structure are now feasible with fluorescence microscopy (epifluorescence and CLSM imaging with DNA, RNA, EPS, and protein and lipid stains) and electron microscopy imaging (ESEM). Importantly, thorough identification of microbial fingerprints in drinking water biofilms is achievable with DNA sequencing techniques (the 16S rRNA gene-based identification), which have revealed a prevalence of previously undetected bacterial members. Technologies are now moving toward in situ monitoring of biomass growth in distribution networks, including the development of optical fibers capable of differentiating biomass from chemical deposits. Taken together, management of biofilm growth in water distribution systems requires an integrated approach, starting from the treatment of water prior to entering the networks to the potential implementation of \"biofilm-limiting\" operational conditions and, finally, ending with the careful selection of available technologies for biofilm monitoring and control. For the latter, conventional practices, including chlorine chloramine disinfection, flushing of DWDS, nutrient removal, and emerging technologies are discussed with their associated challenges.", "label": 1}

The outbreak involved 15 orthopaedic patients following metal insertion, and five ophthalmology patients who developed endophthalmitis. Aim An outbreak committee was convened in order to find the cause of the sudden increase in surgical infections. Methods The investigation included epidemiological and patient analyses, and environmental and clinical audits of wards and theatres. Following reports of contaminated surgical sets, surgical instruments and their packaging were examined using a standardized laboratory protocol. Clinical staff visited the sterilization plant. Findings Skin flora including coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Bacillus spp. were recovered from a range of patient specimens. Eleven patients required further surgical attention. Microbiological processing of surgical packs revealed CoNS and Bacillus spp. from inner packaging as well as from instruments themselves. Inspection of the sterilization plant highlighted inadequate maintenance of autoclave components and poor handling practices by staff. This was compounded by lapses in inspection of surgical sets by theatre staff. Cases terminated following a review of operator training, supervision and staffing at the sterilization plant, in conjunction with formal inspection and reporting of damp/stained sets by theatre staff. Conclusions Post-sterilization contamination of sets containing surgical instruments was linked with an increased rate of deep surgical site infections in orthopaedic and ophthalmic patients. The investigation demonstrates the importance of close collaboration and co-operation between sterile services providers, managers and clinical staff and offers guidance for reducing the risk of contaminated sterile surgical instruments.", "label": 0}

The location of cells on or in undamaged and bruised areas of apples that were not washed or rubbed did not differ significantly. However, washing apples resulted in an approximate 2-log reduction in CFU of E. coli O157:H7 per cm(2) of apple surface. On unwashed apples, cells were detected at depths up to 30 mum below the surface. No E. coli O157:H7 cells were detected at locations more than 6 mum below the surface of washed apples.

Short-term chlorine decay kinetics were affected by dose, treatment, and pH. Temp. did not appear to have an effect on chlorine decay in the short term. Dose did not affect the kinetics relative to the long-term chlorine demand. The ratio of long-term chlorine demand to TOC was a useful tool for understanding the effect of treatment on the chlorine reactivity of the remaining natural org. matter (NOM). The application of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics did not appropriately fit the data in the short-term time period for any parameter set.

After each decontamination procedure the bacteria were incapable of proliferation, and showed no evidence of metabolic activity based on the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The use of ultraviolet irradiation or ethyl alcohol solution was comparatively ineffective for sterilisation. Hydrogen peroxide vapour and ultraviolet irradiation, which directly damage nucleic acids, were the most effective methods for removing detectable DNA, which was measured using 16S rRNA gene copy number and fluorescence-based total DNA quantification. Our results have not only been used to tailor the Ellsworth probe decontamination process, but also hold value for subsequent engineering projects, where high standards of decontamination are required.", "label": 0}

In this study, we assessed four isolates representing the major Listeria monocytogenes lineages for their abilities to attach to and grow on Arabidopsis thaliana, a well-characterized plant model. When plants were dipped for 5 min into 3 ml of water containing 8.8 log CFU of L. monocytogenes and rinsed repeatedly, L. monocytogenes was recovered from the leaves at densities from 1.52 to 2.17 log CFU/cm2. Ten days after exposure, bacterial numbers had increased over initial numbers by 2.60\u20132.95 log CFU/cm2. Using L. monocytogenes expressing GFP, bacteria were visualized in the intercellular spaces of A. thaliana leaves, suggesting internalization through stomata. These data indicate that L. monocytogenes can rapidly attach to and multiply on plant surfaces and colonize intercellular spaces in A. thaliana leaves where it may be protected from sanitation treatments. When A. thaliana seeds were exposed to L. monocytogenes, between 4.23 and 4.57 log CFU/cm2 were recovered from leaves 7 days post-germination, suggesting that contaminated seeds can produce contaminated plants. Overall, our study demonstrates that prevention of L. monocytogenes contamination of plants throughout growing stages is critical, consistent with recommendations for other produce-transmitted foodborne pathogens.", "label": 0}

Touch and infectious droplets triggered an increased release of the biocides at the sites of contamination, resulting in rapid disinfection. Zinc chloride (i.e., 30 ppm) was added to provide \"contact-killing\" properties, while bacterial adhesion was prevented by the Pluronic polymer used to encapsulate ClO(2). The new antimicrobial coating is effective against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis , Staphylococcus aureus , and Escherichia coli.

The parenteral administration of antivenom is the mainstay and the only validated treatment of snake bite envenoming. Here, we assess the efficacy of polyspecific anti-Bothrops serum (?-BS) produced in the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS, Peru) and at the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Ezequiel Dias (FUNED, Brazil), to neutralize the main toxic activities induced by five medically-relevant venoms of: Bothrops atrox, B. barnetti, and B.\u00a0pictus from Peru, and the Brazilian B.\u00a0jararaca and B.\u00a0leucurus, all of them inhabiting different geographical locations. Protein electrophoretic patterns of these venoms showed significant differences in composition, number and intensity of bands. Another goal was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lyophilized ?-BS developed at INS to neutralize the detrimental effects of these venoms using in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro assays. The availability of lyophilized ?-BS has relevant significance in its distribution to distant rural communities where the access to antivenom in health facilities is more difficult. Despite the fact that different antigen mixtures were used for immunization during antivenom production, our data showed high toxin-neutralizing activity of ?-BS raised against Bothrops venoms. Moreover, the antivenom cross-reacted even against venoms not included in the immunization mixture. Furthermore, we have evaluated the efficacy of both ?-BS to neutralize key toxic compounds belonging to the predominant protein families of Bothrops snakes. Most significantly, both ?-BS cross-specifically neutralized the main toxicological activities e.g. lethality and hemorrhage induced by these venoms. Thus, our data indicate that both ?-BS are equally effective to treat snake bite victims inflicted by Bothrops snakes particularly B. atrox, responsible for the largest numbers of human envenomations in the Amazon regions of some South American countries including Peru and Brazil.", "label": 0}

Fifty microliters of bacterial suspension was spot inoculated onto the sterile intact fructoplane of whole peaches and plums. Minimum time required for initial adhesion and attachment was recorded for different surface contact times. Surface colonization patterns of the four pathogens and survival under simulated commercial export conditions also were evaluated. L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Typhimurium attached immediately to stone fruit surfaces. E. coli O157:H7 and S. aureus were visibly attached after 30 s and 1 h, respectively, of direct exposure.

This study investigated survival and growth parameters of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, and aerobic mesophilic bacteria transferred from cantaloupe rind surfaces to fresh-cut pieces during fresh-cut preparation. All human bacterial pathogens inoculated on cantaloupe rind surfaces averaged approximately 4.8 log CFU/cm(2), and the populations transferred to fresh-cut pieces before washing treatments ranged from 3 to 3.5 log CFU/g for all pathogens. A nisin-based sanitizer developed in our laboratory and chlorinated water at 1,000 mg/liter were evaluated for effectiveness in minimizing transfer of bacterial populations from cantaloupe rind surface to fresh-cut pieces. Inoculated and uninoculated cantaloupes were washed for 5 min before fresh-cut preparation and storage of fresh-cut pieces at 5 and 10 degrees C for 15 days and at 22 degrees C for 24 h. In fresh-cut pieces from cantaloupe washed with chlorinated water, only Salmonella was found (0.9 log CFU/g), whereas E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes were positive only by enrichment. The nisin-based sanitizer prevented transfer of human bacteria from melon rind surfaces to fresh-cut pieces, and the populations in fresh-cut pieces were below detection even by enrichment. Storage temperature affected survival and the growth rate for each type of bacteria on fresh-cut cantaloupe. Specific growth rates of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, and L. monocytogenes in fresh-cut pieces were similar, whereas the aerobic mesophilic bacteria grew 60 to 80 % faster and had shorter lag phases.", "label": 1}
{"id": "2567", "title": "Mechanisms contributing to hypochlorous acid resistance of a Salmonella isolate from a poultry-processing plant", "abstract": "Aims: We have recently reported the isolation of Salmonella that have acquired tolerance to hypochlorous acid (HOCl) (Mokgatla et al. 1998). The aim of this work was to investigate possible protective mechanisms involved in the increased tolerance to HOCl of a selected resistant strain. Methods and Results: One resistant (Salmonella 104) and one sensitive (Salmonella 81) isolate in exponential phase were exposed to HOCl at a final active concentration of 28 mg l(-1). Cultures were assayed for superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, as well as for four membrane-bound dehydrogenases (malate, lactate, glutamate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). The degree of single-strand breaks in genomic DNA was analysed and lipopolysaccharide, profiles determined. The resistant Salmonella isolate differed from the sensitive isolate in a number of ways. It responded within 10 min of exposure by producing catalase and decreasing the activity levels of four membrane-bound dehydrogenases. This combination would lead to lower levels of hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen, moieties thought to be integrally involved in the antibacterial action of HOCl. Furthermore, the resistant strain did not display the same degree of DNA damage as did the sensitive strain. Conclusions: Strain 104 is believed to grow in the presence of 28 mg l(-1) HOCl by protecting itself against HOCl by decreasing the levels of species that could react with HOCl to generate toxic reactive oxygen radicals and by improved DNA damage repair mechanisms. Significance and Impact of the Study: The occurrence of Salmonella able to grow in the presence of 28 mg l(-1) HOCl is of relevance to the food-processing and drinking water treatment industries as these strains would survive sanitation regimes.", "label": 1}

Several studies have shown that the proportions of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in waters may increase when exposed to low doses of UV light or chlorine. In this study, inactivation of tetracycline-resistant Escherichia coli and antibiotic-sensitive E. coli by UV disinfection and chlorination was compared to determine the tolerance of tetracycline-resistant E. coli to UV light and chlorine, and tetracycline resistance of a tetracycline-resistant E. coli population was studied under different doses of the disinfectants. Our results showed that relative to antibiotic-sensitive E. coli, tetracycline-resistant E. coli had the same tolerance to UV light and a potentially higher tolerance to chlorination. The mortality frequency distributions of tetracycline-resistant E. coli exposed to tetracycline were shifted by both chlorination and UV disinfection. When compared to the hemi-inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of tetracycline-resistant E. coli with no exposure to UV or chlorination, the IC(50) of tetracycline-resistant E. coli treated with tetracycline was 40% lower when inactivation by UV light or chlorination reached 3-log but was 1.18 times greater when inactivation by chlorination reached 4.3-log.

We recently described that GA is also active against both yeast and mammalian prions in an alpha2-adrenergic receptor-independent manner. These data suggest that this side-activity of GA could be explored for the treatment of prion-based diseases and other amyloid-based disorders. In this perspective, the potent antihypertensive activity of GA happens to be an annoying side-effect that could limit its use. In order to get rid of GA agonist activity at alpha2-adrenergic receptors, we performed a structure-activity relationship study around GA based on changes of the chlorine positions on the benzene moiety and then on the modifications of the guanidine group. Hence, we identified the two derivatives 6 and 7 that still possess a potent antiprion activity but were totally devoid of any agonist activity at alpha2-adrenergic receptors. Similarly to GA, 6 and 7 were also able to inhibit the protein folding activity of the ribosome (PFAR) which has been suggested to be involved in prion appearance/maintenance. Therefore, these two GA derivatives are worth being considered as drug candidates.", "label": 0}

The reduction of Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157:H7 at high (4.0 log CFU/g) and low (1.0 log CFU/g) inoculation doses was evaluated at various processing steps, including the following: (i) in trim just after treatment application, (ii) in ground beef just after grinding, (iii) in ground beef 24 h after refrigerated storage, (iv) in ground beef 5 days after refrigerated storage, and (v) in ground beef 30 days after frozen storage. All antimicrobial treatments reduced the pathogens on the trim inoculated with the lower inoculation dose to nondetectable numbers in the trim and in the ground beef. There were significant reductions of both pathogens in the trim and in the ground beef inoculated with the high inoculation doses. On the trim itself, E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium were reduced by 1.5 to 2.0 log cycles, with no differences among all treatments. In the ground beef, the organic acids were more effective in reducing both pathogens than the acidified sodium chlorite immediately after grinding, but after 1 day of storage, there were no differences among treatments. Overall, in the ground beef, there was a 2.5-log reduction of E. coli O157:H7 and a 1.5-log reduction of Salmonella Typhimurium that was sustained over time in refrigerated and frozen storage. Very few sensory differences between the control samples and the treated samples were detected by a consumer panel. Thus, antimicrobial treatments did not cause serious adverse sensory changes. Use of these antimicrobial treatments can be a promising intervention available to ground beef processors who currently have few interventions in their process.", "label": 1}

Because chlorine dioxide does not form chlorinated org. species as a disinfection byproduct, finished water treated with chlorine dioxide generally exhibits substantially lower THM levels than waters receiving treatment with chlorine solns. Treatment with chlorine dioxide allows many utilities to consistently and effectively meet the primary max. contaminant level (PMCL) of 0.10 mg/L for THMs currently mandated by state and federal drinking water regulations. Since the early 1940\u00b0s, chlorine dioxide for drinking water treatment has been produced by conventional wet chem. methods, all of which employ the reaction of aq. sodium chlorite (NaClO2) with chlorine or acid to produce a chlorine dioxide-contg. soln. Newly available technol. employs a controlled reaction of specially-processed solid sodium chlorite with a dil. chlorine-gas blend, to produce chlorine-free (1 percent free chlorine [Cl2]) chlorine dioxide gas. The process effectively eliminates formation of ClO- and ClO3-, which are often produced by traditional ClO2 generation systems or carried through such systems as a result of poor generation efficiency. The 15 million gal/day Spring Hollow water treatment facility, owned and operated by Roanoke County, Virginia, incorporates a \"gas:solid\" ClO2 generation system to produce chlorine dioxide for the pre-oxidn. and pre-disinfection of raw water prior to prodn. of potable drinking water. This is the first full-scale application of the gas:solid technol. for generation of chlorine dioxide in the world. The technol. provides flow-pacing control of the ClO2 feed rate without requiring storage of either chlorine dioxide gas or soln. Infinite turndown capability of the ClO2 generation system allows for dosage adjustments required to meet changing demands or seasonal variations, as well as variable process flow rates encountered during backwashing of filters.

In this research EFW used in germinated brown rice (GBR) production instead of tap water. The effects of the EFW on microbial growth and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content; and the effects of available chlorine concentration (ACC) and presoaking and ultrasonic pretreatment in alkaline electrolyzed water (AlEW) on GABA accumulation during germination were studied. The results showed that presoaking and ultrasonic treatment of brown rice (BR) in AlEW can significantly enhance the antimicrobial activity of acidic electrolyzed water (AEW), resulting in plate count reductions of 2.89 and 3.75 log cfu/g for strong and slightly AEW treatments, respectively, compared with tap water. The AEW achieved better promotion of GBR growth and GABA accumulation than AlEW. A statistical analysis showed that the GABA content was significantly positively correlated with GBR sprout length. The main finding of this study indicates that AEW is effective at reducing the microbial load on BR and enhances the growth and GABA accumulation of GBR. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The evaluation of efficacy was based on establishing noninferiority of a new premilking teat disinfectant compared with an existing premilking teat disinfectant. Approximately 200 cows were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups. Study personnel were blinded as to cow allocation and identification of the premilking disinfectants. Quarters were disinfected using a dip cup before milking with either the control or experimental product. The disinfectant was left on the teat for approximately 30 s before being wiped off in preparation for milking. Quarter-level bacteriological infection status was established at the beginning of the study and quarter milk samples were collected biweekly thereafter. Bacteriological analyses were performed only when somatic cell counts in milk samples crossed a parity-specific threshold. Poisson regression models were used to analyze data. The difference in the rate of new intramammary infections was small and the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of the rate difference was smaller than a predefined noninferiority limit. Based on the observed difference in new intramammary infections rate between the experimental and control product, it was concluded that the experimental disinfectant was not inferior compared with the positive control.

Strawberries were spot inoculated with 7 to 8 log CFU per strawberry of each pathogen (E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes), stored for 1 day at 4 degrees C, and treated at 22 degrees C and 90 to 95% relative humidity with 0.2 to 4.0 mg/liter ClO2 gas for 15 or 30 min using a batch treatment system or with 0.6, 1.8, and 3.0 mg/liter for 10 min using a continuous treatment system. Surviving microbial populations were determined using a membrane-transfer plating recovery method. Increased ClO2 gas concentrations resulted in increased log reductions of each pathogen for both the batch and continuous systems. A batch treatment of strawberries with 4 mg/liter ClO2 for 30 min and continuous treatment with 3 mg/liter ClO2 for 10 min achieved greater than a 5-log reduction for both E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes.

There was no trace of E. coli O157:H7/pGFP in lettuce leaves harvested from noncontaminated nutrient solution (control); however, for plants grown in contaminated nutrient solution, the pathogen was recovered from the leaves disinfected with 80% ethanol and 0.1% mercuric chloride. Most of the lettuce seedlings grown in contaminated nutrient solution tested negative for E. coli O157:H7/pGFP under controlled conditions.

The presence of E. coli O157:H7/pGFP in lettuce leaves is an indication that the pathogen migrated from the contaminated hydroponic system through the roots to the internal locations of lettuce tissue. Due to inaccessibility and limited penetrating power, aqueous chlorine could not eliminate the bacteria localized in the internal tissue. Findings from this study suggest that gamma irradiation was more efficacious than was aqueous chlorine to control internal contamination in hydroponically grown lettuce.

A greater log reduction was observed for the cantaloupe surface tissue with the water, chlorine, and 2% levulinic acid plus 0.2% SDS treatments when additional sanitizer (2 ml) and brushing (to simulate cantaloupes tumbling over brushes on the processing line) were added to the dump tank treatment. The stem scar tissue reductions were 0.90, 1.69, and 1.53 log CFU/g, whereas the netted rind reductions were 1.56, 2.50, and 4.47 log CFU/g after treatment with water, chlorine, and 2% levulinic acid plus 0.2% SDS, respectively. These data suggest that 2% levulinic acid plus 0.2% SDS is effective for reducing Salmonella on the netted rind surface of cantaloupes.

Previous research indicates that pathogen growth and survival is enhanced by leaf damage. The objective of this Study was to compare the behavior of Escherichia coli O157:H7 on damaged leaves of baby Romaine lettuce, spinach, cilantro, and parsley stored at three abusive temperatures (8, 12, and 15 degrees C). The damaged portions of leaves were inoculated with approximately 10(5) CFU E. coli O157:H7 per leaf. The pathogen grew on damaged spinach leaves held for 3 days at 8 and 12 degrees C (P < 0.05), with the population increasing by 1.18 and 2.08 log CFU per leaf, respectively. E. coli O157:H7 did not grow on damaged Romaine leaves at 8 or 12 degrees C, but growth was observed after 8 It of storage at 15 degrees C, with an increase of less than 1.0 log. Growth of E. coli O157:H7 on Romaine lettuce held at 8 or 12 degrees C was enhanced when inocula were suspended in 0.05% ascorbic acid, indicating the possibility of inhibition by oxidation reactions associated with tissue damage. Damaged cilantro and Italian parsley leaves held at 8 degrees C for 4 days did not support the growth of E. coli O157:H7. Behavior of the pathogen in leaf extracts differed from behavior on the damaged tissue. This Study provides evidence that the damaged portion of a leafy green is a distinct growth niche that elicits different microbial responses in the various types of leafy greens.", "label": 0}

METHODS AND RESULTS: Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms were grown on polyvinyl chloride coupons in annular reactors under low nutrient conditions. After biofilm growth, B. cereus spores and polystyrene microspheres (an abiotic control) were introduced separately. Shear stress at the biofilm surface was varied between 0.15 and 1.5 N m(-2). The amount of surrogate pathogens introduced ranged from approximately 10(5) CFU ml(-1) to 10(10 )spheres ml(-1). The quantity of surrogate pathogens integrated in the biofilm was proportional to the amount introduced. In 14 of the 16 cases, 0.4-3.0% of the spores or spheres introduced were measured in the biofilms. The other two cases had 10% and 21% of the spores detected. Data suggested that the spores germinated in the system. The amount of surrogate pathogens detected in the biofilms was higher in the mid-shear range. Chlorine treatment reduced the quantity of both surrogate pathogens and biofilm organisms. In one experiment, the biofilms and B. cereus recovered when the chlorine treatment was terminated. CONCLUSIONS: Planktonic surrogate pathogens can be integrated in biofilms and protected from chlorination decontamination. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This knowledge assists in understanding the impact of biofilms on harbouring potential pathogens in drinking-water systems and protecting the pathogens from decontamination.", "label": 1}

Ultrasound was not enough to inactivate C. sakazakii (0.01-0.58 log-reduction), whereas NaOCl significantly (P < 0.05) reduced C sakazakii (0.58-2.77 log-reduction). Despite the significant reduction in C sakazakii with NaOCl treatment (200 ppm), the combination of 100 min ultrasound and 200 ppm NaOCl resulted in an additional 1.67 log-reduction of C. sakazakii (4.44 log-reduction = 2.77 + 1.67 log). Synergistic reductions on C sakazakii were observed in most combined treatments, although the most synergistic reduction values were <1.0 log(10) CFU/g. The highest synergistic value of reduction in head lettuce was 1.08 log(10) CFU/g when treated with a combination of 100 min ultrasound and 200 ppm NaOCl. Moreover, the pH and degrees Brix after combined treatment with 5-100 min ultrasound and 50-200 ppm NaOCl did not significantly differ from any single treated lettuce. These results indicate that combined treatment with 100 min ultrasound and 200 ppm NaOCl could be a potential approach to reduce C sakazakii on post-harvest leaf vegetable during processing and enhance the shelf-life during distribution and storage.

{"id": "4735", "title": "Application of water-assisted ultraviolet light in combination of chlorine and hydrogen peroxide to inactivate Salmonella on fresh produce", "abstract": "With the demand for fresh produce increases in recent decades, concerns for microbiological safety of fresh produce are also raised. To identify effective ultraviolet (UV) light treatment for fresh produce decontamination, we first determined the effect of three forms of UV treatment, dry UV (samples were treated by UV directly), wet UV (samples were dipped in water briefly and then exposed to UV), and water-assisted UV (samples were treated by UV while being immersed in agitated water) on inactivation of Salmonella inoculated on tomatoes and fresh-cut lettuce. In general, the water-assisted UV treatment was found to be the most effective for both produce items. Chlorine and hydrogen peroxide were then tested to determine whether they could be used to enhance the decontamination efficacy of water-assisted UV treatment and prevent transfer of Salmonella via wash water by completely eliminating it. Neither of them significantly enhanced water-assisted UV inactivation of Salmonella on tomatoes. Chlorine significantly improved the decontamination effectiveness of the water-assisted UV treatment for baby-cut carrots and lettuce, but not for spinach. In general, the single water-assisted UV treatment and the combined treatment of water-assisted UV and chlorine were similar or more effective than the chlorine washing treatment. In most of the cases, no Salmonella was detected in the wash water when the single water-assisted UV treatment was used to decontaminate tomatoes. In a few cases when Salmonella was detected in the wash water, the populations were very low,</=2CFU/mL, and the wash water contained an extremely high level of organic load and soil level. Therefore, the single water-assisted UV treatment could potentially be used as an environmentally friendly and non-chemical alternative to chlorine washing for tomatoes after validation in industrial scale. For lettuce, spinach and baby-cut carrots, the combined treatment of water-assisted UV treatment and chlorine was needed to maintain a pathogen free environment in the wash water so that cross contamination could be prevented during fresh produce washing.", "label": 1}

Samples were treated with SC-CO2 at 10, 15, or 20 MPa and temperatures of 35, 40, or 45 \u00b0C for 5, 10, or 15 min. The germination percentage was measured after three days of germination. Generally, treating seeds with SC-CO2 at higher pressures, temperatures, or for longer treatment times resulted in greater microbial reductions than treatments at lower pressures, temperatures, or for shorter treatment times. SC-CO2 treatment clearly reduced the microorganism levels in alfalfa seeds; in particular, treatment at 20 MPa and 45 \u00b0C for 15 min reduced levels of the three pathogens by &gt; 7.0 log colony forming units (CFU)/g. However, SC-CO2 treatment at a high pressure and high temperature, especially treatment at 20 MPa and 40 or 45 \u00b0C, impaired the seed germination capability in some cases. Without impairing the germination capability, the maximum reduction level of E. coli O157:H7 was 3.51 CFU/g with SC-CO2 treatment at 15 MPa and 35 \u00b0C for 10 min. Maximum reductions of L. monocytogenes and S. typhimurium were 2.65 and 2.48 log CFU/g, respectively, with treatment at 10 MPa and 45 \u00b0C for 5 min.

Determining the pharmacokinetic parameters of drug candidates at an early stage of development requires an inexpensive animal model with few associated ethical issues. In this study, we used the silkworm infection model to perform structure-activity relationship studies of an antimicrobial agent, GPI0039, a novel nitrofuran dichloro-benzyl ester, and successfully identified compound 5, a nitrothiophene dichloro-benzyl ester, as a potent antimicrobial agent with superior therapeutic activity in the silkworm infection model. Further, we compared the pharmacokinetic parameters of compound 5 with a nitrothiophene benzyl ester lacking chlorine, compound 7, that exerted similar antimicrobial activity but had less therapeutic activity in silkworms, and examined the metabolism of these antimicrobial agents in human liver fractions in vitro. Compound 5 had appropriate pharmacokinetic parameters, such as an adequate half-life, slow clearance, large area under the curve, low volume of distribution, and long mean residence time, compared with compound 7, and was slowly metabolized by human liver fractions. These findings suggest that the therapeutic effectiveness of an antimicrobial agent in the silkworms reflects appropriate pharmacokinetic properties.", "label": 0}

This study was undertaken to determine whether decontaminants might give a competitive advantage to pathogenic bacteria on poultry and involve a potential risk to consumer. A total of 144 chicken legs were co-inoculated with similar concentrations of pathogenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis or Escherichia coli) and spoilage bacteria (Brochothrix thermosphacta or Pseudomonas fluorescens). Samples were dipped for 15min in solutions (w/v) of trisodium phosphate (12%; TSP), acidified sodium chlorite (1200ppm; ASC), citric acid (2%; CA), peroxyacids (220ppm; PA) or chlorine dioxide (50ppm; CD), or were left untreated (control). Microbiological analyses were carried out on day 0 and every 24h until day 7 of storage (at 10+/-1 degrees C). The modified Gompertz equation was used as the primary model to fit observed data. TSP, ASC and CA were effective in extending the lag phase (L, ranging from 1.47+/-1.34days to 4.06+/-1.16days) and in decreasing the concentration of bacteria during the stationary phase (D, ranging from 2.46+/-0.51 log(10) cfu/cm(2) to 8.64+/-0.53 log(10) cfu/cm(2)), relative to the control samples (L values ranging from 0.59+/-0.38days and 2.52+/-2.28days, and D values ranging from 6.32+/-0.89 log(10) cfu/cm(2) to 9.39+/-0.39 log(10) cfu/cm(2), respectively). Both on untreated and on most decontaminated samples the overgrowth of spoilage bacteria among the species tested was observed throughout storage, suggesting that spoilage would occur prior to any noteworthy increase in the levels of pathogenic microorganisms. However, L. monocytogenes counts similar to, or higher than, those for spoilage bacteria were observed on samples treated with TSP, ASC or CA, suggesting that these treatments might pose a danger to consumers. However, these results derive from laboratory-based experiments testing artificially-inoculated bacteria. Further investigations of the natural micro-biota of poultry carcasses would be appropriate in order to substantiate these findings.", "label": 0}

In comparison to direct chlorination, the EC process displayed a much stronger disinfecting capability than that of electrochlorination assumed for EC disinfection. Observations with scanning electron microscopy on the E. coli bacteria of wastewater treated by different means of disinfection suggested that the cells were likely killed during the EC treatment by chemical products with oxidizing and germicidal powers similar to that of ozone and much stronger than that of chlorine.

Conventional water quality monitoring programmes are not always able to detect a microbial contamination of drinking water. In the drinking water production chain, in addition to the vulnerability of source waters, the distribution networks are prone to contamination. In this study, a pilot-scale drinking-water distribution network with an on-line monitoring system was utilized for detecting bacterial intrusion. During the experimental Escherichia coli intrusions, the contaminant was measured by applying a set of on-line sensors for electric conductivity (EC), pH, temperature (T), turbidity, UV-absorbance at 254\u00a0nm (UVAS SC) and with a device for particle counting. Monitored parameters were compared with the measured E.\u00a0coli counts using the integral calculations of the detected peaks. EC measurement gave the strongest signal compared with the measured baseline during the E.\u00a0coli intrusion. Integral calculations showed that the peaks in the EC, pH, T, turbidity and UVAS SC data were detected corresponding to the time predicted. However, the pH and temperature peaks detected were barely above the measured baseline and could easily be mixed with the background noise. The results indicate that on-line monitoring can be utilized for the rapid detection of microbial contaminants in the drinking water distribution system although the peak interpretation has to be performed carefully to avoid being mixed up with normal variations in the measurement data.", "label": 1}

Metabolic activity (using the AlamarBlue dye) assays were performed to assess the residual activity of the microbial cells after the disinfection treatments along with culture-based methods. A faster inactivation rate of 1.52 log min(-1) and inactivation of 7.62 log(10) was observed within 5min of ultrasound exposure. Ultrasound treated cells repaired by 1.4 log(10) in contrast to 5.3 log(10) repair for UV-C treated cells. Ultrasound treatment significantly lowered the reactivation of Aeromonas hydrophila in comparison to UV-C- and UV-C-induced photocatalysis. Ultrasound appeared to be an effective means of inactivating Aeromonas hydrophila and could be used as a potential disinfection method for water and wastewater reuse.", "label": 0}

For this purpose, DIN 19643 \"Treatment of Water of Swimming Pools and Baths\" applies in Germany. To date, this std. has prescribed the chlorination of water. In a therapeutic pool introduced here, water was treated without chlorine. The water quality was obsd. as part of a long-term study over the course of three years. During the entire period, no germs were detected in the filtrate of the system, not even unspecific CFU germs. The treatment presented here is detailed from both theor. and practical viewpoints. The treatment uses the oxidn. power of ozone to form hypobromous acid as a disinfectant in water contg. bromide. A crucial aspect of the treatment is the possible formation of bromate. It is shown that the formation of bromate can be suppressed very effectively. Further bromine-based byproducts were monitored. Unpleasant byproducts as known from the chlorination were not found. The treatment, known as ozone-bromine Treatment, demonstrates new ways to treat water in public swimming pools and should now be incorporated into the German DIN 19643. It is to be expected that this will also be reflected in the national stds. of other countries. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

Slicers used in delis have many removable parts that are connected with seals and gaskets, with spaces, cracks and crevices that are difficult to clean adequately and may provide a niche for L. monocytogenes survival. Standard cleaning and sanitizing practices used by deli employees may not eliminate Listeria in these niches. Moist heat is known to be more effective against L. monocytogenes than dry heat at the same temperature and time. The study reported here investigated the effects of moist heat combined with quaternary ammonium compounds (5 or 10 ppm), chlorine (10 or 25 ppm) or peracetic acid (10 or 25 ppm) on inactivating L. monocytogenes attached to stainless steel or aluminum coupons cut from commercial deli meat slicer components. All sanitizers when used alone resulted in a 2- to 3-log reduction of L. monocytogenes on stainless steel or aluminum surfaces, while moist heat alone resulted in a 3- to 4-log reduction. When combined with heat the quaternary ammonium was used at 5 ppm, peracetic acid at 10 ppm and chlorine at 10 ppm. When the 2 lethal treatments were combined there was a 5- to7-log reduction as compared to initial inoculation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The results of this study will provide a better understanding and potential methods for the sanitization of industrial deli meat slicers. In turn, the knowledge gained from this study can reduce the risk of contamination and outbreaks of L. monocytogenes and other food-borne pathogens for consumers.", "label": 1}
{"id": "4076", "title": "Inactivation of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts with ozone and free chlorine", "abstract": "The objective of this study is to investigate the synergy involved in the sequential inactivation of C. parvum oocysts with ozone followed by free chlorine at 1-20 degrees C. Primary ozone and free chlorine inactivation curves are characterized by an initial lag-phase, followed by one or two post-lag-phase segments, the first segment at a faster rate than the second, of pseudo-first-order inactivation. The kinetics of primary inactivation with ozone and free chlorine has a relatively strong temperature dependence, and vary both with oocyst lot and oocyst age. Synergy is observed for the sequential inactivation of C. parvum oocysts with ozone/free chlorine. Ozone pre-treatment results in the disappearance of the lag-phase and the occurrence of a secondary free chlorine inactivation curve with generally two pseudo-first-order segments, the first segment at a faster rate than the second. The kinetics of both secondary segments is significantly faster than the post-lag-phase rate of inactivation with free chlorine alone. The temperature dependence for both phases of the secondary free chlorine inactivation kinetics is weaker compared to that for primary inactivation with ozone or free chlorine. As a result, the level of synergy in sequential disinfection with ozone/free chlorine increases with decreasing temperature within the range relevant to drinking water utilities. Good agreement is found between the kinetics determined using the modified in-vitro excystation method of viability assessment and animal infectivity data recently reported in the literature for both primary inactivation with ozone, and sequential disinfection with ozone/free chlorine.", "label": 0}

Water treatment with electrolysis was performed in a specially made electrolytic cell consisting of TinO2n-1 contg. ceramic anode and Escherichia coli was used as a model organism for disinfection expts. The influence of the sulfate ion and buffer soln. on the disinfection process and distributed chlorine variation after electrolysis, the influence of the electrolysis process current intensity and duration time on the disinfection processes, and changes of the extd. chlorine in electrolysis process were investigated. Cell viability was detd. by cultivation on culture media, by modified Direct Viable Count (DVC) method combined with Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and cell activity was detd. by staining with redox dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC). Results showed that the effect of sulfate ions on viability of E. coli is minor. A minor decrease in cultivability and potential for dividing were obsd. only in samples without sulfate ions or in samples with low sulfate ion concn. To test the formation of active chorine from chlorine ions, KCl salt in concns. similar to those in drinking water was added to water. The soln. was electrolyzed using permanent process parameters (I-0.1 A, pH 7 \u00b1 0.2, t\u00b0 = 25\u00b0C, t = 15 min) while stirring intensively. It can be concluded that at even relatively low energy input (0.5-2.5 kWh/m3, depending on water cond.) in water samples below 50 mg/L of chlorine TinO2n-1 ceramic electrodes generated active chlorine in the range of 0.5-3.5 mgCl2/L, which is the level of chorine used for drinking water disinfection. The results also confirmed that disinfection effect is a result of generation of oxidant species from chlorine rather than effect of electricity per se, formation of radicals in water. Results clearly showed that at level of chlorine ions concn. about 7 mg/L E. coli is not culturable, not respiring and not able to divide. Results showed that increase of current above 0.02 A at chlorine ion concn. of 6.8 mg/L was sufficient to inactivate both culturable and VBNC E. coli. Notably, the ability to divide (DVC pos.) was lost more rapidly than the ability to respire Kinetics of disinfection was studied in water sample which was treated with 0. 02 A at chlorine ion concn. of 6.8 mg/L. After about 15 min of exposure no culturable or able-to-divide E. coli was detected in the sample. Respiration ability of E. coli decreased with different trend: more rapidly at the beginning and nearly stopped after 3 min of test. This phenomenon should be investigated further. Using the TinO2n-1 electrode in the electrolysis process with the presence of chloride ions, in concn. range which is common in raw waters a level of active chlorine can be created that kills more than 99% of E. coli within 15 min.

The present study investigated the potential application of bacteriophage (or phage) phSE-2, phage phSE-5 and phage cocktail phSE-2/phSE-5 to decrease the concentration of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium) during the depuration of natural and artificially contaminated cockles (Cerastoderma edule). Cockles were artificially infected with 105 and 106 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of S. Typhimurium in static seawater and infected group were treated with phages at four different MOI values: 0.1, 1, 10 and 100. Depuration in static seawater at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 with single phage suspensions of phSE-2 and phSE-5 provided the best results, as it decreased by ~ 1.3 and 1.7 log CFU/g, respectively, the concentration of Salmonella spp. after a 4 h treatment. At a MOI of 0.1, the rate of inactivation with single phage suspensions was higher when compared with the results obtained using the phage cocktail. However, in naturally contaminated cockles treated in static seawater with single phage suspensions and phage cocktail phSE-2/phSE-5, similar decreases in cultivable bacteria concentration (~ 0.7\u20130.9 log CFU/g) were achieved after 6 h of treatment. When artificially contaminated cockles were depurated with phage phSE-5 in a recirculated seawater system (mimicking industrial depuration conditions), a 0.9 and 2.0 log CFU/g reduction of Salmonella spp. was reached after 4 and 6 h treatment. Once the depuration process was performed without phage, a 6 h treatment was needed to obtain a 1.1 log CFU/g reduction of Salmonella spp. Results indicated that combining phage biocontrol with depuration procedures enhance bivalve microbial safety for human consumption by improving decontamination efficiency, proving that this technology can be transposed to the bivalves industry. Moreover, this approach also displays the advantage of reducing the time required for depuration and consequently its associated costs.", "label": 0}

Faster color removal was obtained by photoelectrocatalytic oxidation in 0.1 mol L(-1) NaCl pH 4.0 under UV light and an applied potential of +1.0V (vs SCE reference electrode), which indicates also values around 60% of TOC removal. The conventional chlorination method and electrochemical oxidation on Pt electrode resulted in negligible reduction of TOC removal. All dyes showed positive mutagenic activity in the Salmonella/microsome assay with the strain TA98 in the absence and presence of S9 (exogenous metabolic activation). Nevertheless, there is complete reduction of the mutagenic activity after 1 h of photoelectrocatalytic oxidation, suggesting that this process would be good option to remove disperse azo dyes from aqueous media.

Biofilm samples were collected from the designed system at different biofilm ages (10, 40 and 90 hours old) and enumerated. The results indicated that the biofilm formation occurred on all plumbing materials with Cu and R as exceptions. The intensity of biofilm formation was found to be maximum on PVC followed by PP and PE. We also demonstrated the chemical chromophore (Calcofluor) successfully for rapid and easy visual detection of biofilms, validated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of the plumbing materials.

The structural modifications made to the basic quinolone and naphthyridone nucleus and to the side chains have allowed improvements to be made such that the next group of fluoroquinolones after norfloxacin, exemplified by ciprofloxacin, had high activity against Gram-negative species and a number of atypical pathogens, good-to-moderate activity against Gram-positive species and were well absorbed and distributed. These compounds have been successfully used in the clinic for a decade and the size of the market has risen in recent years to only a little less than that for penicillins and macrolides. Notwithstanding the broad spectrum of these compounds, defects became evident. The growth in understanding of structure\u2013activity relationships with fluoroquinolones has enabled the development of even better compounds. The targets in fluoroquinolone research during the last few years include: improvements in pharmacokinetic properties, greater activity against Gram-positive cocci and anaerobes, activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, and improvements in activity against non-fermentative Gram-negative species. The compounds developed in the recent years have fulfilled some but not all of these goals; improved bioavailability is one target achieved with most of the more recent compounds allowing for once-daily dosing. Gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin have all greatly improved the activity against Gram-positive cocci, particularly pneumococci, and against anaerobes. They are not quite as active as ciprofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, and show no substantial improvements in activity against non-fermentative species. Clinafloxacin, gemifloxacin and sitafloxacin have even better activity against Gram-positive cocci and are as active as ciprofloxacin against most Gram-negatives, though gemifloxacin is less active than the other new compounds against Gram-negative anaerobes. These three compounds do retain some activity against a number of ciprofloxacin-resistant species (Gram-positive and Gram-negative), but whether this activity will be adequate for clinical use is at present unclear. Both clinafloxacin and sitafloxacin contain a chloro substituent at position 8 of the quinolone nucleus. A halogen at this position in a number of compounds, though giving good activity, has also been associated with phototoxicity. Several fluoroquinolones have had to be withdrawn or strictly limited in their use post-marketing and in some cases no obvious relationship can be seen between the adverse effects and structural features, making this an area for urgent research.", "label": 0}

Cutting may increase microbial spoilage of fruits through transfer of microflora on the outer surfaces to the interior tissue. The objectives of this study were to use the vacuum-steam-vacuum (VSV) process to reduce indigenous spoilage microflora on the surface of cantaloupes and to investigate the effects of such treatments on transfer of spoilage microflora from the cantaloupe surface to the fresh-cut melon during rind removal and cutting. Whole cantaloupes were treated in the VSV processor, and fresh-cut pieces prepared from treated and control samples were stored at 5 and 10 degrees C for up to 9 days. Presence and growth of mesophilic bacteria, yeasts and molds, and Pseudomonas spp. were determined in fresh-cut samples during storage. Texture and color (CIE L*, a*, and b*) also were measured during storage. VSV treatment resulted in a 1.0-log reduction of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, a 2.0-log reduction of yeasts and molds, and a 1.5-log reduction of Pseudotnonas spp. on cantaloupe surfaces. VSV treatment significantly reduced transfer of yeasts and molds and Pseudomonas spp. from whole cantaloupe surface to fresh-cut pieces during preparation (P < 0.05). Texture and color of the freshcut pieces prepared from the VSV-treated whole melons were similar to those of the controls. The results of this study indicate that the use of the VSV process to reduce the surface populations of yeasts and molds and Pseudomonas spp. on whole cantaloupes will reduce subsequent transfer of these microbes to fresh-cut pieces and enhance the microbial quality of the fresh-cut product.", "label": 0}

The aims of this study were to further evaluate the genotoxic potential of the world wide used disinfectants sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide in human leukocytes by the Comet assay and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain D7 (mitotic gene conversion, point mutation and mitochondrial DNA mutability, with and without endogenous metabolic activation) and to compare their effects with those of peracetic acid, proposed as an alternative disinfectant. All three disinfectants are weakly genotoxic in human leukocytes (lowest effective dose 0.2 p.p.m. for chlorine dioxide, 0.5 p.p.m. for sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid). The results in S.cerevisiae show a genotoxic response on the end-points considered with an effect only at doses higher (5- to 10-fold) than the concentration normally used for water disinfection; sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid are able to induce genotoxic effects without endogenous metabolic activation (in stationary phase cells) whereas chlorine dioxide is effective in growing cells. The Comet assay was more sensitive than the yeast tests, with effective doses in the range normally used for water disinfection processes. The biological effectiveness of the three disinfectants on S.cerevisiae proved to be strictly dependent on cell-specific physiological/biochemical conditions.

Induction of abnormal chromosomal arrangements in mitosis were found to be favoured by o-chlorine substitutions, but not by co-planarity giving affinity, for example, for the Ah receptor and CYP1A isoenzymes. Only 2,2',5,5'-tetrachloro- and 2,3,3',4,4'-pentachlorobiphenyl gave dose-response curves similar to many other compounds tested in vitro, showing an increase from the background level of 10 to 100% disturbed mitoses with nominal concentrations >10(-6) M, i.e, concentrations far above the total PCB concentrations found in human blood. Cells transfected with rat CYP2B1 were more sensitive to the most active congener, 2,3',4,4'-pentachlorobiphenyl, than cells lacking P450 activity or expressing CYP1A1, Induction of abnormal mitosis by PCB metabolites formed by P450 enzymes cannot be excluded, but does not seem likely because of the short treatment time and the reportedly slow metabolism of PCBs, 2,3,3',4,4'-Pentachlorobiphenyl showed synergistic activity with the potent spindle poison triphenyltin. Inactive concentrations of both agents (10 and 50 nM, respectively) caused abnormal configurations when combined. This is an important finding since exposure to mixtures of compounds is common and it motivates further studies of subthreshold activities of highly lipophilic environmental contaminants.", "label": 0}

{"id": "3711", "title": "Targeting the gyrase of Plasmodium falciparum with topoisomerase poisons", "abstract": "Drug-resistant malaria poses a major public health problem throughout the world and the need for new antimalarial drugs is growing. The apicoplast, a chloroplast-like organelle essential for malaria parasite survival and with no counterpart in humans, offers an attractive target for selectively toxic new therapies. The apicoplast genome (plDNA) is a 35 kb circular DNA that is served by gyrase, a prokaryotic type II topoisomerase. Gyrase is poisoned by fluoroquinolone antibacterials that stabilize a catalytically inert ternary complex of enzyme, its plDNA substrate, and inhibitor. We used fluoroquinolones to study the gyrase and plDNA of Plasmodium falciparum. New methods for isolating and separating plDNA reveal four topologically different forms and permit a quantitative exam of perturbations that result from gyrase poisoning. In keeping with its role in DNA replication, gyrase is most abundant in late stages of the parasite lifecycle, but several lines of evidence indicate that even in these cells the enzyme is present in relatively low abundance: about 1 enzyme for every two plDNAs or a ratio of 1 gyrase: 70 kb DNA. For a spectrum of quinolones, correlation was generally good between antimalarial activity and gyrase poisoning, the putative molecular mechanism of drug action. However, in P. falciparum there is evidence for off-target toxicity, particularly for ciprofloxacin. These studies highlight the utility of the new methods and of fluoroquinolones as a tool for studying the in situ workings of gyrase and its plDNA substrate.", "label": 0}

Objectives In order to get insight into the local circulation of this virus after four years of the official introduction of the vaccine, the aims of this study were to provide information on HAV immune status of the adult population of C\u00f3rdoba city and to conduct environmental surveillance of HAV in sewage and river samples in the same region. Study design The prevalence of anti-HAV was determined by EIA in 416 samples of people (without prior vaccination) from C\u00f3rdoba city (2009\u20132010). Spline regression models were estimated under generalized additive models. Environmental surveillance was conducted in river and sewage samples collected in the same period. Viral detection was performed by RT-Nested PCR of the 5?UTR. Results In C\u00f3rdoba, the global prevalence of anti-HAV was 73.5%. It increased with age (p &lt; 0.0001) and it was associated with the low-income population (OR: 1.14; 95% CI 1.05\u20131.25). This prevalence decreased in younger age groups, especially in the high-income population. Environmental monitoring revealed the presence of HAV (IA) in 20.8% and 16.1% of wastewater and river samples, respectively. Conclusions As a consequence of a decrease in HAV circulation due to improvements in immunization, socio-economic and hygienic conditions, young adults are becoming increasingly susceptible to HAV infections. Environmental monitoring demonstrated that HAV circulates in the local population; therefore, health care systems should consider the implementation of preventive measures for susceptible adults in order to reduce the risk of HAV infection.", "label": 0}
{"id": "2947", "title": "Evidence for a second binding/transport site for chloride in erythrocyte anion transporter AE1 modified at glutamate 681", "abstract": "Transport kinetics have been examined in erythrocyte anion transporter AE1 that has been chemically modified to convert glutamate 681 to an alcohol (E681OH AE1). Outward conductive Cl(-) flux in E681OH AE1 is inhibited by removal of extracellular Cl(-); this effect is the opposite of that in native AE1 and is consistent with coupled electrogenic 2:1 Cl(-)/Cl(-) exchange. A second Cl(-) binding/transport site is also suggested by the characteristics of (35)SO(4)(2-) flux in E681OH AE1: bilateral and cis Cl(-), which are normally inhibitory, accelerate (35)SO(4)(2-) flux. These effects would be expected if Cl(-) binds to a second transport site on SO(4)(2-)-loaded E681OH AE1, thereby allowing Cl(-)/SO(4)(2-) cotransport. Alternatively, the data can be explained without proposing Cl(-)/SO(4)(2-) cotransport if the rate-limiting event for (35)SO(4)(2-)/SO(4)(2-) exchange is external SO(4)(2-) release, and the binding of external Cl(-) accelerates SO(4)(2-) release. With either interpretation, these data indicate that E681OH AE1 has a binding/transport site for Cl(-) that is distinct from the main transport site. The effects of graded modification of E681 or inhibition by H(2)DIDS are consistent with the idea that the new Cl(-) binding site is on the same E681OH-modified subunit of the AE1 dimer as the normal transport site.", "label": 0}

Using a porcine gastric mucin-magnetic bead (PGM-MB) assay, no statistically significant loss in HuNoV binding (inactivation) was observed for secondary effluent treatments of </=25 ppm total chlorine; for both strains, 50 and 100 ppm treatments resulted in </=0.8-log10 unit and >/=3.9-log10 unit reductions, respectively. Treatments of 10, 25, 50, and 100 ppm chlorine inactivated 0.31, 1.35, >5, and >5 log10 units, respectively, of the norovirus indicator MS2 bacteriophage. Evaluation of treatment time indicated that the vast majority of MS2 and HuNoV inactivation occurred in the first 5 min for 0.2-mum-filtered, prechlorinated secondary effluent. Free chlorine measurements of secondary effluent seeded with MS2 and HuNoV demonstrated substantial oxidative burdens. With 25, 50, and 100 ppm treatments, free chlorine levels after 5 min of exposure ranged from 0.21 to 0.58 ppm, from 0.28 to 16.7 ppm, and from 11.6 to 53 ppm, respectively. At chlorine treatment levels of >50 ppm, statistically significant differences were observed between reductions for PGM-MB-bound HuNoV (potentially infectious) particles and those for unbound (noninfectious) HuNoV particles or total norovirus particles. While results suggested that MS2 and HuNoV (measured as PGM-MB binding) behave similarly, although not identically, both have limited susceptibility to chlorine treatments of </=25 ppm total chlorine. Since sewage treatment is performed at </=25 ppm total chlorine, targeting free chlorine levels of 0.5 to 1.0 ppm, these results suggest that traditional chlorine-based sewage treatment does not inactivate HuNoV efficiently.IMPORTANCE HuNoV is ubiquitous in sewage. A receptor binding assay was used to assess inactivation of HuNoV by chlorine-based sewage treatment, given that the virus cannot be routinely propagated in vitro Results reported here indicate that chlorine treatment of sewage is not effective for inactivating HuNoV unless chlorine levels are above those routinely used for sewage treatment.", "label": 1}

Radish shreds have a short shelf life thus necessitating the use of chemical additives. However, demand for natural preservatives in foods has increased. Chitosan is a natural antimicrobial biopolymer with a good film forming ability. Hence, it is used as an edible coating on whole and fresh cut fruits and vegetables. The present investigation explored powder coating technique using purified chitosan and chitosan lactate for shelf life extension of shredded radish. Macro perforated LDPE resealable pouches were used to pack the samples. Samples were stored at 10 \u00b0C for 10 d. Physicochemical characteristics, phytochemicals, antioxidant activity, respiration rate and color were analyzed periodically. The study also determined microbial load and sensory acceptability in the stored samples. Chitosan treated samples exhibited a lower degree of weight loss, respiration rate, titrable acidity, % soluble solids and higher content of phytochemicals, moisture, and pH compared with control samples. The treated samples also exhibited better sensory acceptability, lower exudate volume, lesser browning and lower microbial load compared to control. This indicated better potential marketability of the coated radish shreds. Chitosan powder coating could be used as an efficient technique for quality maintenance and shelf life extension of radish shreds with feasibility for large scale application.", "label": 0}

Changes in the biofilms with ageing, disinfection, and phosphate treatment were monitored using fluorescence in situ hybridization. EUB338, BET42a, GAM42a, and ALF1b probes were used to target most bacteria and the alpha (alpha), beta (beta), and gamma (gamma) subclasses of Proteobacteria, respectively. The stability of biofilm composition was checked after the onset of colonization between T = 42 days and T = 113 days. From 56.0% to 75.9% of the cells detected through total direct counts with DAPI (4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) were also detected with the EUB338 probe, which targets the 16S rRNA of most bacteria. Among these cells, 16.9%-24.7% were targeted with the BET42a probe, 1.8%-18.3% with the ALF1b probe, and <2.5% with the GAM42a probe. Phosphate treatment induced a significant enhancement to the proportion of gamma-Proteobacteria (detected with the GAM42a probe), a group that contains many health-related bacteria. Disinfection with monochloramine for 1 month or chlorine for 3 days induced a reduction in the percentage of DAPI-stained cells that hybridized with the EUB338 probe (as expressed by percentages of EUB338 counts/DAPI) and with any of the ALF1b, BET42a, and GAM42a probes. The percentage of cells detected by any of the three probes (ALF1b+BET42a+GAM42a) tended to decrease, and reached in total less than 30% of the EUB338-hybridized cells. Disinfection with chlorine for 7 days induced a reverse shift; an increase in the percentage of EUB338 counts targeted by any of these three probes was noted, which reached up to 87%. However, it should be noted that the global bacterial densities (heterotrophic plate counts and total direct counts) tended to decrease over the duration of the experiment. Therefore, those bacteria that could be considered to resist 7 days of chlorination constituted a small part of the initial biofilm community, up to the point at which the other bacterial groups were destroyed by chlorination. The results suggest that there were variations in the kinetics of inactivation by disinfectant, depending on the bacterial populations involved.[on SciFinder (R)]", "label": 1}

The cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of the halogenated propane 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP) has previously been studied in our laboratories. These studies showed that metabolic activation of DBCP was required to exert its detrimental effects. All of the trihalogenated propane analogues were mutagenic when the microsomal activation system was included. The highest mutagenic activity was obtained with 1,2,3-tribromopropane, with approximately 50-fold higher activity than the least mutagenic trihalogenated propane, 1,2,3-trichloropropane. The order of mutagenicity was as follows: 1,2,3-tribromopropane greater than or equal to 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane > 1,3-dibromo-2-chloropropane greater than or equal to 1,3-dichloro-2-bromopropane >> 1-bromo-2,3-dichloropropane > 1,2,3-trichloropropane. Compared to DBCP, the dihalogenated propanes were substantially less mutagenic. Only 1,2-dibromopropane was mutagenic and its mutagenic potential was approximately 1/30 of that of DBCP. In contrast to DBCP, l,2-dibromopropane showed similar mutagenic activity with and without the addition of an activation system. The halogenated propenes 2,3-dibromopropene and 2-bromo-3-chloropropene were mutagenic to the bacteria both in the absence and presence of the activation system, whereas 2,3-dichloropropene did not show any mutagenic effect. The large differences in mutagenic potential between the various halogenated propanes and propenes are proposed to be due to the formation of different possible proximate and ultimate mutagenic metabolites resulting from the microsomal metabolism of the various halogenated propanes and propenes, and to differences in the rate of formation of the metabolites. Pathways are proposed for the formation of genotoxic metabolites of di- and trihalogenated propanes and dihalogenated propenes.", "label": 0}

Circulating the gas through the plasma reactor was found to be beneficial for decontamination. The experiments confirmed the important contribution of humidity on the inactivation effect, as a consequence of hydroxyl radicals formation. The best results were obtained for a relative humidity of 80%, where Salmonella population on egg surface was reduced below the detection limit (102\u00a0cells per egg) after 10\u00a0min of direct treatment and 25\u00a0min indirect treatment.", "label": 0}

Raw wastewater and treated samples were analyzed using stir-bar sorptive extn. coupled with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatog. (SBSE-CG \u00d7 GC-TOF-MS). Ozone treatment could remove most pollutants with a global efficiency of over 95% for 209 ?M ozone dosage. UV irradn. reduced the total concn. of the sixteen pollutants tested by an av. of 63% with high removal of the sunscreen 2-ethylhexyl trans-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC), the synthetic musk 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyltetrahydronaphthalene (tonalide, AHTN) and several herbicides. Visible light Ce-TiO2 photocatalysis reached ?70% overall removal with particularly high efficiency for synthetic musks. In terms of power usage efficiency expressed as nmol kJ-1, the results showed that ozonation was by far the most efficient process, ten-fold over Xe/Ce-TiO2 visible light photocatalysis, the latter being in turn considerably more efficient than UV irradn. In all cases the efficiency decreased along the treatments due to the lower reaction rate at lower pollutant concn. The use of photocatalysis greatly improved the efficiency of visible light irradn. The collector area per order decreased from 9.14 \u00b1 5.11 m2 m-3 order-1 for visible light irradn. to 0.16 \u00b1 0.03 m2 m-3 order-1 for Ce-TiO2 photocatalysis.

The use of UV light to inactivate microbial species has proven effective, however; standard UV lamps have proven to be less effective in their ability to inactivate parasites and bacterial endospores in water treatment settings. Pulsed UV (PUV) light may potentially provide a novel alternative to water and wastewater disinfection. Research outlined in this study assesses the potential of a novel PUV system for the rapid and reproducible inactivation of a range of test species including Bacillus endospores. In comparison to standard low-pressure (LP) UV lamps, this PUV system provided significantly higher levels of inactivation for all test species. Furthermore, there was a remarkable decrease in time needed to obtain significant inactivation rates following treatment with PUV compared to LP-UV. With the PUV system, a 70-second treatment time (7.65 ?J/cm2) resulted in similar inactivation rates of Bacillus endospores to that of the LP-UV inactivation of their vegetative counterpart. Also, at PUV doses exceeding 4.32 J/cm2, there was not a significant difference in the PUV inactivation of Bacillus endospores in the absence or presence of 10 ppm organic matter. However, the presence of organic matter resulted in a significant reduction in microbial inactivation for all treatment doses using the LP-UV system.

Both magnetic iron and seamino treatments greatly reduced the harmful effects of soil salinity and significantly improved vegetative growth, yield and some physiol. parameters such as leaf osmotic pressure and temp. which had some effect on transpiration rate. On the other hand, these two treatments markedly decreased Na, Cl, S and sulforaphane content compared to the control.

In this study, the effectiveness of chlorine dioxide at inactivation of three dominant genera of fungal spores isolated from drinking groundwater and the effects of pH, temperature, chlorine dioxide concentration, and humic acid were evaluated. The inactivation mechanisms were explored by analyzing the leakage of intracellular substances, the increase in extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and proteins as well as the changes in spore morphology. The kinetics of inactivation by chlorine dioxide fitted the Chick-Watson model, and different fungal species showed different resistance to chlorine dioxide inactivation, which was in the following order: Cladosporium sp.>Trichoderma sp. >Penicillium sp., which are much more resistant than Escherichia coli. Regarding the three genera of fungal spores used in this study, chlorine dioxide was more effective at inactivation of fungal spores than chlorine. The effect of disinfectant concentration and temperature was positive, and the impact of pH levels (6.0 and 7.0) was insignificant, whereas the influence of water matrices on the inactivation efficiency was negative. The increased concentration of characteristic extracellular substances and changes of spore morphology were observed after inactivation with chlorine dioxide and were due to cell wall and cell membrane damage in fungal spores, causing the leakage of intracellular substances and death of a fungal spore.", "label": 0}

The method is based on the fact that a specific inactivation level of microorganisms is achieved at a unique value of ozone exposures, independent of ozone dose and type of water, and quantitatively described by a Delayed Chick-Watson model (CTlag: 1.03 mg 1(-1), k: 1.44 mg(-1) min(-1)). This study demonstrated this phenomenon by performing the inactivation of Bacillus subtilis (R subtilis) spores with ozone in various types of water collected from a series of unit processes in a water treatment plant. Simple measurements of the ozone decomposition behavior in waters from each unit process of a water treatment plant can allow the quantitative evaluation of the ozone needed to achieve a required level of inactivation. This methodology will be useful for drinking water treatment plants which intend to improve the disinfection efficiencies of their ozonation process. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Role of the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) system", "abstract": "Data on the ability of chemical poultry decontaminants to induce an acid stress response in pathogenic bacteria are lacking. This study was undertaken in order to compare the survival rates in acid broths of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica strains, both exposed to and not exposed to decontaminants. The contribution of the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) acid resistance system to the survival of bacteria in acid media was also examined. Four strains (L. monocytogenes serovar 1/2, L. monocytogenes serovar 4b, S. enterica serotype Typhymurium and S. enterica serotype Enteritidis) were tested before (control) and after exposure to trisodium phosphate, acidified sodium chlorite, citric acid, chlorine dioxide and peroxyacids (strains were repeatedly passed through media containing increasing concentrations of a compound). Stationary-phase cells (10(8) cfu/ml) were inoculated into tryptic soy broth (TSB) acidified with citric acid (pH 2.7 and 5.0) with or without glutamate (10 mM) added, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 15 min. Survival percentages (calculated from viable colonies) varied from 2.47 +/- 0.67% to 91.93 +/- 5.83%. L. monocytogenes cells previously exposed to acid decontaminants (citric acid and peroxyacids) showed, when placed in acid TSB, a higher (P < 0.05) percentage of survival (average 38.80 +/- 30.52%) than control and pre-exposed to non-acidic decontaminants strains (22.82 +/- 23.80%). Similar (P > 0.05) survival percentages were observed in previously exposed to different decontaminants and control Salmonella strains. The GAD acid resistance system did not apparently play any role in the survival of L. monocytogenes or S. enterica at a low pH. This study demonstrates for the first time that prior exposure to acidic poultry decontaminants increases the percentage of survival of L. monocytogenes exposed to severe acid stress. These results have important implications for the meat industry when considering which decontaminant treatment to adopt.", "label": 0}

Therefore, browning and foodborne pathogen have become the most serious problems. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of lactic acid (0.25%, 0.5%, 1% and 2% (v/v)) on reduction of foodborne pathogens, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes, in lotus sprouts. Tap water and sodium hypochlorite (200\u00a0mg/l) were used as control treatments. Results indicated that tap water caused a slight reduction (&lt;0.5 log) in the microbial loads. The sodium hypochlorite treatment led to 1.3 log reductions of the microbial population. When treated with 0.5% and 2.0% lactic acid solutions, 1.5 and 2.3 log reductions were achieved, respectively. The effectiveness of lactic acid treatment increased with the increase of lactic acid concentration. Results showed that the lactic acid treatment at 0.5% or higher was effective to reduce foodborne pathogens in lotus sprouts. The L* values of samples treated with lactic acid decreased slightly during storage. Furthermore, the lactic acid treatment contributed to slow accumulation of red color on lotus sprouts, which was more effective than sodium hypochlorite treatment to reduce the discoloration of lotus sprouts. These results indicated that lactic acid can be used to improve the color and safety of minimally processed lotus sprouts.", "label": 1}

In gravel medium watered with a nutrient solution containing 150 mol/m(3) of NaCl and 10 mol/m(3) of CaCl2, a salt concentration equal to one-quarter strength seawater, the dry weight of live tops was reduced by an average of 58% relative to the non-saline treatment, whereas the reductions in the salt-tolerant control species, tall wheatgrass [Thinopyrum ponticum (Podp.) Z.-W. Liu & R.-C. Wang] and Aegilops tauschii Coss., were 13.4% and 26.6%, respectively. Sirolan was the highest yielding phalaris population under both saline and non-saline conditions, and Grasslands Maru and cv. Australian and its relatives were some of the least affected by salt. In a second experiment, the sodium content of the herbage of 1-3 cloned plants in each of 22 phalaris accessions averaged 1.62% in the treated offsets and 0.10% in the untreated offsets. Two genotypes in one accession, CPI 19315 from Morocco, had exceptionally low sodium concentrations and Na/K ratios in plants treated with salt. The means for these traits in CPI 19315 were 4.6 g/kg DM and 0.09, respectively, compared with means in the other 21 lines of 17.7 and 0.35. CPI 19315 plants were crossed to seed-retaining, waterlogging-tolerant segregants from the backcross of P. aquatica x P. arundinacea to P. aquatica. The F-2 was compared with CPI 19315 and Grasslands Maru phalaris, Dundas tall wheatgrass, and AU Triumph tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) on a winter-wet, saline discharge cline east of Wagga Wagga, NSW. Seedling density, emergence score, and dry matter yield at the end of the first growing season varied significantly among grasses and positions on the salinity/waterlogging gradient. However, the genotype and salinity effects on yield disappeared when seedling density was used as a covariate. Nevertheless, except for Dundas tall wheatgrass, herbage yield was correlated with position in the gradient, the F-2 and Dundas tall wheatgrass being less affected by increasing stress than Grasslands Maru, CPI 19315, and AU Triumph tall fescue. Seed was harvested from putative seed-retaining F-2 plants, and seedlings were transplanted into a saline discharge area near Canberra, ACT. The families differed significantly in injury and survival. The narrow-sense heritability of freedom from leaf injury was 0.52 +/- 0.28. Seed was again harvested from seed retaining survivors, and fourth generation seedlings were grown on the same area for continued selection. The plants in 3 family groups were significantly larger than of those in any of the control cultivar groups after 5 months exposure to waterlogging and salinity. Most survived the ensuing summer and autumn. The possibility of developing a cultivar better suited to saline, winter-wet, summer-dry soils is discussed.", "label": 0}

Food safety is essential considering that there are reports of outbreaks involving the consumption of fruits and vegetables contaminated with pathogens. Washing associated with sanitizer procedure is considered as a critical step to satisfy hygienic and sanitary requirements and maintain the sensory and nutritional characteristics of fruits and vegetables. Chemical compounds are widely applied to clean and sanitize fresh fruits and vegetables, and some of these chemicals, such as the inorganic chlorine compounds, produce by-products that are dangerous to human health. The use of ultrasound is a technology that is gaining ground in the food industry. Ultrasound is a form of energy generated by sound waves at frequencies that are too high to be detected by the human ear. In ultrasound, the removal of dirt and food residues from surfaces and the inactivation of microorganisms occur as a consequence of cavitation, which is the formation, growth and collapse of bubbles that generate a localized mechanical and chemical energy. There are indications that this technology can be used in the food industry, alone or associated with chemical sanitizers. In this paper, we discuss the principles, mechanisms and effects of ultrasound on fruits and vegetables as a sanitization technology.", "label": 0}

The recently solved heptameric structure of the small mechanosensitive channel of Escherichia coli, MscS, has revealed a relatively wide (7-15 A) yet highly hydrophobic transmembrane pore. Continuum estimations based on the properties of pore surface suggest low conductance and a thermodynamic possibility of dewetting. To test the predictions we performed molecular dynamics simulations of MscS filled with flexible TIP3P water. Irrespective to the initial conditions, several independent 6-ns simulations converged to the same stable state with the pore water-filled in the wider part, but predominantly empty in the narrow hydrophobic part, displaying intermittent vapor-liquid transitions. The polar gain-of-function substitution L109S in the constriction resulted in a stable hydration of the entire pore. Steered passages of Cl(-) ions through the narrow part of the pore consistently produced partial ion dehydration and required a force of 200-400 pN to overcome an estimated barrier of 10-20 kcal/mole, implying negligibly low conductance. We conclude that the crystal structure of MscS does not represent an open state. We infer that MscS gate, which is similar to that of the nicotinic ACh receptor, involves a vapor-lock mechanism where limited changes of geometry or surface polarity can locally switch the regime between water-filled (conducting) and empty (nonconducting) states.", "label": 0}

The remaining, unligated, iron ion of the cluster binds in contact with the ?-amino and ?-carboxylate groups of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM). This binding mode facilitates inner-sphere electron transfer from the reduced form of the cluster into the sulfur atom of SAM, resulting in a reductive cleavage of SAM to methionine and a 5?-deoxyadenosyl radical. The 5?-deoxyadenosyl radical then abstracts a target substrate hydrogen atom, initiating a wide variety of radical-based transformations. A subset of radical SAM enzymes contains one or more additional iron\u2013sulfur clusters that are required for the reactions they catalyze. However, outside of a subset of sulfur insertion reactions, very little is known about the roles of these additional clusters. This review will highlight the most recent advances in the identification and characterization of radical SAM enzymes that harbor auxiliary iron\u2013sulfur clusters.

The study demonstrated that PFA provides rapid, efficient and safe disinfection, degrading both bacteria and viruses even at low doses. The resistance order starting from the most resistant microorganism is as follows: MS2-coliphages > DNA-coliphages > enterococci and Escherichia coli. PFA is also efficient in the elimination of Salmonella spp., Clostridium perfringens spores and Giardia cysts. The results showed that a PFA dose as low as 0.5-1 mg L(-1) with contact time of 10 min was efficient in achieving and maintaining for 72 h the disinfection level required for unrestricted agricultural water reuse (</=3 log units for faecal coliforms). However, the optimal dose will depend on the quality of wastewater. Regarding the formation of by-products during disinfection with PFA, very low amounts of hydrogen peroxide and organic per-acids were observed; active oxygen was not detected. The amounts of adsorbable organically bound halogens (AOX) compounds formed were significantly lower compared to the amounts generated during chlorine disinfection. This chlorine-free solution enables compliance with microbiological criteria for various water reuse applications and is already on the market for advanced disinfection.", "label": 0}

Earlier observations revealed that this phenomenon can be reduced if effluent is treated with oxidants. To det. the role of oxidants in these processes and to obtain meaningful and reproducible results, synthetic effluent rather than authentic effluent was used. However, the synthetic effluent was composed to provide the best possible resemblance to a natural effluent, and the effect of Cl2 and ClO2 on effluent constituents was studied. Effluent Cl and ClO2 demand were 5-8 and 3-4 mg/L, resp. A 2 mg/L concn. of either oxidant caused a rapid bacteria inactivation that reached 4 orders of magnitude after 1 min. With respect to algae, concns. ?20 mg/L of either oxidant did not affect the no. of algal cells, although the oxidants caused a remarkable decrease in algal viability as expressed by its chlorophyll content and replication ability. Both oxidants demonstrated a notable aggregation effect on the effluent. Results described above were examd. in a pilot system. Continued chlorination at 5-10 mg/L Cl applied directly to the drippers was not effective due to the presence of clogging agents immune to low Cl concns. produced in the reservoir and carried to the drippers with the effluent. Batch treatment combined with settling was much more efficient and significantly reduced clogging because the Cl reacted as a disinfectant and as a coagulant due to the oxidn. of humic constituents.

In humans, hepatocellular cancer is associated with iron overload and hepatic porphyria. Neither the mechanism of hepatic carcinogenesis induced by PCBs in rodents nor hepatocellular cancer induced by iron and porphyria in humans are understood. To test the hypothesis that chronic interaction of iron and PCBs may induce mutagenesis in liver DNA, lambda /lacI transgenic C57BL/6 mice were given iron dextran (600 mg iron/kg) and then administered Aroclor 1254 in the diet (0.01%) for 7 weeks. Hepatic iron, CYP1A activity and CYP1A1/1A2 protein were elevated >20-fold as a result of iron or Aroclor treatments, respectively, but porphyria with associated histological changes only developed in the combined iron/Aroclor treatment group. lambda/lacI shuttle vectors were isolated from liver genomic DNA and the mutational frequency (MF) in the lacI gene determined. Both iron and Aroclor treatments alone caused significant small increases in MF (1.5- and 1.4-fold, respectively), however, the MF following the combined iron and Aroclor treatment (1. 6-fold) was not greater than the additive effects. In contrast, the MF was significantly elevated (4.7-fold) in liver DNA of mice 2 weeks following five daily doses of N-nitrosodimethylamine (4 mg/kg). These studies demonstrate that neither PCBs nor iron overload caused marked point mutations even in a combination regime that leads to oxidative damage and cancer. There was also no strong evidence either that porphyrins or chronic CYP1A1 expression induced by the PCBs after this period caused marked point mutagens or simple deletions.

It is based on the more selective accumulation of a photosensitizer in malignant than normal tissue with low systemic toxicity. Subsequent light activation induces photo-oxidation, followed by selective tumour destruction via vascular and direct cellular mechanisms. Malignant brain tumours carry a lethal prognosis with a median survival of 15 months despite surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. PDT is therefore a logical therapeutic concept for brain tumours infiltrating into normal brain. In this review, all the available data on patients treated with haematoporphyrin derivative-mediated PDT are critically analysed. Over 310 patients have been reported in the literature suffering from primary or recurrent malignant brain tumours which were treated with PDT following tumour resection in open clinical phase I/II trials. This number includes 58 patients treated at our own institution. Variations in the treatment protocols make evaluation scientifically difficult; however, there is a clear trend of increased median survival after surgical resection and one single photodynamic treatment. PDT is generally well tolerated and side effects consist of moderate increased intracranial pressure and prolonged skin sensitivity to direct sunlight. The current available data indicate that PDT is a safe treatment, which is well tolerated by the patients and yields an improvement in survival of those with malignant brain tumours. Conclusive information can be expected from controlled clinical trials which are currently being designed. The results raise the hope that PDT will be a valuable addition to the armamentarium for the treatment of cerebral malignancies.", "label": 0}

The overwhelming and increasing body of evidence from studies in vitro showed that bacteria have an immense capacity to respond to chemical stress brought upon by biocides. Empirically two major types of mechanisms have been described: intrinsic and acquired. However, the increasing documented response from bacteria exposed to biocide in conditions close to those found in practice suggests that intrinsic resistance does not adequately describe bacterial survival mechanisms, and that other terms such as biofilm resistance and environmental resistance would be therefore more appropriate. In addition, such terms are more relevant when describing in-situ conditions. The lack of evidence of bacterial resistance in practice and the inability to correlate emerging bacterial resistance from in-vitro experiments with practical situations is a major drawback when attempting to ascertain whether emerging bacterial resistance in healthcare facilities is of genuine concern. Microbial resistance to high or in-use concentration of biocides has been described in practice, although it remains uncommon. The efficacy of biocides in eliminating bacterial contaminants within healthcare facilities has to be questioned with the widespread and increasing use of products containing low concentrations of biocide or possessing low bactericidal activity, as is the selection of less susceptible bacteria following such exposure.", "label": 0}

One of the many factors limiting efficacy is the high interfacial tension of chlorine-based sanitizers that limits the access of chlorine to the microorganisms. In this work, we investigated the efficacy of sodium hypochlorite (200 ppm, pH 6.0) at 4 and 20 degrees C against Escherichia coli O157:H7 inoculated on baby spinach leaves as affected by the surfactant sucrose monolaurate (SML) at below (100 ppm), above (250 ppm), and well above (10,000 ppm) the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of ~200 ppm at 20 degrees C. The surfactant-containing chlorine treatments were compared to those with buffer only, surfactant only, and chlorine only. Significantly improved inactivation, as evidenced by survival of E. coli O157:H7 was achieved when 250 or 10,000 ppm SML was added with chlorine. This is attributed to the reduction of interfacial tension between the sanitizing solutions and spinach surface. Treatments at 20 degrees C resulted in greater mean inactivation than those at 4 degrees C but the difference was not significant. Comparisons of SML concentrations in treatment solutions before and after sanitization showed that SML decreased more at a lower temperature and when chlorine was present, resulting from adsorption of SML onto spinach matrix. Our work illustrates the importance of using surfactants at concentrations above the CMC to enhance the efficacy of chlorine sanitization.", "label": 1}

We have examined the ability of phenol and the 19 isomers of chlorophenol to induce DNA damage using the Microscreen prophage-induction assay in Escherichia coli. Seven of the isomers (2,3,4,-tri, 2,4,5-tri, 3,4,5-tri, 2,3,4,5-tetra, 2,3,6-tri, 2,4,6-tri, and pentachlorophenol) induced prophage lambda in the presence of S9, with the first three being approximately 10 times more potent than the last three. The more potent isomers have either one or no chlorine atom ortho to the OH group; whereas the less potent isomers have two chlorine atoms ortho to the OH group. Although none of the 20 compounds is mutagenic in Salmonella, the prophage-induction results agree with findings by others that most of these seven isomers are clastogenic, are associated with cancer and chromosomal aberrations in humans (pentachlorophenol), and are carcinogenic in rodents (2,4,6-tri and pentachlorophenol). A likely basis for the genotoxicity of the seven isomers involves the metabolism of the parent isomer to a chlorohydroquinone, which can form a chlorobenzosemiquinone in the presence of oxygen. These two metabolites can produce free radicals that can cause DNA strand breaks, resulting in prophage induction in E. coli or, possibly, the chromosomal aberrations/cancer associated with human exposure to chlorophenols.", "label": 0}

HCL has usually an indolent course and the patients with asymptomatic disease do not require therapy. Treatment of progressive symptomatic HCL includes a variety of pharmacological approaches such as interferon-?

They are also active in relapsed patients. More recently high activity of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) and anti-CD25 (LMB-2) and anti-CD22 (BL-22) immunotoxins have increased the number of therapeutic options for HCL. Splenectomy may be still indicated in patients with massive, symptomatic splenomegaly or results in severe cytopenia.

However the results of published research are inconsistent and sometimes contradictory creating a need to formally evaluate, synthesize and summarize available research to avoid recommending ineffective treatments and identify key knowledge gaps for future work. Objective Evaluate intervention research that measured the efficacy of various spray and dip treatments, applied on broiler chicken carcasses during primary processing, as Salmonella prevalence or concentration on broiler carcasses, using systematic review\u2013meta-analysis (SR\u2013MA). Data sources A comprehensive electronic search was implemented in six databases and verified through a manual search of topic-related reference lists, related reviews or book chapters, and through consultations with selected topic experts. Study inclusion Control and challenge trials, cohort and before-and-after intervention research published in English that investigated the efficacy of any spray or dip treatments, applied to broiler chicken carcasses or carcass parts during processing, on Salmonella prevalence or concentration measured at the same level under laboratory, pilot plant and commercial conditions. Risk of bias assessment and data extraction Relevant research was evaluated for methodological soundness and completeness of reporting. The main characteristics of each study included in the review were extracted. Data analysis Random-effects MA of trisodium phosphate and lactic acid dip treatments (n = 12 and n = 32 trials with prevalence outcomes, respectively) resulted in homogeneous (p-value = 0.469; I2 = 0.0% and p-value = 0.284; I2 = 11.4%, respectively) summary effect estimates (OR = 1.16; 95% CI: 0.59\u20132.26 and OR = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.03\u20130.10, respectively). Visual evaluation of MA forest plots indicated overall reduction trends for six spray treatments reporting concentration outcomes: trisodium phosphate (n = 48 trials), acidic electrolyzed oxidizing water (n = 2), cetylpyridinium chloride (n = 43), lactic acid (n = 24), sodium bisulfate (n = 11) and potable water (n = 36). Moderate to considerable heterogeneity (p-value ? 0.1 and I2 &gt; 25%) was observed for these treatments. Methodological soundness of included studies was poor and a lack of studies conducted under commercial conditions was observed. Conclusions Existing research on the efficacy of broiler carcass dips or sprays on Salmonella prevalence or concentration is limited and heterogeneous, precluding the full benefits of robust meta-analyses. Larger randomized controlled trials conducted under commercial conditions are needed.", "label": 1}

The Zimba, an automated batch chlorinator, requires no electricity or moving parts, and can be installed at shared water points with intermittent flow. We conducted a small-scale trial to assess the acceptability and quality of Zimba-treated municipal water. Fieldworkers collected stored drinking water over a 10-week period from control (n = 24 households) and treatment (n = 30 households) compounds to assess levels of free chlorine and E. coli contamination. Overall, 80% of stored drinking water samples had a safe chlorine residual among treatment households, compared to 29% among control households (P < 0.001). Concentrations of E. coli were lower (mean difference = 0.4 log colony-forming units/100 mL, P = 0.004) in treatment compared to control households. Fifty-three percent of mothers (n = 17), thought the Zimba was easy to use and 76% were satisfied with the taste. The majority of mothers mentioned that collecting water from the Zimba took more time and created a long queue at the handpump. The Zimba successfully chlorinated household stored drinking water; however, further technology development is required to address user preferences. The Zimba may be a good option for point-of-collection water treatment in areas where queuing for water is uncommon.", "label": 1}
{"id": "7649", "title": "Microbiological water quality management in the Paris suburbs distribution system", "abstract": "Water quality in distribution systems can deteriorate due to regrowth, contamination passing though the treatment works, or possible water intrusion within the distribution system. In order to prevent and control biofilm development, most water utilities chlorinate the treated water. It is also necessary to decrease the dissolved organic carbon as this increases chlorine stability during distribution while also reducing the formation of trihalomethanes (THM). This dual approach, based on pilot results, modelling and full-scale studies, is used by Syndicat des Eaux d'Ile de France (SEDIF) for the Paris suburbs. In order to define its management strategy, several studies were carried out by SEDIF concerning microbiological water quality, and these are summarised in the first part of this paper. Pilot and modelling studies have indicated to what degree biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) should be removed in plants to limit bacterial regrowth. However, other works have reported that bacteria such as Escherichia coli can survive and even grow regardless of the low nutrient level in the distribution system. Consequently, SEDIF has introduced biological treatment into its water plants to optimise BDOC removal, and provided rechlorination facilities to attain a free chlorine residual of 0.1 mg Cl-2 l(-1) throughout its supply system. Some slight regrowth can still be observed in the distribution system, through dissolved organic carbon consumption in the network and increases in viable bacterial counts. Nonetheless, quality control data indicate that a good bacteriological quality has been attained, with minimum quantities of disinfection by-products.", "label": 1}

Previous studies carried out by our research group provided strong evidence that a lectin could be involved with the toxic properties of I. asarifolia. To reinforce this hypothesis, a lectin-enriched fraction (LEF) was isolated from I. asarifolia leaves and its toxic effects were assessed. Leaves of I. asarifolia were excised from plants growing widely in the field, mechanically wounded and maintained in a chamber at 25\u00b13\u00b0C for 72h in the dark, under near 100% relative humidity. The leaf proteins were extracted, ammonium sulfate precipitated, chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose and Phenyl-Sepharose to produce LEF that under SDS-PAGE showed a molecular mass of 44.0kDa and after N-terminal amino acid analysis a primary sequence composed of AGYTPVLDIGAEVLAAGEPY. The in vivo toxicity of LEF assessed by intraorbital injection in mice showed induced severe uncoordinated movements without death. LEF reduced the muscular contraction in a dose depend way and at 29.8?g/mL (CE50) it produces 50% inhibition of contraction, suggesting that LEF blunts autonomic neurotransmission. Isolated rat kidneys were perfused with LEF and no effects on the perfusion pressure or renal vascular resistance were observed, but urinary flow and glomerular filtration rate increased. Moreover, the percentage of tubular transport of Na+, K+ and Cl- decreased. Histological examination of the kidneys perfused with LEF exhibited little alterations. These toxic effects observed above were concomitant with the increase of LEF hemagglutination activity, which strongly suggest that one of the toxic principles of I. asarifolia is a lectin present in its leaves. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.", "label": 0}

Our results indicate that all sanitizers tested were more efficient against L. monocytogenes attached to nonporous surfaces than to porous surfaces. After 10 min of contact time, the limit concentration of disinfectants was at least 5 to 10 times higher for sanitizing rubber than stainless steel or glass surfaces.

{"id": "3912", "title": "Effectiveness of chlorine dioxide in disinfection on two soft denture liners", "abstract": "STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Soft tissue denture liners frequently require replacement that necessitates complete removal from the denture base. A high speed lathe located in a \"clean laboratory\" is often used to facilitate removal of these materials, but it is unclear whether routine disinfection procedures reduce bacterial contamination sufficiently to prevent contamination of the laboratory. PURPOSE: The first phase of this study evaluated the effectiveness of 3-minute chlorine dioxide spray and immersion disinfection procedures on 2 denture liners (Coe Soft and Coe Comfort) and stainless steel specimens used as controls. The second phase evaluated the effectiveness of spray disinfection at time intervals of 1, 3, and 10 minutes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Specimens made of soft denture liners attached to acrylic resin bases (10 per group) were contaminated with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. Colony-forming units were counted after different disinfection techniques were applied. Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of variance on ranks and an all pairwise multiple comparison procedures (Dunn's method) were used to test for significant differences among test groups at the P <.05 level of significance. RESULTS: Chlorine dioxide was effective against nonporous stainless steel specimens but was inadequate for denture liners at the recommended 3-minute time of disinfection. The immersion technique was more effective than the spray technique, but the difference was not significant. Increasing the time of disinfection did not significantly reduce the numbers of microorganisms. CONCLUSION: Coe Soft and Coe Comfort denture liners should be removed before entering the laboratory. These materials contain sufficient viable bacteria after routine disinfection procedures to cause contamination of the \"clean laboratory.\"", "label": 0}
{"id": "5394", "title": "Isolation of cDNA from Jacaratia mexicana encoding a mexicain-like cysteine protease gene", "abstract": "Cysteine proteases (CPs) from the C1 family, which are similar to papain, can be found in animals and plants, as well as some viruses and prokaryotes. These enzymes have diverse physiological functions and are thus very attractive for science and industry. Jacaratia mexicana, a member of the Caricaceae plant family, contains several CPs, the principal being mexicain, found to favorably compete against papain for many industrial applications due to its high stability and specific activity. In this study, leaves of J. mexicana were used to isolate a CP-coding gene, similar to those that code for mexicain and chymomexicain. By using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) as well as oligonucleotide design from papain-like conserved amino acids (aa), a sequence of 1404 bp consisting of a 5? terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 153 bp, a 3? terminal UTR of 131 bp, with a polyadenylation (poly(A)) signal sequence and a poly(A) tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 1046 bp, was obtained by overlapping three partial sequences. Two full-length cDNA sequences that encode for mexicain-like proteases were cloned from mRNA (JmCP4 and JmCP5). JmCP4 is predicted to have an ORF of 1044 bp, which codifies for polypeptides that have a 26 aa signal peptide region, a 108 aa propeptide region and a mature enzyme of 214 aa. A 969 bp fragment (JmCP5) encodes for a partial sequence of a CP gene, without the signal peptide region but with a full-length propeptide region. The sequence analysis showed that this protease presented a high similarity to other plant CPs from J. mexicana, Vasconcellea cundinamarcensis, Vasconcellea stipulata, and Carica papaya, among others, mainly at the conserved catalytic site. Obtaining the sequence of this CP gene from J. mexicana provides an alternative for production in a standard system and could be an initial step towards the commercialization of this enzyme.", "label": 0}

Two-dimensional NMR structural characterization of the polysaccharide, named pzX, revealed that it is composed of an unusual three amino-sugar sequence repeat of [-3)XylNAc40Ac(alpha 1-3)(GlcNAcA4OAc(alpha 1-3)XylNAc(alpha 1-](n). The sugar residue XylNAc had never been described previously in any glycan structure. The XNAC operon that contains the genes for the assembly of pzX is also unique and so far has been identified only in members of the Bacillus cereus sensu lato group. Microscopic and biochemical analyses indicate that pzX co-forms during sporulation, so that upon the release of the spore to the extracellular milieu it becomes surrounded by pzX. The relative amounts of pzX produced can be manipulated by specific nutrients in the medium, but rich medium appears to suppress pzX formation. pzX has the following unique characteristics: a surfactant property that lowers surface tension, a cell/spore antiaggregant, and an adherence property that increases spores binding to surfaces. pzX in Bacillus could represent a trait shared by many spore-producing microorganisms. It suggests pzX is an active player in spore physiology and may provide new insights to the successful survival of the B. cereus species in natural environments or in the hosts.", "label": 0}

L. monocytogenes grew at all incubation temperatures on lettuce not treated with carrot juice. Treatment with 20 or 50% carrot juice resulted in significantly (P ? 0\u00b705) lower populations of viable L. monocytogenes throughout the 14-day incubation period at 5\u00b0 C.

In-shell pecans and nutmeats (U.S. Department of Agriculture medium pieces) were immersion inoculated with a mixture of five Salmonella serotypes, dried to 3.7% moisture, and stored at 4 degrees C for 3 to 6 weeks. In-shell nuts were immersed in chlorinated water (200, 400, and 1,000 mug/ml), lactic acid (0.5, 1, and 2%), and levulinic acid (0.5, 1, and 2%) with and without 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and a mixed peroxyacid sanitizer (Tsunami 200, 40 mug/ml) for up to 20 min at 21 degrees C. The rate of reduction of free chlorine in conditioning water decreased as the ratio of in-shell nuts/water was increased. The rate of reduction was more rapid when nuts were not precleaned before treatment. The initial population of Salmonella on in-shell nuts (5.9 to 6.3 log CFU/g) was reduced by 2.8 log CFU/g after treating with chlorinated water (1,000 mug/ml). Treatment with 2% lactic acid plus SDS or 2% levulinic acid plus SDS reduced the pathogen by 3.7 and 3.4 log CFU/g, respectively. Lactic and levulinic acids (2%) without SDS were less effective (3.3- and 2.1-log CFU/g reductions, respectively) than acids with SDS.

Their effects on its ubiquinol-1 oxidase activity were compared with those on the cytochrome bd complex in E. coli and on cytochromes o and alpha 1 in Acetobacter aceti. They showed similar structural properties of the QL site, although cytochrome o was more sensitive to 4-cyanophenols, suggesting a specific interaction of the hydrogen bond-accepting cyano group with the binding pocket. Replacing one of the methyl groups of 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, which is the most potent competitive inhibitor, with an ethyl group markedly decreased the inhibitory activity, indicating that the QL site specifically recognizes one C = O group with two methyl groups as the ortho-substituents. In substituted phenols, ortho-chlorine substituents were the most effective in recognition, and the electron-withdrawing ability of the para-substituent determined an inhibitory potency, probably by stabilizing an anionic form. Based on these observations, we postulate that the QL site of the cytochrome bo complex asymmetrically recognizes exogenous ligands and that this property accounts for the sequential electron transfer from ubiquinols to the low-spin heme.", "label": 0}

P. fluorescens demonstrated greater hydrophobicity than both other strains and proved the most adherent bacterium over all substrata investigated. Particle-mediated resistance to chlorination was investigated using short bacteria-particle association times and activity assays that employed sensitive epifluorescent detection. Consistent with adhesive behaviours, the bacterial strain that demonstrated the greatest particle-mediated chlorination resistance was the environmental strain of P. fluorescens. Resistance was observed to vary with both bacteria and particle type, and demonstrated a moderate correlation with adhesion (r(2) >/= 0.65). The short-term approach employed in our study demonstrates particle-mediated protection without the commonly assumed requirements of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) or a large particle-based chlorine demand. Consequently, we have linked resistance with adhesion capacities and demonstrated a limit to resistance in the presence of additional particle protective sites (through increased turbidity) which appears to be driven by intra-population variance in bacterial surface characteristics. Finally, we observed important differences between behaviours of environmental versus laboratory-derived bacterial strains and particles, which highlight the importance of employing both approaches in characterising \"real world\" systems.", "label": 1}

Chlorine-based disinfectants applied when produce is packed are widely used to control microorganisms. When applied properly, the chlorine products are effective. However, hazardous disinfection breakdown products can be formed, and chlorine disinfectants have high oxidant activity that can affect produce quality and pose a risk to food handlers. Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (QACs) are a disinfectant alternative for the washing of fruits and vegetables. They can control a great number of microorganisms, have low toxicity when used at recommended doses, and are stable in storage. The purpose of this work was to assess the disinfectant activity of QACs against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus under worst-case and average-case turbidity conditions, (2 and 100 nephelometric units); two disinfectant concentrations (100 and 200 mg/L; and two contact times (30 and 120 seconds). Our research showed that QACs were effective against both bacteria. The percentage reduction of Escherichia coli was significantly higher in the less turbid solution (P = 0.027), while turbidity did not affect the reduction of Staphylococcus aureus (P > 0.05). E. coli was more resistant to QAC treatment than S. aureus. Based on the data obtained we can conclude that QACs could be an alternative in washing processes of fruits and vegetables.", "label": 0}

Subsequent culture for amoebal viability indicated that only Prymesoak and 10:10 provided 100% efficacy of action against lens-associated Acanthamoeba cysts, but Prymesoak required overnight incubation for such an effect. Sonication before incubation did not significantly improve the acanthamoebicidal properties of the disinfecting systems.", "label": 0}
{"id": "6348", "title": "Discovery of novel inhibitors of LEDGF/p75-IN protein\u2013protein interactions", "abstract": "Human lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75 plays an important role in the HIV life cycle by stimulating integrase (IN)-led viral DNA integration into cellular chromosomes. Mechanistic studies show the majority of IN inhibitors chelate magnesium ions in the catalytic active site, a region topologically distant from the LEDGF/p75 binding site. Compounds disrupting the formation of LEDGF/p75 and IN complexes serve as a novel mechanistic approach different from current antiretroviral therapies. We previously built pharmacophore models mimicking LEDGF/p75 residues and identified four classes of LEDGF/p75-IN inhibitors. Substructure and similarity searches yielded additional LEDGF/p75-IN inhibitors containing an acylhydrazone moiety. The most potent of the acylhydrazones inhibited LEDGF/p75-IN interaction with an IC50 value of 400 nM. We explored structure\u2013activity relationships (SAR) and identified new acylhydrazones, hydrazines, and diazenes as lead molecules for further optimization. Two lead LEDGF/p75-IN inhibitors showed antiviral activity.", "label": 0}
