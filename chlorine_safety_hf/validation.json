The crystal structures of 3-nitro-2-(phenylselanyl)-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (5a), 2-(mesitylselanyl)-3-nitro-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (5d) and 3-nitro-2-(pyridin-2-ylselanyl)-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (5e) were confirmed by X-ray crystallography and the DFT calculations were performed to determine various structural parameters which were correlated with the X-ray crystal structures. The synthesized compounds were subjected to antimicrobial evaluation and it was found that compounds 5a and 5j were active against gram negative bacterium Escherichia coli whereas compound 5e was active against different fungal strains. Time kill assay was performed to understand the microbial activity of synthesized organoselenium compounds and the toxicity of these compounds was evaluated against human cell lines. Synergistic effects of active compounds 5a and 5e were tested with existing antibiotic drugs which exhibited that the antibiotic combination with synthesized organoselenium compounds efficiently enhanced the antimicrobial activity.", "label": 0}
{"id": "6964", "title": "Comparative chlorine and temperature tolerance of the oyster Crassostrea madrasensis: implications for cooling system fouling", "abstract": "Crassostrea madrasensis is an important fouling oyster in tropical industrial cooling water systems. C. madrasensis individuals attach to surfaces by cementing one of their two valves to the substratum. Therefore, oyster fouling creates more problems than mussel fouling in the cooling conduits of power stations, because unlike the latter, the shell of the former remains attached to the substratum even after the death of the animal. However, there are no published reports on the tolerance of this species to chlorination and heat treatment. The mortality pattern and physiological behaviour (oxygen consumption and filtration rate) of three size groups (13 mm, 44 mm and 64 mm mean shell length) of C. madrasensis were studied at different residual chlorine concentrations (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3 to 5 mg 1-1) and temperatures (30 degrees C to 45 degrees C). The effect of shell size (= age) on C. madrasensis mortality in the presence of chlorine and taking into account temperature was significant, with the largest size group oysters showing highest resistance. At 1 mg l-1 residual chlorine, the 13 mm and 64 mm size group oysters, took 504 h (21 d) and 744 h (31 d), respectively to reach 100% mortality. At 39 degrees C, the 13 mm size group oysters took 218 min to reach 100% mortality, whereas the 64 mm size group oysters took 325 min. The oxygen consumption and filtration rate of C. madrasensis showed progressive reduction with increasing residual chlorine concentrations. However, the filtration rate and oxygen consumption responses of C. madrasensis were not significantly different between 30 degrees C (control) and 37.5 degrees C. There was a sharp decrease in the filtration rate and oxygen consumption at 38.5 degrees C. A comparison of the present mortality data with previous reports on other bivalves suggests that the chlorine tolerance of C. madrasensis lies in between that of Perna viridis and Perna perna, while its temperature tolerance is significantly higher than that of the other two bivalve species. However, in power station heat exchangers, where simultaneous chlorine and thermal stresses are existent, C. madrasensis may have an edge over other common foulants, because of its high temperature tolerance.", "label": 0}

Here, the binding ability of NoV to porcine mucin is shown to be substantially deficient after UV, thermal, and high pressure treatments. Using qRT-PCR, ? 68% of GI.1 NoV (Norwalk strain) bound to porcine gastric mucin-conjugated magnetic beads (PGM-MBs). Application of 600-MPa high pressure treatments reduced binding of the virus to PGM-MBs by 4.7-log10, as determined by qRT-PCR, while a 300-MPa pressure treatment, reduced binding to PGM-MBs by only 0.45-log10. This is consistent with a previously reported clinical trial (Leon et al., 2011. Appl. Environ Microbiol. 77:5476\u20135482.) which demonstrated inactivation of 4-log10 of GI.1 NoV at 600-MPa. After thermal treatment, binding to PGM-MBs decreased when samples were heated from 0 to 80 \u00b0C. Ultraviolet treatments of 0.5 and 2 J/cm2 reduced observed PGM-MB binding of norovirus to 33% and negligible levels, respectively, from an initially observed 84% binding for untreated NoV. Although thermal and UV treatments are generally recognized to inactivate viruses, verification of NoV inactivation by these treatments may require volunteer studies. In total, these results suggest the loss of NoV binding to porcine mucin as a potential means to preferentially exclude non-infectious virus particles from subsequent RT-PCR detection.", "label": 0}

A\u00a0model was developed for the inactivation of HAV in red berries without supplemented sugar and with different pH values. Nonlinear inactivation curves in acidified raspberries were modelled using an integrated model, with a single equation nesting secondary models of temperature and pH in the primary model.

Excellent predictions were obtained in most cases, while failed predictions provided safe results, with the model predicting higher residual virus titres than what was observed.", "label": 0}

Observation of the lysate with an electron microscope revealed bacteriophage particles with an icosahedral capsid of 57 \u00b1 2 nm; with a collar and a noncontractile tail of 156 \u00b1 3 nm terminating with a baseplate to which a tail fiber was attached. Therefore, phage MLC-A belongs to the Siphoviridae family. This phage was able to survive the pasteurization process and was resistant to alcohols and sodium hypochlorite (400 mg/kg). Only peracetic acid could inactivate high-titer suspensions of phages in a short time. The maximum rates of phage adsorption to its host cells were obtained at 30\u00b0C with a pH between 5 and 7, and in the presence of calcium or magnesium ions. The host range of phage MLC-A encompassed L. paracasei and Lactobacillus casei strains, but it was not able to infect Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Lactobacillus gasseri strains. One-step growth kinetics of its lytic development revealed latent and burst periods of 30 and 135 min, respectively, with a burst size of about 69 \u00b1 4 plaque-forming units per infected cell. Phage MLC-A had a distinctive restriction profile when compared with the 2 well-studied Lactobacillus phages, PL-1 and J-1. The genome size of the MLC-A phage was estimated to be approximately 37 kb. This study presents the description of the first phage specific for L. paracasei isolated in Argentina. The isolation of phage MLC-A indicates that, beside lactic acid bacteria starters, probiotic cultures can also be sensitive to virulent phages in industrial processes.", "label": 1}

Malaria, cryptosporidiosis, African and American trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis threaten human beings, both for the high mortality rates involved and the economic loss resulting from morbidity. Due to the fact that effective immunoprophylaxis is not available at present; preventive sanitary measures and pharmacological approaches are the only sources to control the undesirable effects of such diseases. Current anti-parasitic chemotherapy is expensive, has undesirable side effects or, in many patients, is only marginally effective. Under this point of view molecular biology techniques and drug discovery must walk together in order to find new targets for chemotherapy intervention. The identification of DNA topoisomerases as a promising drug target is based on the clinical success of camptothecin derivatives as anticancer agents. The recent detection of substantial differences between trypanosome and leishmania DNA topoisomerase IB with respect to their homologues in mammals has provided a new lead in the study of the structural determinants that can be effectively targeted. The present report is an up to date review of the new findings on type IB DNA topoisomerase in unicellular parasites and the role of these enzymes as targets for therapeutic agents.", "label": 0}

In this study we report on the persistence of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 in a domestic shower system despite repeated cycles of chlorination at 50mg/L for 1h exposure time, over the course of two and a half years. Persisting isolates were subjected to in-vitro phenotypic analyses and polymerase chain reaction analysis for the toxin-encoding mip gene. Random amplified polymorphic DNA typing was also performed to determine whether the isolates recovered on different occasions were the same strain. We found that seven isolates of L. pneumophila recovered over a two-and-a-half year period are the same genetically defined strain, indicating that the bacteria can persist despite repeated cycles of chlorination after each successive isolation.[on SciFinder (R)]", "label": 1}

Methods The epidemiology of the outbreak is reported. The investigation included screening neonates, parents and staff for MRSA carriage. Molecular strain typing was performed on MRSA isolates. Findings The outbreak affected nine neonates with three severe infections. In addition, four mothers had postpartum mastitis, and three mothers and one father had skin infection. The outbreak strain belonged to the USA300 CA-MRSA clone. Asymptomatic carriage of the outbreak strain was found among neonates, parents and hospital staff. The implementation of appropriate infection control measures in the hospital terminated the outbreak. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first report of a hospital outbreak caused by the USA300 CA-MRSA clone in Europe.

Following oral administration, ABZ is rapidly oxidized into the pharmacologically active chiral sulfoxide metabolite known as ricobendazole (RBZ). As its achiral precursor, RBZ shows very low intestinal absorption due to its poor solubility in water (0.06 mg mL?1). To the best of our knowledge, there is no known example in human medicine of a water-soluble salt form of racemic or enantiomerically pure RBZ. In the present study, we describe in detail the preparation of the sodium (Na) salt of the enantiomers of RBZ through a two-step process: i) the multi-milligram resolution of RBZ by HPLC on the amylose-based Chiralpak IG chiral stationary phase under polar organic mode; ii) the salification of the isolated enantiomers of RBZ by reaction with sodium hydroxide solution. The spectroscopic and chiroptical properties of the RBZ-Na enantiomers were determined. Due to their unique solubility in 0.01 M phosphate buffer at physiological pH (14.49 mg mL?1) and the high sample throughput obtained on semipreparative separation of the non-salified form, it is potentially possible to develop new anthelmintic enantiopure formulations with improved pharmacokinetic properties and lower toxicity.", "label": 0}

DH4 was investigated. Results: The organism grew on mannose, but the amount of lipase secreted was significantly less than on vegetable oils. This study identified a simple substrate for lipase production and established the utility of groundnut oil for increasing the lipase yield. The enzyme was compatible with various ionic and non-ionic surfactants as well as commercial detergents. Lipase activity was strongly inhibited by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), but not by Triton X-100 or Triton X-114 The best assay conditions observed for this lipase was found to be pH 9.0 and 50\u00b0C. The enzyme was stable at alkaline pH and considerable activity was observed at pH 10 and it retained 93% of the residual activity at 60\u00b0C. The lipase showed a novel property of marked activation at alkaline pH. Wash performance analysis of commercial detergent for removal of fatty stains improved upon addition of lipase. Conclusion: The production on cheap vegetable oils, novel properties and resistance towards various surfactants and tolerance to commercial detergents make this lipase a potential additive for detergent formulations.

In this work, we present results on the detection and genetic characterization of these bacteria in the outbreak-recurrent region of Alcoy (Comunidad Valenciana, Spain) using water and biofilm samples. We were particularly interested in studying the presence and distribution of L. pneumophila in the absence of outbreak or sporadic cases of legionellosis and in comparing the efficacy of culturing from water samples with a biofilm-based detection procedure using molecular amplification. To this end, water samples were taken from 120 sites distributed all around the city and its surroundings, as well as 60 biofilm swabs from half of the sampling sites. L. pneumophila could be isolated from water in just 4 of the locations. Touchdown PCR was applied to DNA extracted from water and also biofilm swabs, as a rapid method for both routine and outbreak investigations. L. pneumophila was detected by this method in 14 of the sites in which both water and biofilms were taken, although 13 of them tested positive using only the biofilm samples. These results show a ten-fold increase in the success rate of Legionella detection over water samples. The application of this method to study the presence of L. pneumophila in the water-supply system and risk facilities of Alcoy revealed different strains distributed in different areas of the city. Sequence Type ST578, endemic in the area and responsible for most clinical cases, was detected in one of the sampling sites. The number of positive samples correlated with water temperature but not with chlorine levels. The direct analysis of biofilm swabs improves the detection rate and genetic characterization of L. pneumophila and can complement analyses based on bacterial culture.", "label": 1}

Thymol (THY) from thyme oil has wide inhibitory effects against foodborne pathogens including Salmonella, and has shown great potential as a natural alternative to chlorine. In order to improve the cost-effectiveness of thymol-based washing solutions, formulas of THY with combination of organic acid or surfactant were developed and their efficacies to reduce Salmonella on chicken breast were investigated in the current study. Surface-inoculated chicken breasts were washed with the two thymol-based washing solutions: 0.2 mg/mL THY+5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)+2 mg/mL acetic acid (AA) or 0.2 mg/mL THY+2 mg/mL AA for 2 min. Both solutions achieved around 2.2 log reductions of Salmonella on chicken breast and their efficacy was comparable to log reduction obtained by 200 ppm chlorine washing. Addition of SDS did not result in more log reduction of Salmonella on chicken meat samples. More than 3.3 log reduction in the used THY washing solutions was determined and it was similar to log reduction from the spent chlorine solution. None of these antimicrobial agents changed the pH and texture values of chicken breasts. Therefore, 0.2 mg/mL THY+2 mg/mL AA has great potential to be a natural alternative to chlorine-based washing solution for reducing Salmonella contamination on chicken breast meat.", "label": 1}

In this work, the performance of a modified Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) surface designated by SICON (a-C:H:Si:O) was compared with stainless steel (316L) regarding bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation and cleanability. Assays were performed at different temps. using Escherichia coli, one of the most persistent foodborne microorganisms and also the natural flora present in the water from an industrial salad washing line. Bacterial adhesion on SICON and stainless steel were similar and favored at a higher temp. (30 \u00b0C). Biofilm formation was reduced on SICON (1-2 Log) and this may be explained by the lower ratio between the Lifshitz-van der Waals apolar component and the electron donor component (?LW/?-) of this surface. It was also shown that after performing a cleaning treatment with chlorine, redn. of viability counts was much higher in SICON (about 3.5 Log redn. and 15% removal) when compared to stainless steel (1.6 Log redn. and 6% removal).

The effectiveness of rewashing for inactivation of E. coli O157:H7 on newly cross-contaminated produce previously washed with solutions containing an insufficient amount of chlorine also was assessed. Results indicate that solutions containing a minimum of 0.5 mg/liter free chlorine were effective for inactivating E. coli O157:H7 in suspension to below the detection level. However, the presence of 1 mg/liter free chlorine in the wash solution before washing was insufficient to prevent E. coli O157:H7 survival and transfer during washing because the introduction of cut lettuce to the wash system quickly depleted the free chlorine. Although no E. coli O157:H7 was detected in the wash solution containing 5 mg/liter free chlorine before washing a mix of inoculated and uninoculated lettuce, low numbers of E. coli O157:H7 cells were detected on uninoculated lettuce in four of the seven experimental trials. When the prewash free chlorine concentration was increased to 10 mg/liter or greater, no E. coli O157:H7 transfer was detected. Furthermore, although rewashing newly cross-contaminated lettuce in 50 mg/liter free chlorine for 30 s significantly reduced (P = 0.002) the E. coli O157:H7 populations, it failed to eliminate E. coli O157:H7 on lettuce.

MAb titers were 512,000 to homologous venom, between 2000 and 64,000 for L. intermedia venom and between 1000 and 64,000 for L. laeta venom. By Western blotting, MAbs could recognize mainly the 35 kDa protein of L. gaucho venom and with less intensity the 35 kDa protein of L. intermedia venom. These MAbs also recognized weakly or did not recognize the 32 kDa component of L. laeta venom. Only MoALg1 showed high affinity for L. gaucho venom and neutralized in vivo 90\u201397% of the dermonecrotic activity, besides delaying the lethality induced by homologous venom. MoALg1 maintained its capacity to neutralize the dermonecrotic activity, even when administered (i.v.) 6 h after envenoming (i.d.). All MAbs obtained failed to neutralize the toxic activities of the heterologous venoms. These results suggest that different epitopes are present in the protein responsible for the dermonecrotic activity of Loxosceles venoms, and confirm the participation of other venom components during the local reaction process.

The homodimer native enzyme structure, solved to 1.40 \u00c5 resolution, is a (??)8 barrel, characteristic of members of the amidohydrolase superfamily. TrzN uniquely positions threonine 325 in place of a conserved aspartate that ligates the metal in most mononuclear amidohydrolases superfamily members. The threonine side chain oxygen atom is 3.3 \u00c5 from the zinc atom and 2.6 \u00c5 from the oxygen atom of zinc-coordinated water. Mutation of the threonine to a serine resulted in a 12-fold decrease in kcat/Km, largely due to kcat, whereas the T325D and T325E mutants had immeasurable activity. The structure and kinetics of TrzN are reminiscent of carbonic anhydrase, which uses a threonine to assist in positioning water for reaction with carbon dioxide. An isosteric substitution in the active site glutamate, E241Q, showed a large diminution in activity with ametryn, no detectable activity with atratone, and a 10-fold decrease with atrazine, when compared with wild-type TrzN. Activity with the E241Q mutant was nearly constant from pH 6.0 to 10.0, consistent with the loss of a proton-donating group. Structures for TrzN-E241Q were solved with bound ametryn and atratone to 1.93 and 1.64 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. Both structure and kinetic determinations suggest that the Glu241 side chain provides a proton to N-1 of the s-triazine substrate to facilitate nucleophilic displacement at the adjacent C-2. \u00a9 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.", "label": 0}

Here, we review the role of poultry as a source and reservoir for Campylobacter. Contamination and subsequent colonization of broiler flocks at the farm level often lead to transmission of Campylobacter along the poultry production chain and contamination of poultry meat at retail. Yet Campylobacter prevalence in poultry, as well as the contamination level of poultry products, vary greatly between different countries so there are differences in the intervention strategies that need to be applied. Temporal patterns in poultry do not always coincide with those found in human infections. Studies in rural and urban areas have revealed differences in Campylobacter infections attributed to poultry, as poultry seems to be the predominant reservoir in urban, but not necessarily in rural, settings. Furthermore, foreign travel is considered a major risk factor in acquiring the disease, especially for individuals living in the northern European countries. Intervention strategies aimed at reducing Campylobacter colonization in poultry and focused at the farm level have been successful in reducing the number of Campylobacter cases in several countries. Increasing farm biosecurity and education of consumers are likely to limit the risk of infection. Overall, poultry is an important reservoir and source of human campylobacteriosis, although the contribution of other sources, reservoirs and transmission warrants more research.", "label": 0}

The combination of irrigants and their interaction sometimes could be detrimental to the outcome of the root canal therapy. The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate the interaction between 7% maleic acid (MA) and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution (CHX) and to find out the availability of individual irrigant and (2) to determine the free available chlorine content when 7% MA was mixed with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution. Methods Interaction between MA and CHX was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Available chlorine content in NaOCl was evaluated by the standard iodine/thiosulfate titration method. Results It was observed that more than 90% free MA and CHX were available when MA was combined with CHX. It was also observed that there was no precipitate formation when 7% MA was mixed with 2% CHX. Available chlorine content decreased significantly in the MA/NaOCl mixture.

Two matched analyses of a subset of 200 participants who completed both surveys had similar results. Reported exposures to blood, presumably infectious blood, sputum, presumably infectious sputum, and urine were significantly decreased. Participants were tested for antibodies to HIV-1; no participant reporting cutaneous exposures acquired HIV-1 infection. The upper bound for the 95% confidence interval for the risk of HIV-1 infection associated with a single cutaneous exposure was 0.04% for blood presumed to contain HIV-1 and 0.02% for any body substance presumed to contain HIV-I. conclusions: These data suggest that Universal Precautions training significantly decreased but did not eliminate cutaneous exposures to blood and body substances. The results further suggest that the risk for HIV-1 infection associated with cutaneous exposures is substantially lower than the risk associated with parenteral exposures.", "label": 0}

{"id": "9291", "title": "Engineering aspects of ferrate in water and wastewater treatment - a review", "abstract": "There is renewed interest in the tetra-oxy compound of +6 oxidation states of iron, ferrate(VI) ((FeO42-)-O-VI), commonly called ferrate. Ferrate has the potential in cleaner (\"greener\") technologies for water treatment and remediation processes, as it produces potentially less toxic byproducts than other treatment chemicals (e.g., chlorine). Ferrate has strong potential to oxidize a number of contaminants, including sulfur- and nitrogen-containing compounds, estrogens, and antibiotics. This oxidation capability of ferrate combines with its efficient disinfection and coagulation properties as a multi-purpose treatment chemical in a single dose. This review focuses on the engineering aspects of ferrate use at the pilot scale to remove contaminants in and enhance physical treatment of water and wastewater. In most of the pilot-scale studies, in-line and on-line electrochemical ferrate syntheses have been applied. In this ferrate synthesis, ferrate was directly prepared in solution from an iron anode, followed by direct addition to the contaminant stream. Some older studies applied ferrate as a solid. This review presents examples of removing a range of contaminants by adding ferrate solution to the stream. Results showed that ferrate alone and in combination with additional coagulants can reduce total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and organic matter. Ferrate also oxidizes cyanide, sulfide, arsenic, phenols, anilines, and dyes and disinfects a variety of viruses and bacteria. Limitations and drawbacks of the application of ferrate in treating contaminated water on the pilot scale are also presented.", "label": 0}

On the other hand, EO water with ACC of 30 and 50 mg/L was applied to spray sprouts during seed sprouting and the antimicrobial efficacy of EO water, as well as length, gross wt. and dry wt. of sprout were evaluated. The results showed that the population of natural microbiota decreased with increasing ACC of EO water, while no significant difference was obsd. among EO waters with different pH levels that were applied while soaking the seeds. EO water with higher ACC and lower pH slightly reduced the germination percentage of radish seed during seed soaking. EO waters with ACC of 30 and 50 mg/L sprayed during seed sprouting resulted in 1.39 and 1.58 log redns. of total aerobic bacteria, yeast and mold, resp., and improved the length, gross wt. and dry wt. of the sprouts. Therefore, EO water with low ACC and near neutral pH could be used to soak seeds and water sprouts throughout seed germination and sprouting to control the population of natural microbiota on seeds and sprouts.

Water disinfection may be a possible soln. to minimize AR spread but conventional processes, such as chlorination, result in the formation of dangerous disinfection byproducts. In this study advanced oxidn. processes (AOPs), namely H2O2/UV, TiO2/UV and N-TiO2/UV, have been compared with chlorination in the inactivation of an AR Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain in surface water. TiO2 P25 and nitrogen doped TiO2 (N-TiO2), prepd. by sol-gel method at two different synthesis temps. (0 and - 20 \u00b0C), were investigated in heterogeneous photocatalysis expts. Under the investigated conditions, chlorination (1.0 mg L- 1) was the faster process (2.5 min) to achieve total inactivation (6 Log). Among AOPs, H2O2/UV resulted in the best inactivation rate: total inactivation (6 Log) was achieved in 45 min treatment. Total inactivation was not obsd.

Substratum coupons are frequently re-used in fouling and cleaning experiments. When used stainless steel (2B finish) substrata were stained using fluorescent dye, organic material was detected, and the surface topography of the substratum was reduced as the accumulating soil filled grain boundaries, indicating different behaviour of microorganisms and organic material on the surface. Few attempts have been made to assess the presence of both microorganisms and other material on hygienic surfaces, although for reasons given above, this should certainly be considered. Differential fluorescent staining and assessment of the contribution of both components to surface coverage provides a relatively simple method. The effect of a protein film (bovine serum albumin; BSA) on the retention on and removal of Staphylococcus aureus from titanium surfaces with defined topographical features (pits 0.2?\u20132.0? diameter) was monitored. Surfaces were spray-cleaned with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). Cells were more easily removed from surfaces than organic material. For features which were larger than the S. aureus cells (i.e. 2 ?m diameter), cells were easily removed by cleaning, but in the presence of BSA, cells were retained at significant levels. The presence of organic material on surfaces alters their cleanability and should be monitored along with the presence of microbial cells during cleaning and sanitising regimes.", "label": 0}

With the high ambient temperatures experienced in Singapore, the operating environment in water distribution systems is expected to be more conducive to biofilm development. We have recently conducted a survey on biofilms potentially present in a local water distribution system. The survey results indicated that residual chlorine (\u00b1 standard deviation) decreased from 1.49 \u00b1 0.61 mg/l (water plant outlets) to 0.82 \u00b1 0.21 mg/l (block pipes) or 0.18 \u00b1 0.06 mg/l (unit pipes), respectively. Consumed chlorine, instead of residual chlorine, was found to be correlated with biofilm bacterial population. Assimilable organic carbon (AOC) level was 160 \u00b1 66 ?g acetate C/l, and AOC:PO4-P:NO3-N was about 8:13:1. Carbon source seemed to be the limiting nutrient for bacterial growth. The concentration of iron increased from < 0.04 mg/l (water plant outlets) to 0.22 \u00b1 0.10 mg/l (all sites). All samples showed negative results in a coliform test.

The performance of the membrane was evaluated in nanofiltration studies, and the effect on performance of experimental parameters including the NaAlg/PVA blend ratio, cross linking reaction time, membrane thickness and operating, time was investigated. The permeance properties of the membrane were determined using 2000 ppm solutions of NaCl and MgSO4. A water flux of 80 L/m(2).h with 46% salt rejection was observed for the monovalent salt solution.

METHODS: Environmental sampling of surfaces was undertaken anytime before disinfection and 1 hour after disinfection utilizing a sodium dichloroisocyanurate-based, 3-staged protocol (phase 1) or benzalkonium chloride-based, single-stage clean (phase 2). VRE colonization and infection rates are presented from 2010 to 2011, and audits of cleaning completeness were also analyzed. RESULTS: Environmental samples collected before disinfection were significantly more likely to be contaminated with VRE during phase 1 than phase 2: 25.2% versus 4.6%, respectively; odds ratio (OR), 7.01 (P < .01). Environmental samples collected after disinfection were also significantly more likely to yield VRE during phase 1 compared with phase 2: 11.2% versus 1.1%, respectively; OR, 11.73 (P < .01). Rates of VRE colonization were higher during 2010 than 2011. Cleaning audits showed similar results over both time periods. CONCLUSION: During use of a chlorine-based, 3-staged protocol, significantly higher residual levels of VRE contamination were identified, compared with levels detected during use of a benzalkonium chloride-based product for disinfection. This reduction in VRE may be due to a new disinfection product, more attention to the thoroughness of cleaning, or other supplementary efforts in our institution.", "label": 0}

Chief among these are the hepatitis viruses, particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), both of which are significantly more widespread than HIV. Although radiology is not traditionally thought of as a field with significant risk for exposure to or transmission of pathogens, the expanding role of interventional procedures in recent years belies that perception. The potential for exposure to blood or other possibly infectious material exists in virtually any invasive radiological procedure, from arteriography to image-guided biopsy. Fortunately, the risk of such exposure is low, and the risk of actual transmission of a bloodborne pathogen, whether from patient to healthcare worker or vice versa, is even lower. Nevertheless, it is important for all radiologists who perform invasive procedures to be aware of these risks and to observe pertinent safety and infection control recommendations.

The treatment methods identified included ponds, activated sludge and trickling filters. The reduction of turbidity by the plants varied between 6.2 and 99.6% while conductivity, pH and temperature varied slightly between the influent and the effluent wastewater. Thirteen (92.8%) of the plants used chlorine for disinfection of the final effluent, however only 2 (14.2%) of the plants managed to produce effluent with 0 (zero) faecal coliforms per 100 m?. Common pathogenic bacteria isolated from the final effluent included Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia coli, Vibrio spp. and Enterococcus spp. The final effluent was used for irrigation and recycling purposes in 4 plants, all the other treatment plants discharged the effluent into the river or to the environment.

Unique 2D flake-like Bi2O3 hierarchical nanostructures were grown onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate by a simple chemical bath deposition method using triethanolamine as complexing agent. The formation of Bi2O3 on FTO was governed by the decomposition of a nucleated bismuth-hydroxyl complex (Bi2O1)(x)(OH)x) and modification to the electrode was carried out by the deposition of Ag via a chemical reduction method using hydrazine hydrate. Both the fabricated electrodes were well characterized for their photo-and electro-optical properties. Efficient charge separation was observed due to the surface plasmon resonance phenomenon of silver nanoparticles with the favorable intrinsic properties of Bi2O3 under application of a small electric bias of 1 V preventing the recombination of charge carriers and thereby increasing the rate of photoelectrocatalytic degradation of the chlorinated phenols. PEC degradation using the Ag@Bi2O3 photoelectrode followed the trend 4-CP o 2,4-DCP o 2,4,6-TCP o P-CP due to efficient attack at the chlorinated positions by reactive oxygen species with increasing chlorine substitution and also due to the absence of an expected Ag@Bi2O3 was 1.5 times higher than a Bi2O3 nanoflake electrode for 4-CP over 2 h. The fabricated Ag@Bi2O3 proved to be an efficient photoelectrode with synergistic solar-induced photoactivity. A detailed mechanistic study in the presence of scavengers suggests degradation by produced hydroxyl radical species. Thus, physical insights into the degradation of chlorinated phenols were obtained.", "label": 0}

This study investigated a system using a combination of heating and transient application of ethanol to reduce bacterial load. This approach used a small scale heat-spray and heat-double spray process that included a two factor block design with heat (25\u00b12\u00a0\u00b0C and 125\u00b12\u00a0\u00b0C) and spray levels (0,1,2); One factor design with nut levels of almonds, pistachios, pecans, and walnuts for each heat-spray and heat-double spray process; a two factor experiment included a dip contact time (5s, 1800s) and ethanol evaporation time (5\u00a0s, 1800\u00a0s). Also, to evaluate the interaction of a heat-spray process on moisture content of almonds, a two factor design with levels of heat (25\u00b12\u00a0\u00b0C and 125\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C) and spray (0,1) was used. Additionally, the spray evaporation rate was evaluated. The heat-spray process shows additivity, while the heat-double spray process shows synergism. The heat-double spray process on almonds achieved a 6.1 mean log10\u00a0CFU/g reduction of Salmonella that was 35% higher than that of the heat-spray. For other nuts, the heat-double spray process led to a 4.8, 3.0, and 4.0 log10 reduction for pecan, pistachio, and walnut, respectively. The dip time (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05) had a greater effect than ethanol evaporation (p\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.05) on log10 reduction of Salmonella in almonds. By applying ethanol 70%, the moisture increases by ?0.5% w.b., whereas applying temperature decreases moisture by ?2% w.b. The implication of these findings is that both the heat-spray and heat-double-spray process may be alternatives to the current almond disinfection processes in achieving a high log10 reduction.", "label": 0}

Defining the relationship between in vitro viability assays and oocyst infectivity in susceptible hosts is critical for determining the significance of existing oocyst inactivation data for these in vitro assays and their suitability in future studies. In this study, four viability assays were compared with mouse infectivity assays, using neonatal CD-1 mice. Studies were conducted in the United States and United Kingdom using fresh (<1 month) or environmentally aged (3 months at 4 degrees C) oocysts, which were partially inactivated by ozonation before viability and/or infectivity analyses. High levels of variability were noted within and between the viability and infectivity assays in the U.S. and United Kingdom studies despite rigorous control over oocyst conditions and disinfection experiments. Based on the viability analysis of oocyst subsamples from each ozonation experiment, SYTO-59 assays demonstrated minimal change in oocyst viability, whereas 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole-propidium iodide assays, in vitro excystation, and SYTO-9 assays showed a marginal reduction in oocyst viability. In contrast, the neonatal mouse infectivity assay demonstrated significantly higher levels of oocyst inactivation in the U.S. and United Kingdom experiments. These comparisons illustrate that four in vitro viability assays cannot be used to reliably predict oocyst inactivation following treatment with low levels of ozone. Neonatal mouse infectivity assays should continue to be regarded as a \"gold standard\" until suitable alternative viability surrogates are identified for disinfection studies.", "label": 0}

Before the elucidation of the three-dimensional structures of maize C4 leaf and Escherichia coli PEPC, our truncation analysis of the sorghum C4 homologue revealed important roles for the enzyme's C-terminal ?-helix and its appended QNTG961 tetrapeptide in polypeptide stability and overall catalysis, respectively. Collectively, these functional and structural observations implicate the importance of the PEPC C-terminal tetrapeptide for both catalysis and negative allosteric regulation. We have now more finely dissected this element of PEPC structure-function by modification of the absolutely conserved C-terminal glycine of the sorghum C4 isoform by site-specific mutagenesis (G961(A/V/D)) and truncation (?C1/C4). Although the C4 polypeptide failed to accumulate in a PEPC-strain(XH11) of E. coli transformed with the Asp mutant, the other variants were produced at wild-type levels. Although neither of these four mutants displayed an apparent destabilization of the purified PEPC homotetramer, all were compromised catalytically in vivo and in vitro. Functional complementation of XH11 cells under selective growth conditions was restricted progressively by the Ala, ?C1 and Val, and ?C4 modifications. Likewise, steady-state kinetic analysis of the purified mutant enzymes revealed corresponding negative trends in kcat and kcat/K0.5 (phosphoenolpyruvate) but not in K0.5 or the Hill coefficient. Homology modeling of these sorghum C-terminal variants against the structure of the closely related maize C4 isoform predicted perturbations in active-site molecular cavities and/or ion-pairing with essential, invariant Arg-638. These collective observations reveal that even a modest, neutral alteration of the PEPC C-terminal hydrogen atom side chain is detrimental to enzyme function. \u00a9 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.", "label": 0}

Candida species are the most common fungi isolated from these infections, and biofilms formed by these fungal organisms are associated with drastically enhanced resistance against most antimicrobial agents. This enhanced resistance contributes to the persistence of this fungus despite antifungal therapy. Candida biofilms exhibit enhanced resistance against most antifungal agents, except echinocandins and lipid formulations of AmB. The expression of drug efflux pumps during the early phase of biofilm formation and alterations in membrane sterol composition contribute to resistance of these biofilms against azoles. Metabolic dormancy and ECM do not appear to contribute to resistance, although in a mixed-species biofilm, ECM does retard the diffusion of drugs across biofilm. These multifactorial mechanisms of resistance in fungal biofilms constitute a broad-spectrum defense that is effective against many types of antifungal agents, and represent a common theme present across microbial biofilms.", "label": 0}

Additional studies were performed to examine factors that influenced the concentration of RFC from chlorine-based (sodium dichloroisocyanurate) disinfecting agents in contact with CF sputum and their components (bacterial cells, glycocalyx) to assess the reduction of the bactericidal activity of such disinfecting agents. Pseudomonas glycocalyx had a greater inhibitory effect of chlorine deactivation than bacterial cells. Calibration curves demonstrated the relative deactivating capacity on RFC from clinical soils, in the order pus>CF sputum>wound discharge fluid/synovial fluid>ascites fluid>bile, where quantitatively each 1 % (w/v) CF sputum reduced the RFC by 43 p.p.m. Sublethal stressing of P. aeruginosa with chlorine resulted in lowered susceptibility to colistin (P = 0.0326) but not to meropenem, tobramycin or ciprofloxacin. In conclusion, heavy contamination of healthcare fomites with CF sputum containing MDR P. aeruginosa may result in exhaustion of RFC, and this, combined with an increased resistance to chlorine with such strains, may lead to their survival and increased antibiotic resistance in such environments. CF infection prevention strategies in such scenarios should therefore target interventions with increased concentrations of chlorine to ensure the eradication of MDR P. aeruginosa from the CF healthcare environment.", "label": 0}

Amoebae were isolated by culture in nonnutritive agar medium combined with Escherichia coli. Identification of the isolates was done by morphology using specialized taxonomic keys and by isoelectric focusing of total proteins and isoenzymes in agarose. Pathogenicity of the isolates was determined in 3-week-old mice by intracerebral and intranasal inoculations. Statistical tools were used to determine the existence of significant differences on the incidence and diversity of the isolates in relation to the two types of water bodies analyzed. Water and environmental temperatures, pH, and chloride concentrations were determined at each sampling site. Twenty-nine amoebic strains from eight genera were isolated. Most frequently found were specimens of the genera (Acanthamoeba (with four pathogenic strains), Vahlkampfia, Hartmannella, and Naegleria. Amoebae were isolated more frequently in spring and summer, and could not be recovered from pools with chloride levels of 5.31 mg/ml or more. This survey demonstrates that chloride concentrations commonly used in recreative pools and therapy tubs are not sufficient to eliminate viable cysts of most free-living amoebae. Significantly higher numbers of isolates were retrieved from the pools than from the tubs.", "label": 1}

In this work, a hydantoin derivative, 3-monomethylol-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (MDMH), was grafted onto the nascent aromatic polyamide membrane surfaces by the reactions with active groups (e.g., acyl chloride groups) in the surfaces. The grafted MDMH moieties with high reaction activity and free chlorine could play as sacrificial pendant groups when membranes suffer from chlorine attacks, and the chlorination products N-halamines with strong antimicrobial function could sterilize microorganisms on membrane surfaces and then regenerate to MDMH. This was designed as a novel means to improve both chlorine resistances and anti-biofouling properties of the aromatic polyamide TFC RO membranes. Attenuated total reflectance mode Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) revealed that the MDMH-modified membranes had two characteristic bands at 1772 and 1709 cm-1 corresponding to two carbonyl groups in hydantoin ring. This suggested the successful grafting of MDMH onto the membrane surfaces, which was further confirmed and quantified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. After modification with MDMH, the membrane surface hydrophilicity increased obviously as contact angles decreased from 57.7\u00b0 to 50.4-31.5\u00b0. But, there was no obvious change in membrane surface roughness after modification. The MDMH-modified membranes were shown to possess high chlorine resistances with small changes in water fluxes and salt rejections after chlorination with 100-2000 ppm h chlorine at pH 4. The chlorinated MDMH-modified membranes demonstrated obvious sterilization effects on Escherchia coli and substantial preventions against microbial fouling. Therefore, the MDMH-modified membranes offer a potential use as a new type of chlorine resistance and anti-biofouling TFC RO membranes. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "label": 0}

The objective of this work was to test the effectiveness of the strain CPA-7 of Pseudomonas graminis against a cocktail of Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes on fresh-cut melon, and evaluate its effect on its quality during shelf-life when tested in conditions simulating commercial application. Fresh-cut melon was artificially inoculated with Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes and with or without the biopreservative strain at different concentrations and stored at 20, 10 and 5 \u00b0C. Moreover, the effect of the strain was tested in conditions simulating commercial application. Fresh-cut melon was packaged using passive modified atmosphere (MAP) and AIR conditions and stored at 5 and 10 \u00b0C. Quality of fresh-cut melon was evaluated in CPA-7 treated and untreated samples. At laboratory scale trials, P. graminis reduced Salmonella and L. monocytogenes growth on fresh-cut melon stored at 5, 10 and 20 \u00b0C. Effectiveness depended on their concentration and on storage temperature. At low pathogen concentration and 20 \u00b0C, L. monocytogenes growth was reduced between 2.1 and 5.3 log cfu g?1 units after 2 days of storage and Salmonella growth between 2.0 and 7.3 log cfu g?1 depending on CPA-7 dose. At 10 \u00b0C, similar reductions of pathogens were observed after 5 days of storage. In studies simulating commercial conditions, packaging atmosphere and temperature influenced P. graminis effectiveness, with better results in samples packaged under AIR conditions and 10 \u00b0C. Reduction of pathogen growth was &lt;1-log unit in fresh-cut melon stored in MAP whilst it was &gt;4-log units in AIR. Soluble solids content, titratable acidity, pH and firmness of fresh-cut melon were not significantly different in CPA-7 treated and untreated (control) melon.

Better understanding of produce decontamination is essential to support industry in assuring the safety of fruit and vegetable products, thus contributing to consumer health protection. The purpose of this study was to establish the current state of knowledge on industrial produce decontamination techniques and to identify and prioritise research gaps regarding practical and effective mechanisms to reduce microbial loading of produce with particular reference to industrially cut, washed and prepared fresh produce. Using suitable keywords, a literature review was executed using academic databases and industry sources to identify current literature on different decontamination technologies. Efficacy of approaches was compared to that of chlorine washing, the most common decontamination method used by the fresh produce industry. Findings indicate that the identified technologies had varying efficacy of microbiological reduction when compared to chlorine, and the reductions achievable across a range of methods are limited, giving rise to food safety concerns. In addition, the results demonstrate that there has been limited consideration given to several key factors, namely industrial application of the technology approaches, organoleptic acceptability of the product, whether the microbiological reduction could be sustained throughout the life of the product and consumer acceptability of the technology. This preliminary study has highlighted concerns about the efficacy of existing produce decontamination techniques and identified research gaps regarding efficacy and industrial application of new decontamination technologies.", "label": 1}
{"id": "1028", "title": "Biological mechanisms for nutritional regulation of maternal health and fetal development", "abstract": "This review paper highlights mechanisms for nutritional regulation of maternal health and fetal development. Malnutrition (nutrient deficiencies or obesity) in pregnant women adversely affects their health by causing or exacerbating a plethora of problems, such as anaemia, maternal haemorrhage, insulin resistance, and hypertensive disorders (e.g. pre-eclampsia/eclampsia). Maternal malnutrition during gestation also impairs embryonic and fetal growth and development, resulting in deleterious outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), low birthweight, preterm birth, and birth defects (e.g. neural tube defects and iodine deficiency disorders). IUGR and preterm birth contribute to high rates of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Major common mechanisms responsible for malnutrition-induced IUGR and preterm birth include: (i) abnormal growth and development of the placenta; (ii) impaired placental transfer of nutrients from mother to fetus; (iii) endocrine disorders; and (iv) disturbances in normal metabolic processes. Activation of a series of physiological responses leading to premature and sustained contraction of the uterine myometrium also results in preterm birth. Recent epidemiologic studies have suggested a link between IUGR and chronic metabolic disease in children and adults, and the effects of IUGR may be carried forward to subsequent generations through epigenetics. While advanced medical therapies, which are generally unavailable in low-income countries, are required to support preterm and IUGR infants, optimal nutrition during pregnancy may help ameliorate many of these problems. Future studies are necessary to develop effective nutritional interventions to enhance fetal growth and development and alleviate the burden of maternal morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries. \u00a9 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.", "label": 0}

Sixty-five percent of studies was conducted in the USA, Canada, or Europe. Over 70% of all studies investigated lettuce. Collectively, four leafy greens (lettuce, cabbage, spinach, and fresh leafy herbs) and microorganism (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Listeria and coliforms) combinations accounted for almost 80% of relevant studies. Forty-one percent of the research was conducted at the processing stage of production. Lack of reporting sufficient data and/or replicable laboratory protocols (first phase assessment) resulted in exclusion of 60% of relevant articles. In total, 231 papers were retained following second phase quality evaluation, and only 152 (20% of all relevant articles) met\u00a0all ranking criteria. A lack of well designed, executed, and reported prevalence studies with sampled populations representative of the target populations and of experimental studies investigating the efficacy of intervention(s) under real-life conditions was observed. A limited number of articles investigating commonly accepted important risk factors, for example worker hygiene and health, equipment sanitation, and wildlife, was identified. We highlight research areas with the data potentially feasible for full systematic review-meta-analysis methodology and areas warranting additional investigation. The resulting information is necessary for the establishment of evidence-informed guidelines for food safety enhancement.", "label": 1}

The objectives of this study were to microscopically diagnose the presence of Cryptosporidium in birds from a commercial aviary located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; genotypically characterize species and/or genotypes of genus Cryptosporidum; and conduct sequencing and phylogenetic analyses to compare the obtained DNA sequences with those deposited in GenBank. A total of 85 fecal samples were collected from wild captive-bred birds: 48 of family Psittacidae and 37 of family Ramphastidae. Initially, a search for the presence of Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts was conducted using the centrifugal-flotation in saturated sugar solution technique, after that, the collected samples were analyzed microscopically. Cryptosporidium infections were only detected in 24.32% of samples belonging to the family Ramphastidae. DNA was extracted from positive samples and molecular diagnostics was applied targeting the 18S rRNA gene, followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The Cryptosporidium Avian genotype III was diagnosed in this study more closely related to the gastric species. This is the first record of Cryptosporidium Avian genotype III in order Piciformes and family Ramphastidae, where three host species (Ramphastus toco, Ramphastus tucanus, and Pteroglossus bailloni) were positive for the etiologic agent. Based on the molecular data obtained, these wild birds raised in captivity do not represent a source of human cryptosporidiosis, considering that Cryptosporidium Avian genotype III does not constitute a zoonosis.", "label": 0}

Cells and spores were incubated in a liq. dishwashing detergent for 16 to 18 h before treatment with sanitizers. At 50 ?g/mL, chlorine dioxide killed a significantly higher no. of Pseudomonas cells (3.82 log CFU/mL) than did chlorine (a redn. of 1.34 log CFU/mL). Stainless steel coupons were spot inoculated with Pseudomonas cells and B. cereus cells and spores, with water and 5% horse serum as carriers. Chlorine was more effective than chlorine dioxide in killing cells and spores of B. cereus suspended in horse serum. B. cereus biofilm on stainless steel coupons that were treated with chlorine dioxide or chlorine at 200 ?g/mL had total population redns. (vegetative cells plus spores) of ?4.42 log CFU per coupon; the no. of spores was reduced by ?3.80 log CFU per coupon. Fit (0.5%) was ineffective for killing spot-inoculated B. cereus and B. cereus in biofilm, but treatment with mixts. of Fit and chlorine dioxide caused greater redns. than did treatment with chlorine dioxide alone. In contrast, when chlorine was combined with Fit, the lethality of chlorine was completely lost. This study provides information on the survival and sanitizer sensitivity of Pseudomonas and B. cereus in a liq. dishwashing detergent, on the surface of stainless steel, and in a biofilm. This information will be useful for developing more effective strategies for cleaning and sanitizing contact surfaces in food prepn. and processing environments. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}

In the course of nine visits to a local processing plant we collected a total of 121 samples: 66 from carcasses, 37 from workers' hands and gloves and 18 from the water used for chilling. Except for the water samples Listeria was isolated at all sampling sites. The species most often isolated was Listeria innocua, which accounted for 28 of the 31 (90.3%) isolates. The frequency of Listeria in the chicken carcasses was similar at bleeding, defeathering and end of evisceration stages (33.3%), reduced during scalding (16.7%), and rose immediately after initial evisceration stage (50%) to peak after packaging (76.2%). The carcasses were contaminated by L. monocytogenes serotypes 1b and 1c only during packaging. The prevalence of Listeria spp. on workers' hands and gloves was 46% mostly with L. innocua (40.5%) followed by L. monocytogenes 1b (11.8%). Chilling water presented more than 100 ppm of chlorine, which could explain why the samples were negative to Listeria. As the contamination by Listeria in the carcasses progressively rose both in number, species and strains during processing it seems reasonable to conclude that those carcasses become contaminated at the processing level. Improvement and innovation measures to control bacteria in general at the processing plant level are necessary to effectively reduce final product contamination by L. monocytogenes. In the course of this work we introduced a bacteriophage susceptibility test to confirm suspected Listeria colonies which was able to reduce the time of analysis to a minimum of 30 h depending on the isolation technique employed.", "label": 1}

{"id": "6196", "title": "Inactivation kinetics of cold oxygen plasma depend on incubation conditions of Aeromonas hydrophila biofilm on lettuce", "abstract": "Disease outbreaks from fresh produce have been increasing as a result of the increasing global consumption of produce. We evaluated the efficiency of cold oxygen plasma (COP), a new technology for the decontamination of fresh produce, in reducing biofilm of Aeromonas hydrophila, an emerging food-borne pathogen on lettuce. Lettuce leaves were inoculated with A. hydrophila at different temperatures to form biofilm and planktonic populations, and the inactivation kinetics of COP were determined using a modified Weibull model. To elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of COP, we used field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and a quorum sensing (QS) assay. We found that 5 min of treatment with COP significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced the biofilm populations of A. hydrophila on lettuce by 5.0-log incubation at lower than 15 \u00b0C, whereas biofilm populations displayed enhanced resistance to COP treatment at higher temperatures (? 15 \u00b0C). Planktonic populations also decreased by &gt; 5.0-log within 15 s treatment of COP by incubating at any temperature. The mean Td-values for a 5-log reduction (analogous to the traditional D-value) ranged from 4.4\u20138.1 s and 1.84\u201325.33 min for the planktonic and biofilm populations, respectively. However, higher temperatures (? 15 \u00b0C) resulted in a significantly higher QS (p &lt; 0.05) as well as biofilm formation and internalization in stomata, suggesting that higher biofilm formation and internalization might be the main factors mediating resistance to COP. In summary, this study highlights the impact of temperature on the modulation of QS, biofilm formation, internalization, and COP resistance in lettuce.", "label": 0}
{"id": "6355", "title": "Arylamino methylene bisphosphonate derivatives as bone seeking matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors", "abstract": "The complexity of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs) design derives from the difficulty in carefully addressing their inhibitory activity towards the MMP isoforms involved in many pathological conditions. In particular, specific metalloproteinases, such as MMP-2 and MMP-9, are key regulators of the \u2018vicious cycle\u2019 occurring between tumor metastases growth and bone remodeling. In an attempt to devise new approaches to selective inhibitor derivatives, we describe novel bisphosphonate bone seeking MMP inhibitors (BP-MMPIs), capable to be selectively targeted and to overcome undesired side effects of broad spectrum MMPIs. In vitro activity (IC50 values) for each inhibitor was determined against MMP-2, -8, -9 and -14, because of their relevant role in skeletal development and renewal. The results show that BP-MMPIs reached IC50 values of enzymatic inhibition in the low micromolar range. Computational studies, used to rationalize some trends in the observed inhibitory profiles, suggest a possible differential binding mode in MMP-2 that explains the selective inhibition of this isoform. In addition, survival assay was conducted on J774 cell line, a well known model system used to evaluate the structure\u2013activity relationship of BPs for inhibiting bone resorption. The resulting data, confirming the specific activity of BP-MMPIs, and their additional proved propensity to bind hydroxyapatite powder in vitro, suggest a potential use of BP-MMPIs in skeletal malignancies.", "label": 0}

Mixed natural populations of coliforms from sewage, with and without chlorine exposure, and untreated surface water samples were examined following a USEPA established procedure. Colisure and LTB were examined after 20, 24, 28 and 48h incubation and reactions verified. There were slight increases in positive reactions over time with unchlorinated samples, for which the two media gave similar kinetic patterns. The increases over time with chlorinated samples were much greater than with unchlorinated samples. LTB gave significantly lower total positive responses and had a more pronounced lag period than did Colisure. Total coliform bacteria from surface water samples gave somewhat different reactions with more of an increase with time. Colisure recovered comparable or higher numbers of total coliforms and E. coli in 20-28h than LTB after 48h. These results confirm that Colisure gives improved recovery of chlorine-injured total coliforms and E. coli under conditions simulating treated drinking and source water, resulting in a more realistic estimate of the actual population of indicator bacteria in public water supplies.

Yet, their clinical usage has been associated with toxicities in the liver. While some studies have attributed toxicities to the bioactivation of both drugs to reactive intermediates, the structural predisposition for toxicity, as well as relationship between this toxicity and COX inhibitory activity has not been elucidated. In this study, we aimed to address their intricate link by synthesizing compounds that possess the 2-phenylaminophenylacetic acid backbone with varying alkyl and halogen substituents at three positions critical to the COX inhibitory pharmacophore. These compounds were subjected to cytotoxicity testing on two liver cell lines of contrasting metabolic competencies. We observed higher toxicity in the more metabolically competent cell line, supporting the role of bioactivation as a prerequisite for toxicity. We have also shown that structural changes on the chemical scaffold exerted pronounced effect on liver cytotoxicity. The most lipophilic and brominated compound (24) was identified as the most cytotoxic of all the compounds. A concurrent determination of their pharmacological activity using COX inhibition assays allowed us to derive a safety profile, which showed that selectivity towards COX-2 negatively affected activity and toxicity.", "label": 0}

In addition, clover sprouts was immersed in 0.5, 1 and 2% thyme (Thymus vulgaris) essential oil (EO) solutions, packaged in polyethylene containers and stored at refrigerated temperature (4 degrees C) for 10 days. As seedling progressed, the moisture, protein, crude fibre and ash content increased, whilst fat and carbohydrate reduced. After 4 day germination, ascorbic acid, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity indicated 1.3, 2 and 1.5 fold increase, respectively. Sprouting caused significantly (p < 0.05) increase in measured organic acids and minerals (except K). Moreover, oleic acid showed an increase of 3.4% compared to raw seed. In respect to microbial quality, the treated clover sprout demonstrated a significant reduction in the population of total aerobic bacteria, coliforms, molds and yeast count followed by increasing EO concentration compared to the control. Total aerobic bacteria, total coliforms, molds and yeast count of clover sprouts with 2% thyme EO showed 3.2, 2.3 and 2.2 logio unit reduction, just after treatment.

{"id": "8041", "title": "Disinfection of biologically treated wastewater and prevention of biofouling by UV/electrolysis hybrid technology: Influence factors and limits for domestic wastewater reuse", "abstract": "Reuse of wastewater contributes significantly to an efficient and sustainable water usage. However, due to the presence of a multitude of pathogens (e.g. bacteria, viruses, worms, protozoa) in secondary effluents, disinfection procedures are indispensable. In decentralized wastewater treatment, UV irradn. represents one of the most common disinfection methods in addn. to membrane processes and to a certain extent electrochem. procedures. However, the usage of UV disinfected secondary effluents for domestic (sanitary) or irrigation purposes bears a potential health risk due to the possible photo and dark repair of reversibly damaged bacteria. Against this background, the application of the UV/electrolysis hybrid technol. for disinfection and prevention of bacterial reactivation in biol. treated wastewater was investigated in view of relevant influence factors and operating limits. Furthermore, the influence of electrochem. generated total oxidants on the formation of biofilms on quartz glass surfaces was examd., since its preventive avoidance contributes to an enhanced operational safety of the hybrid reactor. It was found that reactivation of bacteria in UV irradiated, biol. treated wastewater can be prevented by electrochem. produced total oxidants. In this regard, the influence of the initial concn. of the microbiol. indicator organism Escherichia coli (E. coli) (9.3*102-2.2*105 per 100 mL) and the influence of total suspended solids (TSS) in the range of 11-75 mg L-1 was examd. The concn. of total oxidants necessary for prevention of bacterial regrowth increases linearly with the initial E. coli and TSS concn. At an initial concn. of 933 E. coli per 100 mL, a total oxidants concn. of 0.4 mg L-1 is necessary to avoid photo reactivation (at 4200 Lx), whereas 0.67 mg L-1 is required if the E. coli concn. is enhanced by 2.4 log levels (cTSS = const. = 13 mg L-1). The prevention of dark repair is ensured with 25-50% lower concn. of total oxidants. An increase of the TSS concn. from 11 mg L-1 to 75 mg L-1 leads to a triplication of the need of total oxidants from 0.6 mg L-1 to 1.8 mg L-1 (3*105E. coli per 100 mL). The energy consumption of the hybrid reactor varies from 0.17 kWh m-3 to 0.94 kWh m-3 depending on the TSS concn. (11-75 mg L-1). Furthermore, biofilm formation on quartz glass surfaces, of which the sleeves of UV lamps consist, can be suppressed by electrochem. produced total oxidants at a concn. of at least 1 mg L-1 which ensures high operational safety of the hybrid reactor combined with large maintenance intervals.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A unified food surface model was simulated using Bacto() agar, a routinely used microbial medium. The foodborne pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli K12 (as a surrogate for E. coli O157:H7), Salmonella Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes were inoculated onto the agar surface, followed by investigation of TUVP-assisted inactivation and morphological changes in bacterial cells. The TUVP process showed higher bacterial inactivation, particularly for Gram-negative bacteria, than UVC alone and a control (dark reaction). A TUVP treatment of 17.2 mW cm(-2) (30% lower than the UVC light intensity) reduced the microbial load on the agar surface by 4.5-6.0 log CFU cm(-2). UVC treatment of 23.7 mW cm(-2) caused 3.0-5.3 log CFU cm(-2) reduction. CONCLUSIONS: The use of agar model surface is effective for investigation of bacterial disinfection and TUVP is a promising nonthermal technique.

{"id": "179", "title": "Survival and heat resistance of Listeria monocytogenes after exposure to alkali and chlorine", "abstract": "A strain of Listeria monocytogenes isolated from a drain in a food-processing plant was demonstrated, by determination of D values, to be more resistant to the lethal effect of heat at 56 or 59 degrees C following incubation for 45 min in tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) at pH 12.0 than to that of incubation for the same time in TPB at pH 7.3. Cells survived for at least 6 days when they were suspended in TPB at pHs 9.0, 10.0, and 11.0 and stored at 4 or 21 degrees C. Cells of L. monocytogenes incubated at 37 degrees C for 45 min and then stored for 48 or 144 h in TPB at pH 10.0 were more resistant to heat treatment at 56 degrees C than were cells stored in TPB at pH 7.3. The alkaline-stress response in L. monocytogenes may induce resistance to otherwise lethal thermal-processing conditions. Treatment of cells in 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.00 +/- 0.05) containing 2.0 or 2.4 mg of free chlorine per liter reduced populations by as much as 1.3 log(10) CFU/ml, while treatment with 6.0 mg of free chlorine per liter reduced populations by as much as 4.02 log(10) CFU/ml. Remaining subpopulations of chlorine-treated cells exhibited some injury, and cells treated with chlorine for 10 min were more sensitive to heating at 56 degrees C than cells treated for 5 min. Contamination of foods by L. monocytogenes cells that have survived exposure to processing environments ineffectively cleaned or sanitized with alkaline detergents or disinfectants may have more severe implications than previously recognized. Alkaline-pH-induced cross-protection of L. monocytogenes against heat has the potential to enhance survival in minimally processed as well as in heat-and-serve foods and in foods on holding tables, in food service facilities, and in the home. Cells surviving exposure to chlorine, in contrast, are more sensitive to heat; thus, the effectiveness of thermal processing in achieving desired log(10)-unit reductions is not compromised in these cells.", "label": 1}

Broiler carcasses and chiller water were obtained from a commercial processing facility which had recently installed a TOMCO Pathogen Management System to recycle water in sections 2 and 3 of two 3-compartment chillers. In this system, reused water is blended with fresh water to maintain the chiller volume. Carcasses were sampled prechill and postchill (final exit), and chiller water was sampled from the beginning and end of each of the 3 sections. Carcasses were subjected to a whole carcass rinse (WCR) in 0.1% peptone. Numbers of Escherichia coli (EC), coliforms (CF), and Campylobacter (CPY) were determined from the WCR and chiller water samples. Prevalence of Salmonella (SAL) was also determined on the WCR and chiller water samples. On average, prechill levels of bacteria recovered from rinses were 2.6, 2.9, and 2.6 log10 cfu/mL for EC, CF, and CPY, respectively. Ten out of 40 (25%) prechill carcasses were positive for SAL. After chilling, numbers of EC, CF, and CPY recovered from carcass rinses decreased by 1.5, 1.5, and 2.0 log10 cfu/mL, respectively. However, 9 out of 40 (22%) postchill carcasses were positive for SAL. When the chiller water samples were tested, counts of EC, CF, and CPY were found only in water collected from the first section of the chiller (inlet and outlet). Two of 4 water samples collected from the inlet of the first section tested positive for SAL. This study shows that fresh and reused water can be used to cool poultry in chiller systems to achieve a reduction in numbers of bacteria (EC, CF, and CPY) or equivalent prevalence (SAL) of bacteria recovered from broiler carcasses.", "label": 1}

We demonstrated here that ClO2 gas is easily generated by mixing 3.35% sodium chlorite solution (Purogene) and 85% phosphoric acid at a 10:1 volume ratio without using an expensive machine. In a test room (87 m(3)), experiments were carried out using various amounts of sodium chlorite solution (0.25 ml/m(3) to 20.0 ml/m(3)). The gas concentration increased in a sodium chlorite volume-dependent manner and reached peak values of from 0.8 ppm to 40.8 ppm at 2 h-3 h, and then gradually decreased. No differences in gas concentrations were observed between 0.1 and 2.5 m above the floor, indicating that the gas was evenly distributed. Under high-humidity (approximately 80% relative humidity), colony formation of both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was completely inhibited by ClO2 gas exposure at 1.0 ml/m(3) sodium chlorite solution (mean maximal concentration of 3.0 ppm). Exposure at 4.0 ml/m(3) sodium chlorite solution (mean maximal concentration of 10.6 ppm) achieved complete inactivation of Bacillus atrophaeus spores. In contrast, without humidification, the efficacy of ClO2 gas was apparently attenuated, suggesting that the atmospheric moisture is indispensable. Delicate electronic devices (computer, camera, etc.) operated normally, even after being subjected to more than 20 times of fumigation.

In this study, inactivation of HRV by 0.6mg/L free chlorine was assessed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2), and tap and river water samples, using both TCID50 and RT-qPCR (VP2- and VP4-RT-qPCR) assays, respectively. Among the samples tested, the VP2-RT-qPCR method did not show significant inactivation after chlorine disinfection; however, the reduction in VP4-RT-qPCR signal was correlated with decreased HRV infectivity. Moreover, the higher sensitivity of the VP4-RT-qPCR assay allowed for assessment of chlorine HRV inactivation at longer exposure times compared with the conventional TCID50 assay. Collectively, these results indicated that the VP4-RT-qPCR assay is a rapid, sensitive, and reliable tool to detect infectious HRV following chlorine inactivation, and highlights the potential for further development of qPCR/RT-qPCR assays to provide information regarding viral infectivity from drinking water plants.", "label": 1}
{"id": "3092", "title": "Transcriptional and phenotypic responses of Listeria monocytogenes to chlorine dioxide", "abstract": "Significant food-borne disease outbreaks have occurred from consumption of ready-to-eat foods, including produce, contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Challenging food matrices (e.g., cantaloupe, sprouts) with limited processing steps postharvest to reduce pathogen loads have underscored a need for new mitigation strategies. Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is increasingly being used in produce and other food systems to reduce food-borne pathogen levels. The goal of this study was to characterize the transcriptional response and survival of L. monocytogenes 10403S exposed to ClO2. The transcriptional profile of log-phase cells exposed to 300 mg/liter ClO2 for 15 min was defined by whole-genome microarray. A total of 340 genes were significantly differentially expressed. Among the differentially expressed genes, 223 were upregulated (fold change >/= 1.5; adjusted P value < 0.05) in role categories responsible for protein fate, cellular processes, and energy metabolism. There were 113 and 16 genes differentially expressed belonging to regulatory networks of sigma(B) and CtsR, respectively. We assessed L. monocytogenes 10403S survival after exposure to 100, 300, and 500 mg/liter aqueous ClO2 in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth; there was a significant difference between cells exposed to 500 mg/liter ClO2 and those exposed to all other conditions over time (P value < 0.05). Isogenic DeltasigB and DeltactsR mutants exposed to 300 mg/liter ClO2 were more sensitive to ClO2 than the wild type under the same conditions. These results provide an initial insight into the mechanisms that L. monocytogenes employs to survive sublethal ClO2 and further our understanding of the inactivation mechanisms of this increasingly used sanitizer.", "label": 0}

The raw RO membranes were modified by free-radical graft polymerization of 3-allyl-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (ADMH) using 2,2?-azobis(isobutyramidine) dihydrochloride as an initiator. Attenuated total reflective Fourier transform infrared spectra (ATR-FTIR) verified the successful graft of ADMH on the raw membrane surfaces. It was shown that two new FTIR adsorption bands at 1770 and 1714 cm-1 corresponding to two carbonyl groups in hydantoin ring appeared after graft polymerization, and the intensities of these two bands increased with increasing grafting time. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle, and streaming potential measurements, graft polymerization increased the nitrogen and oxygen atom contents, improved surface hydrophilicity, and reduced surface charges of the raw membranes. The water fluxes of the ADMH-grafted membranes were higher than that of the raw membranes; however, the salt rejections decreased slightly. The chlorine resistances of the ADMH-grafted membranes were significantly improved by showing slight changes in water fluxes and salt rejections after chlorine treatments as compared with those of the raw membranes. Furthermore, the chlorinated ADMH-grafted membranes demonstrated obvious sterilization effects on Escherchia coli and substantial preventions against microbial fouling. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.

{"id": "7114", "title": "Do corticosteroids have a role in preventing or reducing acute toxic lung injury caused by inhalation of chemical agents?", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence that treatment with corticosteroids improves the outcome in those exposed to lung-damaging agents. METHODS: We searched Pubmed, Toxnet, Cochrane database, Google Scholar, and Embase from 1966 to January 2010 using the search terms \"steroid\", \"corticosteroid\", \"lung injury\", \"lung damage\", and \"inhalation\". These searches identified 287 papers of which 118 contained information on animal studies. However, most were reviews or case reports and only a few were controlled animal experiments of which 13 were considered relevant. ROLE OF CORTICOSTEROIDS: ANIMAL STUDIES: Corticosteroids have no beneficial effect at the alveolar level on acute lung injury, which is caused by inhalation of poorly water-soluble compounds (e.g. nitrogen dioxide, ozone, phosgene) or following severe exposure to water-soluble compounds (e.g. chlorine, ammonia). In the recovery phase, corticosteroids may even be harmful, because corticosteroids hamper the division of type II alveolar cells and hamper the differentiation from type II into type I alveolar cells. The latter is important for the re-epithelialization of the alveolus and removal of excess of water in the alveolus. Furthermore, the quality of animal studies does not always allow extrapolation to human exposures. Differences between humans and animals in anatomy, pulmonary defense systems, breathing physiology, as well as the way the animals have been exposed, and the timing and route of corticosteroids in animal studies make predictions difficult. ROLE OF CORTICOSTEROIDS: HUMAN STUDIES: An abundance of uncontrolled case reports and a few human crossover studies have evaluated the outcome of human volunteers exposed to various lung-damaging agents. Only a few reports contained systematic information on corticosteroid treatment. Data on the efficacy of corticosteroids after human exposure to lung-damaging agents are inconclusive. Often the number of patients involved is small or the severity of exposure is unclear or not well determined. These reports are therefore limited in their ability to establish a cause-effect relationship for the treatments involved. In some studies involving mild to moderate exposure to water-soluble agents (e.g. chlorine, ammonia), corticosteroid treatment was beneficial for some physiological parameters, such as airway resistance or arterial oxygen tension. However, severe lung injury and inflammation appear not to be improved by corticosteroid treatment. The optimal duration of treatment to obtain these beneficial effects has not been assessed adequately, but it only seems to be useful in the first hours after exposure. Generally, studies evaluating exposure to water-soluble compounds have too short a follow-up, which hampers the evaluation of the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment. The results of studies with longer follow-up suggest that the initial slight improvement in some variables is lost several hours after exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical data on the efficacy of corticosteroids after human exposure to lung-damaging agents are inconclusive as the number of well-structured controlled studies is small and the indications for administration of corticosteroids are unclear. There have been no human controlled studies of high-dose exposure to lung-damaging agents. Furthermore, treatment with corticosteroids is limited by the potential side effects, such as prolonged neuromuscular weakness, deregulation of glucose metabolism, superinfection, and sepsis, which could diminish the chances for recovery.", "label": 0}

The rapid viral inactivation was apparently due to the exposure of MS2 to free chlorine before the addition of ammonia. The average 99% CT value of MS2 when exposed to free chlorine was 1.3 and 1.1 at 5 and 15 degrees C, respectively. The average 99% CT values of MS2 briefly exposed to the combined action of free chlorine followed by the addition of ammonia to form monochloramine in situ were 19.3 and 1.5 at 5 and 15 degrees C, respectively. No 99% CT values were calculated for the inactivation of MS2 with preformed monochloramine because less than 1 log (90%) of inactivation occurred during a 4-h contact time. Inactivation of MS2 by monochloramine was more rapid at 15 than at 5 degrees C and when the chlorine to nitrogen weight ratio was 5:1 compared with 3:1. Monochloramine was a more efficient inactivating agent for the coliforms Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae than it was for the MS2 coliphage.", "label": 0}

Visible light\u2013responsive photocatalysts were recently discovered, offering greater opportunity to use photocatalysts as disinfectants in our living environment. The development of antibacterial photocatalysts, however, has mainly focused on titanium oxide (TiO2)\u2013related materials with antibacterial properties not comparable with conventional chemical disinfectants. This study demonstrated that a core-shell structured In2O3@CaIn2O4 substrate has superior visible light\u2013induced bactericidal properties, as compared with several commercially available and laboratory-prepared visible light\u2013responsive photocatalysts. The high performance is enhanced by more easily photoexcited electron transfer between the interfaces of In2O3 and CaIn2O4 to minimize the electron-hole recombination during photocatalysis. Additionally, when compared with TiO2-based photocatalysts, In2O3@CaIn2O4 treatments did not induce significant cell death and tissue damage, implying a superior biocompatibility. These findings suggest that In2O3@CaIn2O4 may have potential application in the development of a safer and highly bactericidal photocatalyst. From the Clinical Editor A photocatalytic susbstrate is described that functions in visible light, possesses bactericidal properties and better biocompatibility than the standard TiO2 based methods.", "label": 0}

To understand cross-contamination risk during washing, we tested a collection of Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC), including O157:H7 and other non-O157 strains, for certain traits during washing of fresh-cut lettuce, i.e., sensitivity to sublethal chlorine levels and ability to cross-contaminate (detach from and attach to) lettuce in the presence of sublethal chlorine levels. Nonpathogenic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) and Pediococcus pentosaceus lactic acid bacterial species (LAB) were included as potential washing process validation surrogates. As measured by extension of the lag phase of growth in media containing 0.15 ppm of chlorine, chlorine sensitivity varied among the STECs. Cross-contamination was assessed by evaluating transfer of bacteria from inoculated to uninoculated leaves during washing. Without chlorine, similar transfer to wash water and uninoculated leaves was shown. In 1 ppm of chlorine, cross-contamination was not detected with most strains, except for the substantial transfer by a STEC O111 strain and EcN in some replicates. Strain O111 and EcN showed less inactivation in 0.25 ppm of chlorine water compared with O157 (P < 0.05). LAB showed similar transfer and similar chlorine inactivation to O157. Considering together the sublethal chlorine sensitivity and detachment/attachment traits, neither EcN nor LAB displayed optimal characteristics as washing process surrogates for the STEC strains, although further evaluation is needed. This work demonstrated a range of behaviors of STEC strains during lettuce washing and may be helpful in hazard characterization, identifying factors to consider for evaluating washing process efficacy, and identifying phenotypic traits to select surrogates to validate washing processes.", "label": 1}
{"id": "6555", "title": "Hand hygiene: simple and complex", "abstract": "Summary This review gives an overview of hand hygiene in healthcare and in the community, including some aspects which have attracted little attention, such as hand drying and cultural issues determining hand hygiene behaviour. Hand hygiene is the most effective measure for interrupting the transmission of microorganisms which cause infection both in the community and in the healthcare setting. Using hand hygiene as a sole measure to reduce infection is unlikely to be successful when other factors in infection control, such as environmental hygiene, crowding, staffing levels and education are inadequate. Hand hygiene must be part of an integrated approach to infection control. Compliance with hand hygiene recommendations is poor worldwide. While the techniques involved in hand hygiene are simple, the complex interdependence of factors which determine hand hygiene behaviour makes the study of hand hygiene complex. It is now recognised that improving compliance with hand hygiene recommendations depends on altering human behaviour. Input from behavioural and social sciences is essential when designing studies to investigate compliance. Interventions to increase compliance with hand hygiene practices must be appropriate for different cultural and social needs. New strategies to promote hand hygiene worldwide include the formation of public\u2013private partnerships.", "label": 0}

DESIGN: This was a prospective, randomized trial of a convenience sample of patients. This study was approved by the institutional review board and Food and Drug Administration as a physician-sponsored trial (FDA investigational new drug no. 68762). SETTING: The study was conducted in a large urban, academic emergency department. PATIENTS: Patients aged 18 to 100 with simple, uncomplicated lacerations requiring repair that were less than 8 hours old were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive either NS or CD wound irrigation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographics, infection, and cosmesis were analyzed and assessed. Cosmetic outcome was assessed at 3 to 4 months using a visual analog scale (VAS), wound evaluation score (WES), patient VAS (VASPt), and digital imaging VAS by 2 plastic surgeons (VASPlast). MAIN RESULTS: One hundred ninety-three patients were enrolled. Data analysis was available for 175 cases (86 NS and 89 CD). Wound infection follow-up was obtained in 74.9% of the patients. The 3- to 4-month cosmesis follow-up was 37.7% for VAS/WES, 40.0% for VASPt, and 37.7% for VASPlast. There were no significant differences in demographics, key wound characteristics, infection, adverse reactions, and cosmesis.

{"id": "201", "title": "Enterobius vermicularis as a Novel Surrogate for the Presence of Helminth Ova in Tertiary Wastewater Treatment Plants", "abstract": "Significant effort has gone into assessing the fate and removal of viruses, bacteria, and protozoan parasites during wastewater treatment to provide data addressing potential health risks associated with reuse options. Comparatively less is known about the fate of parasitic worm species ova in these complex systems. It is largely assumed that these helminths settle, are removed with the sludge, and consequently represent a relatively low risk for wastewater reuse applications. However, helminths are a highly diverse group of organisms that display a wide range of physical properties that complicate the application of a single treatment for helminth reduction during wastewater treatment. Moreover, their diverse biological and physical properties make some ova highly resistant to both disinfection (i.e., with chlorine or UV treatment) and physical removal (settling) through the wastewater treatment train, indicating that there may be reason to broaden the scope of our investigations into whether parasitic worm eggs can be identified in treated wastewater. The ubiquitous human parasitic nematode Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) produces small, buoyant ova. Utilizing a novel diagnostic quantitative PCR (qPCR), this study monitored E. vermicularis presence at two full-scale wastewater treatment plants over the course of 8 months and demonstrated incomplete physical removal of E. vermicularis ova through tertiary treatment, with removal efficiencies approximating only 0.5 and 1.6 log10 at the two wastewater treatment plants based on qPCR. These findings demonstrate the need for more-diverse surrogates of helminthic ova to fully assess treatment performance with respect to reclaimed wastewaters.IMPORTANCE Helminths, despite being a diverse and environmentally resistant class of pathogens, are often underestimated and ignored when treatment performance at modern wastewater treatment plants is considered. A one-size-fits-all surrogate for removal of helminth ova may be inappropriate to adequately assess risk and ensure public safety when treated and partially treated wastewaters are encountered. This study argues for the use of human pinworm as a conservative indicator of the presence of helminth ova due to its small size, buoyancy, prevalence in humans, and environmental resistance.", "label": 0}

Thus, a new bi-functional compound, 4, 4 -Dimethyl hydantoin-undecanoic acid (DMH-UA), was synthesized by treating the potassium salt of dimethyl hydantoin (DMH) with 11-bromoundecanoic acid (BUA). Upon chlorination treatment with diluted bleach, DMH-UA was transformed into 3-chloro-4, 4-dimethyl hydantoin- undecanoic acid (Cl-DMH-UA). Alternatively, DMH-UA could be coated onto the surface of CaCO(3) to obtain the corresponding calcium salt, 4, 4-dimethyl hydantoin-undecanoic acid-calcium carbonate (DMH-UA-CaCO(3)). In the presence of diluted chlorine bleach, the coated DMH-UA on the surface of CaCO(3) was transformed into Cl-DMH-UA, leading to the formation of Cl-DMH-UA-CaCO(3). The reactions were characterized with FT-IR, NMR, UV, DSC and SEM analyses. Both Cl-DMH-UA and Cl-DMH-UA-CaCO(3) were used as antimicrobial additives for cellulose acetate (CA). The antimicrobial efficacy of the resulting samples was evaluated against both Escherichia coli (Gram-negative bacteria) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacteria). It was found that with the same additive content, CA samples with Cl-DMH-UA-CaCO(3) and Cl-DMH-UA had very similar antimicrobial and biofilm-controlling activity, but the former released less active chlorine into the surrounding environment than the latter.", "label": 0}

In this report, an improved method is described for isolation of Salmonella from alfalfa seed lots, which had been implicated in these outbreaks. From each seed lot, eight samples each containing 25 g of seed were tested for the presence of Salmonella by the US FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) procedure and by a modified method applying two successive pre-enrichment steps. Depending on the seed lot, one to-four out of eight samples tested positive for Salmonella by the standard procedure and two to seven out of eight samples tested positive by the modified method. Thus, the use of two consecutive pre-enrichment steps led to a higher detection rate than a single pre-enrichment step. This result indirectly suggested that Salmonella cells on contaminated seeds might be injured and failed to fully resuscitate in pre-enrichment broth containing seed components during the first 24 h of incubation. Responses of heat-injured Salmonella cells grown in buffered peptone water (BPW) and in three alfalfa seed homogenates were investigated. For preparation of seed homogenates, 25 g of seeds were homogenized in 200 ml of BPW using a laboratory Stomacher and subsequently held at 37degreesC for 24 h prior to centrifugation and filtration. While untreated cells grew at about the same rate in BPW and in seed homogenates, heat-injured cells (52degreesC, 10 min) required approximately 0.5 to 4.0 h longer to resuscitate in seed homogenates than in BPW This result suggests that the alfalfa seed components or fermented metabolites from native bacteria hinder the repair and growth of heat-injured cells. This study also shows that an additional pre-enrichment step increases the frequency of isolation of Salmonella from naturally contaminated seeds, possibly by alleviating the toxic effect of seed homogenates on: repair or growth of injured cells.

Chemotherapy is often followed by secondary effects with cellular toxicity negatively affecting the results. The discovery and development of new safe and efficient antitumor agents is necessary. Derivatives of 2-amino thiophene have been a topic of constant investigation due to their versatile synthetic applicability and broad spectrum of biological applications; among which are antifungal and antiproliferative activity shown in prior studies of our group. In the current study, compounds 6CN09, 6CN10, 6CN12, 6CN14, 7CN09 and 7CN11 were analyzed as to antiproliferative effect in human cells of cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa), human pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PANC-1) and mice fibroblasts (3T3), which were exposed to the compounds in concentrations of 5, 10, 25 and 50 ?M during 24 and 48 h. They were submitted to MTT assay. In order to elucidate the action mechanism of antitumor thiophene derivatives flow cytometry was performed to evaluate cell death and cell cycle analysis. The results showed that thiophene derivatives demonstrated great antiproliferative potential in the HeLa and PANC-1 cell lines when compared with the control, and the percentage of cell proliferation inhibition approximated or was higher than the standard drug used; doxorubicin (Dox). In highlight were the derivatives 6CN14 and 7CN09 that showed greater efficiency in the antiproliferative evaluation. Further, all compounds had a protective effect on the non-tumor 3T3 cell line. The flow cytometry analysis showed few cells in apoptosis in both the HeLa and PANC-1 lines, although the compounds interfered with the progression of the cell cycle, and avoided cell growth and multiplication in the HeLa tumor line.

Reaction-diffusion theory was adapted to investigate the potential for transport limitation of the overall rate of biofilm disinfection and the rate of antimicrobial penetration into the biofilm. Disinfection efficacy was investigated with simulations that assumed catalytic reaction of the antimicrobial agent with live and dead cells in a uniformly thick slab with simultaneous transformation of live to dead cells by an independent rate process (disinfection). The intrinsic rate of disinfection was assumed to follow first-order dependence on antimicrobial concentration. Zero- and first-order reaction kinetics of antimicrobial agent with biomass were analyzed. Microbial growth and external mass transfer resistance were neglected. Results show that antimicrobial efficacy, defined as the ratio of the observed rate of biofilm disinfection to the rate that would prevail in the absence of mass transport limitation, decreases sharply as the Thiele modulus exceeds one, The reduction in efficacy worsens when the antimicrobial dose is more concentrated or longer. A second case examined the penetration of an antimicrobial agent into a biofilm with which it reacts stoichiometrically, as would be expected with an oxidizing biocide such as chlorine or ozone. The antimicrobial agent eventually penetrates the biofilm by depleting the reactive biomass constituent, but the time scale for penetration can exceed the time scale for transient diffusion in the absence of reaction by orders of magnitude. These results provide a theoretical basis for explaining experimentally observed resistance of biofilms to chemical disinfectants.", "label": 1}

Three doses of the extract (equivalent to 22, 11, and 3.7 l water) were also tested in the bone marrow micronucleus test using BDF1 mice. At the highest dose, a significant increase of the micronucleus frequency was observed. The time required to be on the effect, however, varied with the source of the water. Our results indicate that the drinking tap waters from the three cities were genotoxic clearly in the bacterial test and also in the in vivo assay with mice. As we found no genotoxicity of the source water as seen in a previous study, it is likely that the chlorination process leads to the genotoxicity of the tap water.", "label": 0}

Treated and source water samples from two sites were analyzed: a river under the influence of an azo dye-processing plant discharge and a reservoir not directly impacted with industrial discharges, but contaminated with untreated domestic sewage. Organic extraction was performed in columns packed with XAD4 resin, that adsorbs a broad class of mutagenic compounds like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), arylamines, nitrocompounds, quinolines, antraquinones, etc., including the halogenated disinfection by-products; and with blue rayon that selectively adsorbs polycyclic planar structures. The organic extracts were tested for mutagenicity with the Salmonella assay using TA98 and TA100 strains and the potencies were compared. A protocol for cleaning the blue rayon fibers was developed and the efficiency of the reused fibers was analyzed with spiked samples. For the river water samples under the influence of the azo-type dye-processing plant, the mutagenicity was much higher for both blue rayon and XAD4 extracts when compared to the water from the reservoir not directly impacted with industrial discharges. For the drinking water samples, although both sites showed mutagenic responses with XAD4, only samples from the site under the influence of the industrial discharge showed mutagenic activity with the blue rayon extraction, suggesting the presence of polycyclic compounds in those samples. As expected, negative results were found with the blue rayon extracts of the drinking water collected from the reservoir not contaminated with industrial discharges. In this case, it appears that using the blue rayon to extract drinking water samples and comparing the results with the XAD resin extracts we were able to distinguish the mutagenicity caused by industrial contaminants from the halogenated disinfection by-products generated during water treatment.", "label": 0}

The inoculated fruits were treated with NEW at 10, 30, and 60 mg liter(-1) active chlorine, with copper oxychloride fungicide, and with sterile distilled water (control) for 3, 5, and 10 min. In the experiment with F. oxysporum, 50 to 80% of the control fruits and 50 to 60% of the fruits treated with the fungicide exhibited symptoms of rot at the inoculated sites. The lowest incidence recorded was 30% for fruits treated with NEW at 60 mg liter(-1) active chlorine with an immersion time of 5 min. In the experiment with G. geotrichum, incidence of rot on control fruits was 70 to 90%, and for treatment with fungicide rot incidence was 50 to 90%. NEW at 60 mg liter(-1) active chlorine significantly reduced incidence of symptomatic fruit: only 30% of the inoculated fruits washed for 5 min had damage from rot. In the experiment with Alternaria sp., 60 to 90% of the fruits in the control group and 60 to 70% of the fruits in the fungicide group were symptomatic. The lowest incidence was recorded for the treatment in which the fruits were submerged in NEW with 60 mg liter(-1) active chlorine for 3 min. In this group, 40 to 50% of the fruits exhibited symptoms of rot. These results were obtained 8 days after inoculation. NEW, with 60 mg liter(-1) active chlorine, significantly reduced incidence of rot symptoms on fruits inoculated with one of the experimental fungi relative to the control (P <= 0.05).

They can act as Trojan Horses for some amoeba-resistant bacteria (ARB). Helicobacter pylori is a pathogenic bacteria, suggested to be transmitted through water, which could belong to the ARB group. In this work, a co-culture assay of H. pylori and Acanthamoeba castellanii, one of the most common FLA, was carried out to identify the presence and survival of viable and potentially infective forms of the bacteria internalized by the amoeba. Molecular techniques including FISH, DVC-FISH, qPCR and PMA-qPCR were used to detect the presence of internalized and viable H. pylori. After 24\u00a0h in co-culture and disinfection treatment to kill extra-amoebic bacteria, viable H. pylori cells were observed inside A. castellanii. When PMA-qPCR was applied to the co-culture samples, only DNA from internalized H. pylori cells was detected, whereas qPCR amplified total DNA from the sample. By the combined DVC-FISH method, the viability of H. pylori cells in A. castellanii was observed. Both specific techniques provided evidence, for the first time, that the pathogen is able to survive chlorination treatment in occurrence with A. castellanii and could be very useful methods for performing further studies in environmental samples.", "label": 1}

Plant-assocd. bacteria, esp. those that are metal tolerant, may enhance the total amt. of metal accumulated by the plant, but this process is still unclear. In this study, we investigated metal enhancement vs. exclusion by plants, and the phytoprotective role plant-assocd. bacteria might provide to plants exposed to heavy metal. We isolated cadmium-tolerant bacteria from the roots of the aquatic plant Lemna minor grown in heavy metal-polluted waters, and tested these isolates for tolerance to cadmium. The efficiency of plants to accumulate heavy metal from their surrounding environment was then tested by comparing L. minor plants grown with added metal tolerant bacteria to plants grown axenically to det., whether bacteria assocd. with these plants increase metal accumulation in the plant. Unexpectedly, cadmium tolerance was not seen in all bacterial isolates that had been exposed to cadmium. Axenic plants accumulated slightly more cadmium than plants inoculated with bacterial isolates. Certain isolates promoted root growth, but overall, addn. of bacterial strains did not enhance plant cadmium uptake, and in some cases, inhibited cadmium accumulation by plants. This suggests that bacteria serve a phytoprotective role in their relationship with Lemna minor, preventing toxic cadmium from entering plants. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

As a waterborne pathogen, it has been found to be resistant to chlorine disinfection and survive in drinking water systems, leading to potential outbreaks of waterborne disease. In this work, the effect of different concentrations of free chlorine was studied (0.2, 0.7, and 1.2 mg l(-1)), the cultivability of cells assessed by standard culture techniques (buffered charcoal yeast extract agar plates) and viability using the SYTO 9/propidium iodide fluorochrome uptake assay (LIVE/DEAD BacLight). Results demonstrate that L. pneumophila loses cultivability after exposure for 30 min to 0.7 mg l(-1) of free chlorine and in 10 min when the concentration is increased to 1.2 mg l(-1). However, the viability of the cells was only slightly affected even after 30 min exposure to the highest concentration of chlorine; good correlation was obtained between the rapid SYTO 9/propidium iodide fluorochrome uptake assay and a longer cocultivation with Acanthamoeba polyphaga assay, confirming that these cells could still recover their cultivability.

In this work, a silicone-based hydrogel was produced and loaded with different ophthalmic drugs: levofloxacin, chlorhexidine, diclofenac and timolol. The drug release profiles, along with several material properties, were evaluated before and after sterilization by three different methods steam heat, ?-irradiation and ozone gas. Independently of the sterilization method used, the results of the swelling and mechanical properties tests strongly indicate the occurrence of specific drug-polymer interactions promoted by the sterilization. In general, these interactions led to a decrease on the amount of drug released. It is shown that ?-irradiation and ozone led to significant degradation of all of the drugs used in this study. Thus, it was concluded that steam heat is the sterilization method with less impact on the devices. More importantly, the present work shows that the development of efficient and functional drug delivery devices for ophthalmic purposes cannot be done independently of a careful analysis of the influence of the sterilization procedures and methods on the degradation of these polymeric systems as a whole.", "label": 0}

Twenty-three of the 26 patients (88%) died. Methods: To determine risk factors for and modes of transmission of gram-negative bacteremia in the NICU, we conducted a cohort study of NICU patients who had at least one blood culture drawn at least 24 hours after admission to the NICU and performed a microbiologic investigation in the NICU. Results: The rate of gram-negative bacteremia was significantly higher among patients born at Hospital General, delivered by cesarian section, and exposed to selected intravenous medications and invasive procedures in the NICU during the 3 days before the referent blood culture was obtained. During the epidemic period, the hospital's chlorinated well-water system malfunctioned; chlorine levels were undetectable and tap water samples contained elevated microbial levels, including total and fecal coliform bacteria. Serratia marcescens was identified in 81% of case-patient blood cultures (13/16) available for testing and from 57% of NICU personnel handwashing (4/7). Most S. marcescens blood isolates were serotype O3:H12 (46%) or O14:H12 (31%) and were resistant to ampicillin (100%) and gentamicin (77%), the antimicrobials used routinely in the NICU.

The development of the potentially active microbiota and the associated volatilome were followed over 15 days of storage under refrigerated conditions (4 \u00b0C), in order to define the potential long-term effects of the treatments and storage condition on microbiota. The targeted RNA-based amplicon sequencing identified Pseudomonas fragi as the most frequent species before and after the treatments with AO and EW, as well as in the untreated control. The tested treatments did not reduce the overall presence of this species, but they affected the intra-species distribution of its oligotypes, albeit slightly. With the progression of the refrigerated storage and the reduction of the oxygen availability, Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc gasicomitatum and Lactococcus piscium became the dominant, potentially active, beef microbiota, as confirmed by microbiological data.

As these agents are difficult to maintain at a therapeutic concentration in the oral cavity and can be rendered ineffective by resistance development in the target organisms, there is a need to develop alternative antimicrobial approaches. Bacteria and other microbes can be sensitised to light through prior treatment with a chemical photosensitising agent. Lethal photosensitisation of a wide range of bacteria responsible for caries, periodontal diseases and root canal infections has been demonstrated using red light in conjunction with a number of photosensitisers, including Toluidine Blue, phthalocyanines and chlorins. The advantages of this approach are that bacteria can be eradicated in very short periods of time (seconds or minutes), resistance development in the target bacteria is unlikely and damage to adjacent host tissues and disruption of the normal microflora can be avoided. This approach may be a useful alternative to antibiotics and antiseptics in eliminating cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria from disease lesions and for the disinfection of root canals. Not only would this be of benefit for the treatment of these diseases but, by replacing the antimicrobial agents that are currently used for such purposes, it would help to conserve our dwindling supply of antimicrobial agents that are effective in the treatment of serious systemic infections. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies 2004.", "label": 0}

Extracts as Antimicrobial Agent Against Common Spoilage Microorganisms of Fresh-Cut Vegetables", "abstract": "Tamarind (Tamarindus indica L.), a versatile underutilized fruit tree with reported antimicrobial activity, shows potential as a natural sanitizer for whole and fresh-cut commodities to avoid the possible formation of harmful by-products from chlorine/chlorine-based sanitizers. Tamarind bark, fruit and leaf extracts were tested for their antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Aspergillus niger, Colletotrichum sp., Candida tropicalis and Debaryomyces hansenii using the disc diffusion and dilution method. Extracts were prepared using water, 85% ethanol and 70% acetone. Fruit-acetone extract (FAE) demonstrated notable effect against the test microorganisms. FAE has low pH, high titratable acidity, high total soluble solids content and probably contains natural substances with antimicrobial activity. Use of 0.5% FAE as washing agent for non-inoculated fresh-cut vegetables (carrots, cucumber and lettuce) effectively reduced the bacterial count compared with samples washed in water alone. However, the fresh-cut vegetables washed with FAE exhibited discoloration and were less acceptable. Despite the poor visual quality response of fresh-cut vegetables, particularly fresh-cut cucumber, even at low concentration, FAE still showed antibacterial effect and showed potential use on more colored fresh cuts or other food systems as anti-bacterial washing agent.", "label": 0}

In this study, whether PL-surfactant combination would provide similar inactivation efficacy of Salmonella on green onions was tested. Different surfactants (SDS and Tween 80) as well as different concentrations (10, 100 and 1000\u00a0ppm) of each surfactant combined with PL were tested. Survival populations of Salmonella and quality of green onions (color and texture) were evaluated after treatments as well as during storage (15 days) at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The results showed that PL-SDS and PL-Tween 80 combinations at various surfactant concentrations provided synergistic inactivation efficacy on green onion leaves (2.6\u20132.9\u00a0log10\u00a0CFU/g and 2.4\u20132.7\u00a0log10\u00a0CFU/g, respectively), but not on their stems (0.4\u20131.0\u00a0log10\u00a0CFU/g and 0.3\u20130.6\u00a0log10\u00a0CFU/g, respectively). PL-1000\u00a0ppm SDS combination negatively impacted color and texture of green onions during 15 day storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. To consider both safety and quality of green onions, PL-10\u00a0ppm SDS was selected since it showed similar Salmonella inactivation on green onions as PL-1000\u00a0ppm SDS but did not affect quality of green onions during shelf-life.", "label": 0}

Unlike (facultative) anaerobes, P. putida resorts to NADH oxidation via an oxic respiratory chain and completely lacks a true fermentation metabolism. Therefore, it cannot achieve the correct balances of energy and redox couples (i.e., ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD+) that are required to sustain an O2-free lifestyle. To overcome this state of affairs, the acetate kinase (ackA) gene of the facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli and the pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB) genes of the aerotolerant Zymomonas mobilis were knocked-in to a wild-type P. putida strain. Biochemical and genetic assays showed that conditional expression of the entire enzyme set allowed the engineered bacteria to adopt an anoxic regime that maintained considerable metabolic activity. The resulting strain was exploited as a host for the heterologous expression of a 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene degradation pathway recruited from Pseudomonas pavonaceae 170, enabling the recombinants to degrade this recalcitrant chlorinated compound anoxically. These results underscore the value of P. putida as a versatile agent for biotransformations able to function at progressively lower redox statuses.", "label": 0}

Bunches of cilantro (10 g) were inoculated with a rifampicin-resistant S. enterica strain (ca. 106 cfu/mL) and held at 22C/60 min. Inoculated cilantro (ca. 5.8 log cfu/g) was then stored at: (1) 22C for 2 days under 100 or 30% RH; (2) 5C for up to 8 days under 100 or 60% RH. Periodically, inoculated cilantro was treated with water, chlorine (200 mg/L), peracetic acid (80 mg/L) or gamma rays (0.5, 1 and 2 kGy). At time 0, reductions of Salmonella with chlorine, peracetic acid or water were 2.6, 2.1 and 1.0 log cfu/g, respectively. At 22C, the effectiveness of disinfection treatments to remove or kill Salmonella cells from cilantro significantly decreased as the storage time elapsed (P < 0.05). A similar trend was observed at 5C. On day 0, irradiation of cilantro at a dose of 0.5, 1 or 2 kGy reduced the pathogen by 3.5, 4.5 and 6 log cfu/g, respectively. At 22C, the efficacy of irradiation decreased (P < 0.05), while at 5C, it remained constant regardless of RH. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS This study demonstrates how the efficacy of decontamination treatments is modified during the storage of cilantro under constant temperature and relative humidity. The decrease in treatment efficacy suggests that microorganisms colonizing the cilantro surface may produce biofilms that provide protection; the level of naturally occurring microflora may also have an influence on its effectiveness. The results reinforce the concept that once cilantro is contaminated with Salmonella, the pathogen can survive chemical disinfection or irradiation, and eventually multiply on cilantro throughout its shelf life.", "label": 1}

We investigated the effectiveness of trisodium phosphate (TSP) and sodium hypochlorite (SH) as antimicrobial treatments against Campylobacter and Salmonella on duck meat under simulated commercial water chilling conditions. The results were compared to the same treatments on well-studied chicken meat. A six strain Campylobacter or Salmonella cocktail was inoculated (5 ml) at two dilution levels (104 and 108 cfu/ml) onto 25 g duck or chicken meat with skin and allowed to attach for 10 min. The meat was exposed to three concentrations of pH adjusted TSP (8, 10 and 12% (w/v), pH 11.5) or SH (40, 50 and 60 ppm, pH 5.5) in 30 ml water under simulated spin chiller conditions (4 \u00b0C, agitation) for 10 min. In a parallel experiment the meat was placed in the antimicrobial treatments before inoculation and bacterial cocktails were added to the meat after the antimicrobial solution was removed while all other parameters were maintained. Untreated controls and controls using water were included in all experiments. Bacterial numbers were determined on Campylobacter blood-free selective agar and Mueller Hinton agar or xylose deoxycholate agar and tryptone soya agar using the thin agar layer method for Campylobacter and Salmonella, respectively. All TSP concentrations significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced numbers of Campylobacter (~ 1.2\u20136.4 log cfu/cm2) and Salmonella (~ 0.4\u20136.6 log cfu/cm2) on both duck and chicken meat. On duck meat, numbers of Campylobacter were less than the limit of detection at higher concentrations of TSP and numbers of Salmonella were less than the limit of detection at all concentrations of TSP except one. On chicken meat, numbers of Campylobacter and Salmonella were less than the limit of detection only at the lower inoculum level and higher TSP concentrations. By contrast only some of the concentrations of SH significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced numbers of Campylobacter and Salmonella (~ 0.2\u20131.5 log cfu/cm2) on both duck and chicken meats. None of the SH treatments resulted in numbers of either pathogen being less than limit of detection. Results indicate that chicken meat has the ability to effectively protect Campylobacter and Salmonella against the impact of trisodium phosphate and sodium hypochlorite while duck meat does not. This study suggests that trisodium phosphate has a strong potential for application in a commercial poultry processing to reduce Campylobacter and Salmonella specifically on duck meat.", "label": 1}

After a wash-out period of 2 weeks and another 2 week run-in period with placebo, all the patients were assigned to a treatment with manidipine 10 mg/ day. After 2 weeks of treatment, the non-normalized (diastolic BP > 90 mmHg) and the non-responders (BP fall < 10 mmHg) received an increase in dosage to 20 mg/day. The drug effects were assessed by casual blood pressure (BP) measurement at baseline and after 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks. At baseline and after 1 year of treatment a 24-h BP monitoring and a Doppler echocardiogram were performed. Routine laboratory tests were performed at baseline, after 6 months and after 1 year of treatment. At the end of the observation period, both casual systolic (p < 0.01) and diastolic (p < 0.001) BP were significantly reduced; 24-h BP monitoring showed a significant decrease in systolic (p < 0.05) and diastolic (p < 0.01) pressure, systolic and diastolic (p < 0.001) daytime and night-time measurements. The peak to through ratio was 67%. No difference was found in heart rate. Reduced interventricular septum thickness (p < 0.05), increased fractional shortening (p < 0.02), reduced end-systolic stress (p < 0.005) and systemic vascular resistances (p < 0.001), and lower values of atrial filling fraction (AFF) (p < 0.001) after 1 year of treatment have been shown at the Doppler-Echo evaluation. A multilinear regression analysis showed a relation between delta %AFF and delta %24-h systolic BP (R = 0.74; F = 7.5: p < 0.05) and with delta % daytime systolic BP (R = 0.77; F = 9.2; p < 0.02). No abnormal changes were observed in laboratory tests. Three non-responder patients and three patients with adverse effects (1 flushing and 2 ankle oedema) dropped out and were excluded from the final analysis. In conclusion, manidipine at an individualized dose of 10 or 20 mg. was effective and safe in the management of arterial hypertension.

The rate of the destruction of the bacteria was lower in the tray test, and the bacteria seemed to be more resistant to the germicides on a steel surface than in vitro. The sanitizer products proved to be more effective than the detergent-sanitizer products. Quaternary ammonium products and an acid sanitizer with hydrogen peroxide were more effective than products containing chlorine compounds and polyhexamethylene biguanide chloride. The effectiveness of hypochlorite products appeared to be dependent on the concentration of available chlorine.

The effects of these modified atmospheres on the fate of both aerobic bacteria and three strains of Listeria monocytogenes, was investigated. Increases in CO2 concentrations significantly reduced the growth of the aerobic microflora. The best preservation of the visual quality occurred on endive leaves stored in 10% CO210% O2, whereas leaves stored in 30% CO210% O2 and 50% CO210% O2, and to a lesser extent in air, showed extensive spoilage after storage. Listeria monocytogenes was slightly affected at 3 \u00b0C by the modified atmospheres, as compared to air. At 10 \u00b0C, results varied between replicate experiments, but L. monocytogenes generally grew better as the CO2 concentration was increased. The three test strains behaved in a similar way.

In the group with IDC, magnesium sulphate was given as slow infusions (50 mg/min over 60 min) twice a day for 7 d. This was antiarrhythmic in all of the patients: ventricular premature contractions and couplets decreased from 13,979 +/- 8964 (mean +/- SD) to 382 +/- 265 (P < 0.001), and from 516 +/- 274 to 9 +/- 6 (P < 0.001), respectively; runs of ventricular tachycardia (41.9 +/- 14.2) disappeared by the fifth day of treatment. The efficacy of antiarrhythmic treatment was evaluated by 24 h Holter monitoring obtained in baseline conditions and after 3, 5 and 10 d from beginning of therapy. In patients with TdP, Mg infusions were instituted at a slow rate (50 mg/min) and continued for 2 h after disappearance of Tdp, which occurred within 20 to 30 min from the start of the Mg infusions. These were followed by prophylactic infusions at rate of 30 mg/min for 90 min twice a day over the next 3 to 4 d. No side effects were observed, and heart rate and QTc remained unchanged from baseline values. In conclusion, Mg infusions may be an effective antiarrhythmic treatment for short and medium-term control of severe ventricular arrhythmias associated with IDC, and may prove useful in the acute treatment of TdP, especially in situations where conventional therapy might prove deleterious or difficult.", "label": 0}

Various natural products from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have been shown to safely suppress proinflammatory pathways and control inflammation-associated disease. In vivo and/or in vitro studies have demonstrated that anti-inflammatory effects of TCM occur by inhibition of the expression of master transcription factors (for example, nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B)), pro-inflammatory cytokines (for example, tumor necrosis factor-?

In the first experiment, all the treatments reduced teat total viable count (TVC), but there was no significant difference between the hypochlorite wash and dry wipe, iodine dip and dry and alcohol-medicated wipe or dry wipe alone. In the second experiment, the chlorine wash and dry wipe was significantly more effective in reducing teat TVC than a water wash and dry, chlorine dip and dry or a dry wipe. There was no relationship between cleaning regime and milk TVC, Enterobacteriaceae or Escherichia coli levels. CONCLUSIONS: All of the cleaning techniques studied reduced teat microbial load, however, the chlorine wash and dry was the most effective.

Free chlorine was found to cause a loss of permeability control, as measured by the efflux of potassium from the cells and a dramatic increase in hydrogen ion permeability, and to affect cell respiration in a nonreversible fashion, as measured by oxygen uptake. The two N-halamines were found to have very little effect on permeability to either potassium or hydrogen ions but were both found to dramatically inhibit respiration in a reversible manner.

Escherichia coli O157:H7 inoculated on radicchio leaves was significantly reduced after 15 min cold plasma treatment (-1.35 log MPN/cm(2)). However, a 30 min plasma treatment was necessary to achieve a significant reduction of Listeria monocytogenes counts (-2.2 log CFU/cm(2)). Immediately after cold plasma treatment, no significant effects emerged in terms of antioxidant activity assessed by the ABTS and ORAC assay and external appearance of the radicchio leaves. Significant changes between treated and untreated radicchio leaves are quality defects based on the cold plasma treatment.

Both fasting glucose (5.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.3 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), insulin levels (12.3 +/- 4.7 vs. 4.9 +/- 1.5 muU/mL; P < 0.0001), and HOMA(IR) (2.7 +/- 1.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.3; P < 0.0001) were significantly higher in hypertensive patients than in the normotensive control group. When we subdivided hypertensive patients according to ACE genotype, we observed that fasting insulin and HOMA(IR) were 16.3 +/- 3.3 and 3.6 +/- 0.8 in the DD genotype, 9.4 +/- 3.1 and 2.1 +/- 0.7 in the ID genotype, and 8.3 +/- 2.8 and 1.9 +/- 0.7 muU/mL in the II group (P < 0.0001, by ANOVA). No significant differences were observed in the normotensive control group. In conclusion, we extended previous data regarding the relationship of hypertension and IR by demonstrating a dependence of this relationship upon the ACE gene polymorphism.", "label": 0}
{"id": "973", "title": "The role of detergents in prevention of transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease", "abstract": "To prevent transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, studies have been carried out to investigate products or processes that would be at least as effective and easier to use than the reference products, i. e. sodium hypochlorite with 2 % activated chlorine and sodium hydroxide. This highlights the problem faced by Central Sterilisation Supply Departments (CSSDs) in finding a detergent endowed with effective cleaning properties and, accordingly, with a very low residual protein load. Different methods have been described in the literature for determination of the residual protein level but it is difficult to apply such methods in the CSSD. Conductance of medical device reprocessing at a central location means that there is an interval between the time the surgical instruments are used and the time they are reprocessed, which is conducive to protein fixation and confirms the need for \"without delay\" predisinfection (pre- soak) as practised in French hospitals. The studies published are based on in vitro tests, showing that the products are able to modify prion protein and make it sensitive to the action of proteinase K, as well as on in vivo tests using steel wires that are used to simulate instruments and implanted into an animal model after having been exposed to the detergent. These studies do not permit comparison of their respective findings and they are in some cases contradictory, because they have been conducted under different conditions (strain, animal, dose, observation period, substrate used, etc.). The detergents tested were either products that are known in the laboratory setting, but have not been designed for routine use, proteases or detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), or commercially available detergents. Published studies have attested to the efficacy of the following detergents: HAMO 100\u00ae, SEPTOCLEAN\u00ae, DECONEX 28 ALKAONE\u00ae, PRIONZYME\u00ae. However, as per the current provisions of Circular 138, the CSSD management cannot dispense with the use of sodium hydroxide.", "label": 1}

The observed inactivation data were then fit to a delayed Chick-Watson model. Based on the model parameter estimation, the Ct values (integrated product of disinfectant concentration C and contact time t over defined time intervals) for 99.9% inactivation of the tested fungal strains ranged from 48.99 mg min/L to 194.7 mg min/L for free chlorine and from 90.33 mg min/L to 531.3 mg min/L for monochloramine. Fungal isolates from a drinking water system (Aspergillus versicolor and Penicillium purpurogenum) were more disinfection resistant than Aspergillus fumigatus type and clinical isolates. The required 99.9% inactivation Ct values for the tested fungal strains are higher than E. coli, a commonly monitored indicator bacteria, and within a similar range for bacteria commonly identified within water distribution systems, such as Mycobacterium spp. and Legionella spp.", "label": 1}

Chlorine dioxide is a possible alternative and an automated washer-disinfector fitted with this agent is currently available. This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of chlorine dioxide in endoscopic disinfection after upper gastrointestinal examination. In vitro microbicidal properties of chlorine dioxide solutions were examined at high (600 ppm) and low (30 ppm) concentrations against various microbes including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare and Bacillus subtilis in the presence or absence of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Immediately following endoscopic procedures and after application to the automated reprocessor incorporating chlorine dioxide at 30 ppm for 5 min, endoscopic contamination with infectious agents, blood, H. pylori ureA gene DNA and HCV-RNA was assessed by cultivation, sensitive test tape, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis, respectively. Chlorine dioxide at 30 ppm has equivalent microbicidal activity against most microbes and faster antimicrobial effects on M. avium-intracellulare and B. subtilis compared with 2% glutaraldehyde, but contamination with BSA affected the microbicidal properties of chlorine dioxide. Endoscopic contamination with microbes, blood and bacterial DNA was eliminated after application of the automated reprocessor/chlorine dioxide system. Thus, chlorine dioxide is a potential alternative to glutaraldehyde. The use of automated reprocessors with compatibility to chlorine dioxide, coupled with thorough pre-cleaning, can offer effective, faster and less problematic endoscopic disinfection.", "label": 0}

A 30-min exposure to UV-A light in presence of 10 mM GA had relevant biological effect in the inactivation of E. coli 0157:H7 in suspension in the absence (>5 log(CFU/mL)) and the presence of organic content (>3-log(CFU/mL) in 2000 mg O-2/L COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) organic load), and resulted in similar to 80% decrease in the metabolic activity of E. coli 01.57:H7 biofilm. GA solutions could be recycled through at least 3-cycles of UV-A treatment without a significant loss in antibacterial effect. Catalase reduced the extent of E. coli 0157:H7 inactivation from the UV-A + GA treatment suggesting that generation of hydrogen peroxide was partially responsible for the observed antimicrobial effect. The UV-A + GA treatment was also found to be effective in causing >3 log(CFU/mL) reductions in E. coli 0157:H7 on the surface of spinach leaves. UV-A + GA treatment can serve as an effective intervention in the fresh produce sanitation. Industrial relevance: The results of this study show that a synergistic interaction between gallic acid (GA) and UV-A (365 nm) light is an effective treatment for sanitation of fresh produce and water used to wash fresh produce. It was also found to be effective against the E. coli 0157:H7 biofilm. The attractive attributes of this technology include a relatively low cost; specific, light-triggered activity; non-toxic nature and scalability. Thus, this technology has potential to replace conventional chemical sanitizer-based sanitation approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "label": 0}

Salt rejection decreased by only 12.7% and water flux increased by 2.5L/m2h after the chlorination test. aPES/aTMA significantly modified the three-dimensional polyamide (PA) network structures and contributed to the high performance because of copolymer chain stiffness due to a high degree of cross-linking in the RO membranes. Therefore, aPES and aTMA, which helped improve water permeability, also protected the active layer structure from degradation and enhanced chlorine resistance of the RO membrane. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.", "label": 0}

Traveler's diarrhea is defined as 4 to 5 loose stools per day, which usually lasts 2 to 3 days.11 It is frequently associated with nausea, vomiting, cramps, tenesmus, or bloody mucoid stool. Attacks often occur in the first week of travel.13 Diarrheal attack rates approach 50% over 2 to 3 weeks among visitors to the tropics.8 Ten percent of cases last longer than 1 week; 2% last longer than 1 month; and less than 1% last longer than 3 months. Fifteen per cent of patients experience vomiting, and 2% to 10% develop bloody stools or fever.11 It is rarely life threatening; rather it is more often an inconvenience. Conversely, 20% of patients will be bedridden as a result of their illness.4 Traveler's diarrhea is acquired through the ingestion of fecally contaminated food and water. It is a problem common to developing nations, as standards of sanitation and personal hygiene are frequently lacking. Epidemiologically, destination appears to be the most important risk for developing traveler's diarrhea. Destinations can be divided into high, intermediate, and low risk. High-risk destinations include Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East; intermediate-risk locations include southern Europe and the Caribbean; and low-risk sites include Canada/United States, northern Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.11 There are other well-recognized risk factors for developing traveler's diarrhea. The consumption of certain foods places one at high risk for developing traveler's diarrhea. These include raw vegetables, meats and seafood, ice and tap water, and unpasteurized dairy products.11 Age appears to be a risk factor, with an increased frequency of traveler's diarrhea occurring in young adults presumably because of their more adventurous eating habits.14 Finally, eating locations appear to be important in the risk of developing traveler's diarrhea, with decreased frequency seen in those who eat in private homes and luxury resorts versus restaurants and street vendors.11 Traveler's diarrhea has multiple causes (Table 1). Some of the diarrheas that affect travelers may be noninfectious and self-limited, and are related to eating strange foods, nervous tension, fatigue, altitude, and probably other poorly defined factors.15 Infectious causes include a variety of bacteria, viruses, parasites, and protozoa. Of the infectious causes, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli has been demonstrated in most cases of travelers diarrhea originating in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.14Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter occur less frequently.14 The exact role of viral infections is unclear. Viruses may be found in the stool of up to 36% of patients with travelers diarrhea; however, a comparable number of asymptomatic patients have virus present in their stool.11 Although not typically classified as causes of traveler's diarrhea, it is important to consider other potentially serious infections acquired by travelers who may present with a major complaint of diarrhea; these include malaria, plague, meliodosis, typhus, and arboviral hemorrhagic illnesses.7", "label": 0}

However, exposure to 254-nm-UVC light causes DNA lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) in human cells, and can induce skin cancer after long-term repeated exposures. It has been reported that short wavelength UVC is absorbed by proteins in the membrane and cytosol, and fails to reach the nucleus of human cells. Hence, irradiation with 222-nm UVC might be an optimum combination of effective disinfection and biological safety to human cells. In this study, the biological effectiveness of 222-nm UVC was investigated using a mouse model of a skin wound infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Irradiation with 222-nm UVC significantly reduced bacterial numbers on the skin surface compared with non-irradiated skin. Bacterial counts in wounds evaluated on days 3, 5, 8 and 12 after irradiation demonstrated that the bactericidal effect of 222-nm UVC was equal to or more effective than 254-nm UVC. Histological analysis revealed that migration of keratinocytes which is essential for the wound healing process was impaired in wounds irradiated with 254-nm UVC, but was unaffected in 222-nm UVC irradiated wounds. No CPD-expressing cells were detected in either epidermis or dermis of wounds irradiated with 222-nm UVC, whereas CPD-expressing cells were found in both epidermis and dermis irradiation with 254-nm UVC. These results suggest that 222-nm UVC light may be a safe and effective way to reduce the rate of surgical site and other wound infections.", "label": 0}

Crystal structures of HIV-1 RT complexed with 8-Cl TIBO (R86183, IC50 = 4.6 nM) and 9-Cl TIBO (R82913, IC50 = 33 nM) have been determined at 3.0 A resolution. Mutant HIV-1 RT, containing Cys in place of Tyr at position 181 (Tyrl81Cys), is highly resistant to many NNRTIs and HIV-1 variants containing this mutation have been selected in both cell culture and clinical trials. We also report the crystal structure of Tyrl81Cys HIV-1 RT in complex with 8-Cl TIBO (IC50 = 130 nM) determined at 3.2 A resolution. Averaging of the electron density maps computed for different HIV-1 RT/NNRTI complexes and from diffraction datasets obtained using a synchrotron source from frozen (-165 degrees C) and cooled (-10 degrees C) crystals of the same complex was employed to improve the quality of electron density maps and to reduce model bias. The overall locations and conformations of the bound inhibitors in the complexes containing wild-type HIV-1 RT and the two TIBO inhibitors are very similar, as are the overall shapes and volumes of the non-nucleoside inhibitor-binding pocket (NNIBP). The major differences between the two wild-type HIV-1 RT/TIBO complexes occur in the vicinity of the TIBO chlorine substituents and involve the polypeptide segments around the beta5-beta6 connecting loop (residues 95 to 105) and the beta13-beta14 hairpin (residues 235 and 236). In all known structures of HIV-1 RT/NNRTI complexes, including these two, the position of the beta12-beta13 hairpin or the \"primer grip\" is significantly displaced relative to the position in the structure of HIV-1 RT complexed with a double-stranded DNA and in unliganded HIV-1 RT structures. Since the primer grip helps to position the template-primer, this displacement suggests that binding of NNRTIs would affect the relative positions of the primer terminus and the polymerase active site. This could explain biochemical data showing that NNRTI binding to HIV-1 RT reduces efficiency of the chemical step of DNA polymerization, but does not prevent binding of either dNTPs or DNA. When the structure of the Tyr181Cys mutant HIV-1 RT in complex with 8-Cl TIBO is compared with the corresponding structure containing wild-type HIV-1 RT, the overall conformations of Tyr181Cys and wild-type HIV-1 RT and of the 8-Cl TIBO inhibitors are very similar. Some positional changes in the polypeptide backbone of the beta6-beta10-beta9 sheet containing residue 181 are observed when the Tyr181Cys and wild-type complexes are compared, particularlty near residue Val179 of beta9. In the p51 subunit, the Cys181 side-chain is oriented in a similar direction to the Tyr181 side-chain in the wild-type complex. However, the electron density corresponding to the sulfur of the Cys181 side-chain in the p66 subunit is very weak, indicating that the thiol group is disordered, presumably because there is no significant interaction with either 8-Cl TIBO or nearby amino acid residues. In the mutant complex, there are slight rearrangements of the side-chains of other amino acid residues in the NNIBP and of the flexible dimethylallyl group of 8-Cl TIBO; these conformational changes could potentially compensate for the interactions that were lost when the relatively large tyrosine at position 181 was replaced by a less bulky cysteine residue. In the corresponding wild-type complex, Tyr181 iin the p66 subunit has significant interactions with the bound inhibitor and the position of the Tyr181 side-chain is well defined in both subunits.

This is attributed to the unavailability of proper water treatment, sanitary infrastructure and poor hygiene. As a consequence, countries facing cholera outbreaks rely on interventions such as the use of oral rehydration therapy and antibiotics to save lives. In addition to vaccination, the provision of chlorine tablets and hygiene sensitization drives have been used to prevent new cholera infections. The implementation of these interventions remains a challenge due to constraints associated with the cost, ease of use and technical knowhow. These challenges have been reduced through the use of solar water disinfection (SODIS). The success of SODIS in mitigating the risk associated with the consumption of waterborne pathogens has been associated with solar irradiation. This has prompted a lot of focus on the solar component for enhanced disinfection. However, the role played by the host immune system following the consumption of solar-irradiated water pathogens has not received any significant attention. The mode of inactivation resulting from the exposure of microbiologically contaminated water results in immunologically important microbial states as well as components. In this review, the possible influence that solar water disinfection may have on the immunity against cholera is discussed.", "label": 1}
{"id": "2378", "title": "Characterization and Mechanism for the Protection of Photolytic Decomposition of N-Halamine Siloxane Coatings by Titanium Dioxide", "abstract": "N-Halamine antibacterial materials have superior inactivation activities due to oxidative chlorine species. However, N-Cl bonds and bonds between N-halamine and substrates often decompose rapidly under UV irradiation, leading to unrecoverable loss of antimicrobial activity. In this study, titanium dioxide was covalently bonded onto N-halamine siloxane poly[5,5-dimethyl-3-(3'-triethoxysilylpropyl)hydantoin] (PSPH) via a sol-gel process. Experimental testing of the chlorinated cotton fabrics treated with TiO2/PSPH demonstrated that the residual oxidative chlorine in cotton-TiO2/PSPH-Cl was still effective for inactivating bacteria after 50 washing cycles and under UV light irradiation for 24 h. Quantum mechanical calculations found that TiO2 improves the UV stability of the PSPH-Cl system by increasing the activation barrier of the C-Si scission reaction responsible for the loss of the biocidal hydantoin moiety. SEM, XPS and FTIR spectra were used to characterize the coated cotton samples. Cotton-TiO2/PSPH-Cl samples exhibited good antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) and Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43895). The storage stability and washing stability of treated cotton fabrics were also investigated.", "label": 0}

In this state, cells lose culturability but retain viability and the potential to revert to the metabolically active and infectious state. To examine the effects of chlorination on cells in different physiological states, cells from the logarithmic and stationary phases, or nutrient starved, or grown in natural wastewater, were studied. Isogenic cells with and without plasmids were also examined. Whereas a mixture of free and combined chlorine, as occurs under typical wastewater disinfection, was found to be rapidly lethal to most cells, regardless of their physiological state or plasmid content, c. 10(4) of the original 10(6) cells ml(-1) did survive in the VBNC state.

Internalization processes, photosensitizing efficacy of TPC(m-O-GluOH)3 and TPC(m-O-GluOH)4, in HT29 human adenocarcinoma cells have been compared to those of tetra(meta-hydroxyphenyl) chlorin (m-THPC, Foscan\u00ae). The tetra glucoconjugated chlorin, TPC(m-O-GluOH)4, was found to be poorly internalized and weakly photoactive. In contrast, the asymmetric and more amphiphilic compound TPC(m-O-GluOH)3, exhibited superior phototoxicity compared to m-THPC. Drug concentration, temperature and sodium azide effects indicated that TPC(m-O-GluOH)3 internalization partly proceeds via an active receptor-mediated endocytosis mechanism. Cellular uptake appeared as a saturable process and remained 30% lower than for mTHPC. However, a maximum phototoxicity in HT29 cells (survival fraction of 2\u00b10.6%) were observed for concentration as low as 2 ?M. A 4-fold higher concentration of m-THPC was necessary to observe the same level of photoactivity. This higher phototoxicity has been correlated to a greater mitochondrial affinity.

REPORTING PERIOD: 2009-2010. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: Fifty state and two metropolitan public health agencies voluntarily report cases of cryptosporidiosis through CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. RESULTS: For 2009, 7,656 confirmed and probable cases of cryptosporidiosis (2.5 per 100,000 population) were reported; for 2010, 8,951 confirmed and probable cases (2.9 per 100,000 population) were reported. All jurisdictions reported cryptosporidiosis cases for 2009-2010, and the number of jurisdictions reporting >3.5 cases per 100,000 population was 18 for 2009 and 20 for 2010. Cases were most frequently reported in children aged 1-9 years, followed by adults aged 25-29 years. This is the first reporting period in which more cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported in females than in males. Peak onset of illness occurred during early summer through early fall; the sympton onset of cases in children aged 5-9 years peaked earlier than that of cases reported in adults aged 25-34 years. INTERPRETATION: Transmission of Cryptosporidium occurs throughout the United States. Rate data from reporting jurisdictions should be compared with caution because individual jurisdictions have varying capacities to detect, investigate, and report cases. The symptom onset and age-specific peaks coincide with the summer recreational water season and might reflect increased use of communal swimming venues (e.g., swimming pools and interactive fountains) by young children who then transmit the parasite to other users and their caregivers. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Local, state, and federal public health agencies can use cryptosporidiosis surveillance data to characterize the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in the United States, establish public health priorities (e.g., research) to improve cryptosporidiosis prevention and control, and design and evaluate efforts (e.g., health communication and policy) to prevent and control the transmission of Cryptosporidium.", "label": 1}

A minimum of six replicates were performed per treatment. Paper, cloth, wood, and carpet were inoculated with either fungal spores (Stachybotrys chartarum, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium chrysogenum, or Chaetomium globosum) at 240,000 spores/2.54 cm2 of material or with the mycotoxins roridin A, T-2, and verrucarin A at 10 microg per 2.54 cm2 of material. Treatments were evaluated with an agar plating technique for fungal spores and a yeast toxicity culture assay for mycotoxins. Results showed that gamma irradiation inactivated fungal spores, but the treatment was not successful in inactivating mycotoxins. The washing technique completely inactivated or removed spores on all materials except for C. globosum, which was reduced on all items except paper (p < 0.05). Washing inactivated all mycotoxins on paper and cloth but not on carpet or untreated wood (p < 0.001). The steam cleaning treatment did not completely eliminate any fungal spores; however, it reduced P. chrysogenum numbers on all materials, C. globosum was reduced on wood and carpet, and S. chartarum was reduced on wood (p < 0.05). Steam cleaning was unsuccessful in inactivating any of the tested mycotoxins. These results show that the bleach/detergent washing technique was more effective overall in reducing spore and mycotoxin levels than gamma irradiation or steam cleaning.

The residual chlorine is determined by the color reaction with o-tolidine (3,3'-dimethylbenzidine). The maximum absorbance for Cl(2) is at 437 nm. A linear calibration graph (0-4.0x10(-5) M CN(-)) is obtained under optimal reaction conditions at room temperature and pH 11-12. The stoichiometric mole ratio of chlorine to cyanide is 1:1. The effective molar absorptivity for cyanide is 5.87x10(4) l mol(-1) cm(-1) at pH 1.6. The limit of quantification (LOQ) is 3.6x10(-7) M or 9.4 ppb. Effects of pH, excess reagent, sensitivity, reaction time and tolerance limits of interferent ions are reported. The method was applied to the determination of cyanide in a real sample. The basic interferent usually accompanying CN(-), i.e. thiocyanate, is separated from cyanide by sorption on a melamine-formaldehyde resin at pH 9 while cyanide is not retained. Thiocyanate is eluted with 0.4 M NaOH from the column and determined spectrophotometrically using the acidic FeCl(3) reagent. The initial column effluent containing cyanide was analyzed by both the developed chlorine-o-tolidine method and the conventional barbituric acid-pyridine (Spectroquant 14800) procedure, and the results were statistically compared. The developed method is relatively inexpensive and less laborious than the standard (Spectroquant) procedure, and insensitive to the common interferent, cyanate (CNO(-)).", "label": 0}

The cyanobacterium was exposed to H2O2 in the range of 0-60 mg.L-1 for 3.5 h. Production of OH radical in the solution was estimated by a chemical probe method. More than 99% (2 log) of the M. aeruginosa cells were ruptured or damaged by 3 h for all the treatments. Loss of cell integrity over time revealed two distinct phases. Cells retained their integrity during the initial lag phase and rapidly ruptured following first-order reaction afterward. A linear relationship was found between the duration of the lag phase and the steady-state concentration of OH radical. Release of MCs was closely correlated with the loss of cell integrity. Sequential reaction models were developed to simulate the release and degradation of MCs. These models were able to quantitatively describe the kinetics of all reactions under different H2O2 doses and extended exposure time. In particular, the models successfully predicted the concentration change of MCs using independently measured parameters. These models provide a simple and quantitative means to estimate the interaction of oxidants and cells and the consequent release of metabolites during oxidation treatment of cyanobacterium-laden waters.", "label": 0}

Effective wastewater treatment processes are critical to protect public health during water reuse practices. However, the microbial removal efficiencies in wastewater reclamation plants are not routinely monitored due to the lack of a simple quantification method. This study applied a near real-time flow cytometry (FCM) technique to quantify the removal of total bacteria and viruses at three wastewater reclamation plants in Southern California. The results showed that the activated sludge process removed 1-2 log(10) of bacteria but was not efficient at removing viruses. The membrane bioreactor process was capable of removing both bacteria and viruses with high efficiency. At the plant using chloramines as the main disinfectant, even though culturable total coliform bacteria were effectively reduced to the level meeting the California Title 22 Water Recycling Criteria (7-day median of 2.2 most probable number (MPN)/100 mL, and no more than one sample exceeds 23 MPN/100 mL), the disinfected final effluent still contained greater than 10(6) bacterial and 10(8) viral particles per mL in.

The effects of ClO2 on bacterial cell morphology, outer membrane permeability, cytoplasmic membrane disruption and intracellular enzymatic activity were also studied to elucidate the mechanism of action on the cells. Increasing temperature and disinfectant concentration were proportional to the rate of cell killing, but efficacy was found to be significantly subdued at 0.5\u00a0mg/L and less dependent on the bacterial density. The bactericidal efficiency was higher at alkaline pH of 8 or above as compared to neutral and slightly acidic pH of 7 and 6.5 respectively. The disinfection kinetic curves followed a biphasic pattern of rapid inactivation within the initial 2\u00a0min which were followed by a tailing even in the presence of residual biocide. The curves were adequately described by the Cavg Hom model. Transmission Electron Microscopy images of the bacteria cells exposed to lethal concentrations of ClO2 indicated very little observable morphological damage to the outer membranes of the cells. ClO2 however was found to increase the permeability of the outer and cytoplasmic membranes leading to the leakage of membrane components such as 260\u00a0nm absorbing materials and inhibiting the activity of the intracellular enzyme ?-D-galactosidase. It is suggested that the disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane and subsequent efflux of intracellular components result in the inactivation of the Gram-negative bacteria.", "label": 0}

The chlorine demand and wash water quality parameters including pH, oxidation reduction potential (ORP), ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), COD, turbidity, total protein content, total phenolics content and color difference between deionized water and test samples (Delta E) were measured. The correlations between variables were determined. UV254 had the highest correlation coefficient with chlorine demand of various fresh produce wash waters (R = 0.77). Further analysis of chlorine demand with UV254 relation showed that two clusters exit, one for produce with high phenolics content and one for low phenolics content. The phenolics-to-protein/Delta E ratio (PPC) was created to identify in which cluster each produce wash water should be. Empirical equations for predicting chlorine demand were developed as chlorine demand = 295.23 x UV254 + 6.97, if PPC < 0.6; or chlorine demand = 119.77 x UV254 + 2.41, if PPC >= 0.6. These two prediction equations were further verified using additional produce wash waters not used for model development. The outcomes of this study demonstrated that the prediction equations developed using water quality parameters can be used to estimate the chlorine demand of different produce wash waters.

Thus, humans are surrounded and continually exposed.

The frequency of pulmonary infections is 10/100,000, with the highest rates in persons older than 60 years (100/100,000). In addition to community-acquired infections, hospital-acquired infections are becoming increasingly prevalent, usually associated with surgery or injection. Multiple mycobacterial species or clones are common in pulmonary patients, necessitating isolation of multiple mycobacterial-like colonies from patient samples, as isolates from a single patient may belong to different species with different antibiotic susceptibilities. The reemergence of nontuberculous mycobacterial disease following successful antibiotic therapy is common.", "label": 1}

The effects of regenerant wastewater irrigation and high concentrations of Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, and Cl- on growth and ion uptake of nine species of landscape plants were studied. Significant differences in chloride tolerance were detected among the species. Generally, the species that had greater uptake of chloride grew less than species that took up less amounts of chloride. Lace fern (Athyrium filixfemina Roth.) had the highest tissue chlorine (Cl) concentration and was the most affected. Hydrangea (Hydrangea macrophylla Ser.) also had high tissue Cl concentration, but showed no growth reduction. Its tolerance was attributable to a high tissue calcium (Ca) concentration. The data suggest that in the species tested, higher tissue Ca concentrations were positively correlated with plant tolerance to Cl. Overall, the Cl- concentration in the wastewater seems to be the factor most likely to create problems for the landscape plants. However, severe negative effects will probably", "label": 0}

A stable symmetrical low-flow helium discharge is formed at atmospheric pressure with a minimum field strength at the axis. Thus, a triangle shaped ring plasma is obtained with a channel at the center through which the sample is introduced using a laminar dual-flow injector. The helium plasma operates at a microwave input power of 30-150 W and total gas flow of 200-1500 ml min(-1) and it is self-igniting. The preliminary investigation of the plasma fundamental parameters provides a He excitation temperature up to 4000 K, rotational temperature (OH) up to 3100 K and electron number density up to 7.5 x 10(14) cm(-3). To demonstrate the plasma robustness, both the tolerance for water loading and the excitation and ionisation capability for hydride-forming elements as well as for ionic chlorine are presented. The detection limits for As, Sb and Hg obtained by continuous hydride generation without hydrogen separation were 12, 10 and 9 ng ml(-1), respectively.", "label": 0}

A mixture of the two viruses was prepared in a 10% suspension of feces, and 10 microliters of the mixture was placed on each finger pad. The inoculum was allowed to dry for 20 min, and the contaminated area was exposed to a hand-washing agent for 10 s, rinsed in tap water, and dried with a paper towel. In the whole-hand protocol, the hands were contaminated with 0.5 ml of the virus mixture, exposed for 10 s to a hand-washing agent, washed, and dried as described above. Tryptose phosphate broth was used to elute any virus remaining on the finger pads or hands. One part of the eluate was assayed directly for PV with FRhK-4 cells, while the other part was first treated with a PV-neutralizing serum and then assayed for HAV with the same cell line.

The internalization of the photosensitizer Foslip\u00ae into tongue-squamous epithelium carcinoma cells (CAL-27) was examined in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. For detecting apoptosis, annexin V was covalently coupled to the near-infrared dye DY-734 and the spectroscopic properties and binding affinity to apoptotic CAL-27 cells were elucidated. CAL-27 tumor bearing mice were treated with PDT and injected 2 days and 2 weeks thereafter with DY-734-annexin V. PDT-induced changes in tumor vascularization were detected with the contrast agent IRDye\u00ae 800CW RGD up to 3 weeks after PDT. A perinuclear enrichment of Foslip\u00ae could be seen in\u00a0vitro which was reflected in an accumulation in CAL-27 tumors in\u00a0vivo. The DY-734-annexin V (coupling efficiency 30\u201350%) revealed a high binding affinity to apoptotic compared to non-apoptotic cells (17.2% vs. 1.2%) with a KD-value of 20\u00a0nm. After PDT-treatment, the probe showed a significantly higher (p &lt;0.05) contrast in tumors at 2 days compared to 2 weeks after therapy (2\u20138\u00a0h post injection). A reduction of the vascularization could be detected after PDT especially in the central tumor areas. To detect the therapeutic efficacy of PDT, a multiplexed imaging approach is necessary.

Microsporidia represent a group that contains a number of genera related to the genus Cryptosporidium. They are generally transmitted via direct human to human contact, but can survive in water and food, and recently have been found in surface water used as drinking source water. Their most common host range is in patients with clinical AIDS. Limited work to date suggests the group is susceptible to chlorine achievable CxT (concentration x time) values and is coagulated by filtration. Cyclospora cayetanensis is a species of parasite that has caused outbreaks from contaminated food. Its major risk is from the use of inadequately treated water used for irrigation. Cyclospora can infect normal and immunosuppressed hosts.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Chlorine demand depended on the microbial concentration and was independent on the initial chlorine concentration and temperature. Chlorine decay was modelled by the addition of two first-order decay equations. Inactivation of L. monocytogenes by chlorine depended on the initial microbial concentration, initial chlorine concentration and temperature. A mathematical model based on a biphasic inactivation properly described survival curves of L. monocytogenes and a tertiary model was developed that satisfactorily predicted the inactivation of L. monocytogenes by different concentrations of initial chlorine at different temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: Both available chlorine decay and inactivation of L. monocytogenes by chlorine were biphasic and can be modelled by a two-term exponential model. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The biphasic nature of survival curves of L. monocytogenes did not reflect the effect of a change of available chlorine concentration during the treatment. The microbial inactivation was caused by successive reactions that occur after the consumption of the chlorine by the bacterial cell components.", "label": 1}

Perdue Water Treatment Plant (WTP), a 30 mgd conventional filtration plant located in San Diego County, California. This paper documents the results of SWA's pilot testing of chlorine dioxide (ClO2), dissolved air flotation (DAF), and submerged microfiltration/ultrafiltration (MF/UF) membranes, begun in early 2004, as a reliable and cost-effective treatment strategy for meeting future DBP regulations. The Perdue WTP treats two source waters, local surface water from Sweetwater Reservoir (SWR) (av. total org. carbon (TOC) = 6.5 mg/L, bromide up to 0.5 mg/L) and San Diego County Water Authority (CWA) aqueduct water (av. TOC = 2.5 mg/L, low bromide). SWA currently applies free chlorine and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) to the raw SWR water and uses chloramines in the distribution system. However, excessive trihalomethanes (THMs) formation is a potential concern for compliance with the Stage 2 Disinfection Byproducts (DBP) Rule using the Locational Running Annual Av. (LRAA) method. The current testing program was preceded by pilot testing of intermediate-ozone with enhanced coagulation (30 mg/L ferric chloride) and bench-scale testing of ClO2 and ferric chloride doses up to 80 mg/L, results of which will also be highlighted in this paper. CWA was responsible for the first phase of DAF and MF/UF membrane testing at the Perdue WTP site, using the CWA Aqueduct water as the pilot feedwater. With DAF as pretreatment, both of the submerged membrane systems tested provided reliable water quality at fluxes above 30 U.S. gal per square foot per day (gfd) (51 L per h per square meter), with recoveries around 95%, for at least 30 days before the need for membrane clean-in-place (CIP). For the SWR water testing, the full-scale WTP influent is being treated with ClO2 at doses up to 1.5 mg/L, and chlorite is controlled by applying ferrous chloride (FeCl2) at a 3.3:1 ratio of ferrous ion to chlorite. The first two weeks of the SWR water testing used DAF pretreated water as the feedwater to the membrane pilots while the following six weeks used settled water from the full-scale plant as the membrane feedwater to compare the effects of these two pretreatment options on membrane operation. Membrane fluxes were set initially based on the results from the CWA water testing and optimized to provide a min. 30 day CIP interval. ClO2 was evaluated as the plant primary disinfectant with chloramines downstream of the membranes for distribution system residual. In addn. to monitoring the performance of the DAF and membrane systems, simulated distribution system (SDS) testing was conducted on the membrane filtrate on a weekly basis to est. disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation. The process combination of ClO2, DAF, and submerged membranes represents a promising process combination for agencies seeking to meet the stage 2 DBP Rule with source waters with high bromide and highly reactive TOC.

Groups of 5 male and female 7-week-old gpt delta C57BL/6J transgenic mice were given MX at doses of 0, 10, 30, or 100 ppm in their drinking water for 12 weeks, and then killed to assess in vivo mutagenicity using 6-thioguanine and Spi- selection, and cell proliferative activity using immunohistochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Further groups of 10 male and female gpt delta mice were given 0 or 100 ppm MX for 78 weeks, and a full necropsy with histopathological examination of all organs was conducted to detect neoplastic lesions. The 12-week MX treatment did not result in mutagenicity in the livers or lungs or cell proliferative activity in several organs of the mice, and the 78-week treatment did not cause carcinogenicity. Additional investigations were conducted to evaluate the potential of MX to inhibit gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in rat liver epithelial cells (WB cells) by the scrape loading/dye transfer method. Inhibition of GJIC was detected within 2 hr with a noncytotoxic dose of MX (4 microg/ml), followed by partial restoration after 5 hr. A second phase of inhibition occurred after 10 hr and then the lowered level persisted for the 24 hr-incubation period. Dose-dependent inhibition was evident at both 2 hr and 24 hr, with much stronger effects at the former time. These findings indicate that MX is not mutagenic, mitogenic or carcinogenic in mice, and suggest that the compound exerts epigenetic actions leading to GJIC inhibition.", "label": 0}

Such combinations are commonly based upon a permanent metallic implant (such as stainless steel or titanium) and are then coated with a drug-eluting polymer or ceramic system. Drug elution is also possible from the implant itself by utilising metallic foams, porous architectures and bioresorbable metals. This review will explore the current research into metallic implant drug/device combinations via a critical review of the relevant literature.", "label": 0}

Hence, this study aimed at assessing the physicochemical and microbiological quality of public swimming pools located at different hotels and recreation center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHOD: A cross sectional study was carried out from February to May, 2016. Nine hotels and one recreation center which recognized to have public swimming services were included. A total of 60 swimming pool water samples from 10 swimming pools were collected at deeper, shallow and intake point twice on a weekly basis using a 250 ml sterile bottle containing sodium thiosulphate. PH, residual chlorine and temperature of samples were recorded at the time of collection. Sample containing bottles were transported in ice box to microbiological laboratory and analyzed on the same day. Standard cultural and biochemical methods were used for isolation and characterization of the main microbial groups. Total viable count, total coliform count, fecal coliform count and E. coli were determined. Data was analyzed using SPSS Version 20. RESULTS: Average PH and temperature of swimming pool water samples were 7.1 and 29(o)C respectively. Of all analyzed water samples, 58.4% (n=35/60) of them had PH range of 7.2-7.8, 58.3% (n=35/60) of samples had temperature in the range of 21(o)C-32(o)C and 25% (n=15/60) of water samples had residual chlorine in the range of 2-3mg/l. 73.3% (n=44/60) of the samples had a total viable count below 200 MPN/ml and 70% (n-42/60) of the samples had Total Coliform Count values less than 2 MPN/100 ml. Moreover, 66.7% (n=40/60) of the samples had fecal coliform counts falling below 1 MPN /100 ml. E. coli was absent in 70% (n=42/60) of the samples while it was present in 30% (n=18/60) of the samples. CONCLUSION: PH, residual chlorine and temperature value of majority of the swimming pools' water samples were within the acceptable limit. Regarding microbial quality, most swimming pools' water samples complied to the WHO standard. Swimming pools that did not comply to the standard both in physicochemical levels and microbial quality need improvement due to their significant health implication.", "label": 0}

Polystyrene (PS) surfaces were functionalized by spin coating of sub-monolayer and monolayer films of poly(styrene-b-tert-butyl acrylate) (PS-PtBA) block copolymer from solutions in toluene. PS-PtBA self-assembled to a bilayer structure on PS that contains a surface layer of the PtBA blocks ordering at the air-polymer interface and a bottom layer of the PS blocks entangling with the PS substrate. The thickness of PtBA layer could be linearly controlled by the concentration of the spin coating solution and a 2.5nm saturated monolayer coverage of PtBA was achieved at 0.35% (w/w). Carboxyl groups were generated by exposing the tert-butyl ester groups of PtBA on saturated surface to trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to bond tert-butylamine via amide bonds that were further chlorinated to N-halamine with NaOCl solution. The density of N-halamine on the chlorinated surface was calculated to be 1.05x10(-5) mol/m(2) by iodimetric/thiosulfate titration. Presented data showed the N-halamine surface provided powerful antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Over 50% of the chlorine lost after UVA irradiation could be regained upon rechlorination. This design concept can be virtually applied to any inert polymer by choosing appropriate block copolymers and antibacterial agents to attain desirable biocidal activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

Methods and Results: Viruses were inoculated into liquids and viral titres were determined at various times postinoculation. The viruses were stable in distilled-deionized (dd) water at 4 degrees C during the 21 days of the study. The inactivation rates of VEE and SV in dd water at 21 and 30 degrees C were very similar (between 0.12 and 0.14 log(10) per day), while MS2 was three-fold slower. In tap water (chlorine content between 4 and 5 ppm) at 21 degrees C, VEE and SV were inactivated at twice the rate measured in dd water. Conclusions: The inactivation rates of VEE and SV were similar to each other and faster than MS2 in all liquids tested. Significance and Impact of the Study: VEE is likely to remain viable for many days after release into water, snow, or even chlorinated tap water. SV can be used to estimate the persistence of VEE in liquids, but using MS2 as a simulant would overestimate of the stability of VEE.", "label": 1}

Viable Salmonella were recovered from all of the inoculation sites (intact fruit surface, punctures, shaves, and stem scars) even after treatment with chlorinated water for up to 120 s at either 25 or 35 \u00b0C. Generally, the highest Salmonella recovery came from puncture wounds and the lowest from the intact surfaces. After 120 s at 25 \u00b0C, 4.9 to 5.8 log10 units were recovered from the wounds. Populations recovered after the 30-s treatment at 35 \u00b0C ranged from 4.1 log10 cfu/mL for intact surfaces to 6.0 log10 cfu/mL in the puncture wounds. At 60- and 120-s treatment times, all wounds had higher mean populations than tomatoes with intact surfaces. Although greater Salmonella survival was assocd. with shorter exposure to the chlorine, water chlorination cannot completely eliminate contamination of tomato fruit by Salmonella, even on intact surfaces.

Recent results of the PRIME study indicate that increasing brain penetration of antibody drugs improves Alzheimer's treatment outcomes. New approaches are needed to better accomplish this goal. Based on prior evidence, the hypothesis that glycan modification alters antibody blood-brain barrier permeability was tested here. Methods The blood-brain barrier permeability coefficient Pe of different glycosylated states of anti-amyloid IgG was measured using in vitro models of brain microvascular endothelial cells. Monoclonal antibodies 4G8, with sialic acid, and 6E10, lacking sialic acid, were studied. The amount of sialic acid was determined using quantitative and semi-quantitative surface plasmon resonance methods. Results Influx of IgG was not saturable and was largely insensitive to IgG species and glycosylation state. By contrast, efflux of 4G8 efflux was significantly lower than both albumin controls and 6E10. Removal of ?2,6-linked sialic acid group present on 12% of 4G8 completely restored efflux to that of 6E10 but increasing the ?2,6-sialylated fraction to 15% resulted in no change. Removal of the Fc glycan from 4G8 partially restored efflux. Alternate sialic acid groups with ?2,3 and ?2,8 linkages, nor on the Fc glycan, were not detected at significant levels on either 4G8 or 6E10. Conclusions These results support a model in which surface-sialylated 4G8 inhibits its own efflux and that of asialylated 4G8. General significance Glycan modification has the potential to increase antibody drug penetration into the brain through efflux inhibition.", "label": 0}

These foods may be consumed raw or minimally processed, and therefore can be a vehicle of several pathogens. The microorganisms most frequently linked to produce-related outbreaks include bacteria (Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and Shigella spp.), viruses and parasites. There are many traditional technologies to reduce/eliminate the microorganisms present in food products. However, further research on this topic is still required, since none of the methods reported can control all the parameters necessary to achieve produce with an extending shelf-life, without compromising its quality. In this paper, an analysis of the alternative and traditional methodologies is made, pointing out the significant advantage and limitations of each technique. Industrial relevance The significant increase in the incidence of foodborne outbreaks caused by contaminated minimally processed produce in recent years has become of extreme importance. The extensive knowledge of gentle (non-thermal) processes to enhance safety, preservation and shelf-life of these products is crucial for the food industry. This manuscript presents non-thermal processes that have shown efficient microbial reductions on fresh produce and highlights some of their challenges and limitations.", "label": 0}

One-minute free chlorine treatments at concentrations of 33 and 189 ppm reduced virus binding in the PGM-MB assay by 1.48 and 4.14 log(1)(0), respectively, suggesting that chlorine is an efficient sanitizer for inactivation of human norovirus (HuNoV). Five minute treatments with 5% trisodium phosphate (pH~12) reduced HuNoV binding by 1.6 log(1)(0), suggesting that TSP, or some other high pH buffer, could be used to treat food and food contact surfaces to reduce HuNoV. One minute treatments with 350 ppm chlorine dioxide dissolved in water did not reduce PGM-MB binding, suggesting that the sanitizer may not be suitable for HuNoV inactivation in liquid form. However a 60-min treatment with 350 ppm chlorine dioxide did reduce human norovirus by 2.8 log(1)(0), indicating that chlorine dioxide had some, albeit limited, activity against HuNoV. Results also suggest that peroxyacetic acid has limited effectiveness against human norovirus, since 1-min treatments with up to 195 ppm reduced human norovirus binding by <1 log(1)(0). Hydrogen peroxide (4%) treatment of up to 60 min resulted in minimal binding reduction (~0.1 log(1)(0)) suggesting that H(2)O(2) is not a good liquid sanitizer for HuNoV. Overall this study suggests that HuNoV is remarkably resistant to several commonly used disinfectants and advocates for the use of chlorine (sodium hypochlorite) as a HuNoV disinfectant wherever possible.", "label": 1}

Excystation and mouse infectivity were comparatively evaluated to assess oocyst viability. Ozone and chlorine dioxide more effectively inactivated oocysts than chlorine and monochloramine did. Greater than 90% inactivation as measured by infectivity was achieved by treating oocysts with 1 ppm of ozone (1 mg/liter) for 5 min. Exposure to 1.3 ppm of chlorine dioxide yielded 90% inactivation after 1 h, while 80 ppm of chlorine and 80 ppm of monochloramine required approximately 90 min for 90% inactivation. The data indicate that C. parvum oocysts are 30 times more resistant to ozone and 14 times more resistant to chlorine dioxide than Giardia cysts exposed to these disinfectants under the same conditions.

Wounded sites in cantaloupe rind were inoculated with S. poona only, S. poona and mold simultaneously, or mold followed by S. poona 3 days later. A cylindrical plug (ca. 3 cm diameter and 4 cm deep) of inoculated tissue extending from the rind surface into edible tissues was removed and cut transversely into four segments (0\u20131, 1\u20132, 2\u20133, and 3\u20134 cm) representing distances from the rind surface. Regardless of the type of inoculum or the time of storage subsequent to inoculation, the pH of the tissues was significantly higher (P?0.05) as the distance from the rind surface increased. Test microorganisms and naturally occurring microorganisms on the rind surface which were introduced into internal tissues during wounding, as well as physiological changes in cantaloupe tissue, contributed to these changes. C. cladosporioides and P. expansum were recovered from the inoculated rind and underlying tissues throughout storage at 20 \u00b0C for 10 days. S. poona persisted and grew in wounds on rinds on inoculated cantaloupe incubated at 20 \u00b0C. Recovery of S. poona from tissues 3\u20134 cm below the inoculated wound supports the hypothesis that it can migrate from the site of inoculation into adjacent mesocarp tissues. Survival and migration of S. poona into the internal tissues of cantaloupes were enhanced by co-inoculation with C. cladosporioides and, to a lesser extent, P. expansum. Consumption of cantaloupes from which diseased tissue has been removed is not advisable because S. poona and perhaps other enteric pathogens may still be present in remaining tissues.", "label": 0}

The truck was carrying approximately 350 preweaned Holstein calves. An outbreak investigation was led by KDHE with assistance from the county health department; six cases of cryptosporidiosis were identified among the 15 emergency responders. No additional primary cases with this exposure or secondary cases were identified. Disease was associated with carrying calves (relative risk [RR] = 3.0) and contact with fecal matter (RR = 4.5). The calves were aged <10 days and reportedly suffered from scours (diarrheal disease), which is often caused by Cryptosporidium spp., a chlorine-tolerant protozoan parasite. Because of the age of the calves and the conditions at the rollover scene, a high potential existed for fecal contamination and subsequent transmission of Cryptosporidium. This outbreak is the first report of both law enforcement and volunteer emergency responders contracting cryptosporidiosis, with transmission of Cryptosporidium attributed solely to direct contact with animals and their feces. Human illness resulting from contact with animals during an emergency response might be minimized if 1) all responders are aware of the potential for zoonotic transmission, 2) education is provided on proper animal handling including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment, and 3) responders practice thorough hand hygiene and decontaminate clothing and equipment following contact with feces.", "label": 0}

The swelling power, breakdown, setback, and peak and final viscosities decreased according to the RVA (P<0.05). The gel strength increased under low-intensity oxidative treatments and decreased under high-intensity oxidative treatments. Oxidative treatment decreased the digestibility of gelatinized potato starch.

Contaminated seeds containing approximately 1.5 x 10(7) CFU/g of Salmonella were treated with ASC or Ca(OCl)(2) at different concentrations and for different periods of time. Results showed that the efficacy of ASC and Ca(OCl)(2) for elimination of Salmonella on contaminated seeds could be improved greatly by extending the treatment time from the traditional 15 to 45 min. Treatment of seeds with 800 ppm of ASC for 45 min reduced the number of Salmonella by 3.9 log units, approximately 1.2 log units higher than that treated with 20000 ppm of Ca(OCl)(2). Treatment of seeds with a lower concentration (100 to 400 ppm) of ASC for 45 min reduced the number of Salmonella by 1.3 to 2.2 log units. Soaking alfalfa seeds in 800 ppm of ASC for 45 min did not affect seed germination. However, soaking seeds in 20000 ppm of Ca(OCl)(2) for 45 min reduced seed germination by 20%. Unlike Ca(OCl)(2), antimicrobial efficiency of ASC was not affected by pre-exposure to alfalfa seeds.

In the present study, its affinity to the progesterone receptor (PgR), the androgen receptor (AR) and the estrogen receptor (ER) was re-evaluated and compared to those obtained for progesterone (P) and several progestins. The characteristics of binding to the PgR in rat uterus were determined and Ki were found to be roughly similar with 22.8 and 34.3 nM for NOMAC and P, respectively. The binding characteristics of 3H-NOMAC were also determined and compared to that of 3H-ORG2058 with Kd of 5 and 0.6 nM, respectively for rat uterus and 4 and 3 nM, respectively for human T47-D cells. Structure\u2013affinity and \u2013activity relationships were studied on a variety of compounds related to NOMAC in order to assess its specificity as a progestin. The effects of NOMAC on the binding of androgen to the AR were investigated, using rat ventral prostate as target model. Contrary to what was observed for MPA, the RBA of NOMAC was found to decline with time, showing anti-androgenic rather than androgenic potential, a result that was confirmed in vivo. Regarding the ER, since none of the progestins were able to compete with estrogen for binding in rat uterus as well as in Ishikawa cells, the induction of alkaline phosphatase activity (APase) was used as an estrogen-specific response. It confirmed the intrinsic estrogenicity of progestins derived from 19-nor-testosterone (19NT), norethisterone acetate (NETA), levonorgestrel (LNG) or norgestimate (NGM) and others. In contrast, all P and 19-norP derivatives remained inactive. Finally, to complete this overview of NOMAC at the sex steroid receptor levels, the lack of estrogenic or estrogenic-like activity was checked out in different in vitro models. Data from this study have demonstrated that NOMAC is a progestin that has greater steroid receptor selectivity compared to MPA or some other synthetic progestins.

In the presence of 526 mg KCl/L, the virus was inactivated ?7-fold faster by Cl than in the absence of KCl. At a level of 21 mg/L, KCl did not significantly potentiate the virucidal activity of Cl in purified water. Although poliovirus 1 was inactivated almost 3-fold faster by Cl in borate-buffered purified water than in purified water, the buffer did not alter the extent of potentiation by KCl. Most Cl exists as OCl- at pH 9.0. Tap water markedly potentiated the poliovirucidal effectiveness of Cl at pH 9.0. For the same degree of virucidal potentiation of Cl at this pH, a considerably greater quantity of KCl was required in purified water than the total salt content that appeared to be present in the tap water.

Although the concept of PDT has existed for a long time now, it has never made a solid entrance into the clinical management of cancer. This is likely due to secondary tissue reactions, such as inflammation and neoangiogenesis. The recent development of clinically effective angiogenesis inhibitors has lead to the initiation of research on the combination of PDT with such angiostatic targeted therapies. Preclinical studies in this research field have shown promising results, causing a revival in the field of PDT. This review reports on the current research efforts on PDT and vascular targeted combination therapies. Different combination strategies with angiogenesis inhibition and vascular targeting approaches are discussed. In addition, the concept of increasing PDT selectivity by targeted delivery of photosensitizers is presented. Furthermore, the current insights on sequencing the therapy arms of such combinations will be discussed in light of vascular normalization induced by angiogenesis inhibition.", "label": 0}

In the European guidelines to evaluate the fungicidal activity of a biocide, the critical step concerning the preparation of conidial suspensions is cumbersome and time-consuming. The aims of this study were to evaluate a simplified procedure to prepare conidial suspensions to test a biocide in comparison with the recommended one and to investigate the in vitro activity of seven biocides by the suspension-neutralization method against A. fumigatus clinical isolates. The proposed simplified procedure proved reproducible, gave the same results and was quicker than that described in the European guidelines. Benzalkonium chloride (0(.)25%), glutaraldehyde (11(.)6%), polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine (1% available iodine) and polyester glycol iodine (0(.)18% available iodine) showed biocidal activity in <= 5 min contact time, and chlorine (0(.)14% available CI) and chlorhexidine (0(.)06%) after 15 min and 30-60 min, respectively. In contrast, chloramine-T (0(.)01%) did not show biocidal activity. In addition, a simplified and reproducible procedure may be used for testing the fungicidal activity of new compounds or combined formulations. In conclusion, the biocides tested, which are commonly used in hospital settings, were shown to display biocidal activity against A. fumigatus and a simplified procedure may be adopted for testing the fungicidal activity of new compounds.", "label": 1}

The 6 cleaning steps (alkali, surfactant, acid, enzyme, a second surfactant, and sanitizer treatment) revealed resistance of isolates in both planktonic and biofilm-embedded cell states. The most effective step was the acid treatment, which resulted in 4.54 to 7.90 and 2.09 to 5.02 log reductions of the planktonic and biofilm-embedded cells, respectively. Although the sanitizer step causing a reduction of 4.91 to 8.33 log in the case of planktonic cells, it was less effective against the biofilm-embedded cells, resulting in a reduction of 0.59 to 1.64 log.

Using Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, we investigated how some cations and anions influenced the antimicrobial activity of HBD-2. This activity, measured in 10 mM phosphate buffer at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, reduced significantly in the presence of 100 and 150 mM sodium or potassium chloride. The reduction was not significantly different when the total amounts of sodium and potassium ions were equal. The kind and the valence of anions (chlorine and sulfate ions) did not affect the bactericidal activity as long as the concentrations of sodium ions were equal. Divalent ions (calcium and magnesium ions) added to 10 mM of Tris buffer significantly inactivated HBD-2 at much lower concentrations (more than or equal to 0.01 mM and 0.05 mM, respectively) than the monovalent ions did. These findings suggest that HBD-2 kills the bacteria through at least two phases, which are affected independently by either monovalent or divalent ions and unaffected by anions.", "label": 0}

The current investigation was designed to assess the response of the mouse for comparative purposes. Respiratory physiological responses were measured in female C57Bl/6J mice exposed to 0.8 to 4.0 ppm chlorine gas. Chlorine was a potent sensory irritant with an RD50 of 2.3 ppm. The gas produced airway obstruction as indicated by a concentration-dependent increase in specific airways resistance (sRaw) during the 15-min exposure. At 0.8 ppm, chlorine produced only mild sensory irritation (<20% change in breathing frequency) and a 65% increase in sRaw. Pretreatment with atropine was without effect on the obstructive response, suggesting a lack of involvement of muscarinic cholinergic pathways. Pretreatment with the sensory nerve toxin, capsaicin, dramatically reduced both the sensory irritation and obstructive responses to chlorine, suggesting the involvement of sensory nerves. Studies were also performed using the surgically isolated upper respiratory tract of the anesthetized mouse. Chlorine was efficiently scrubbed from the airstream (>97%) in that site and produced an obstructive response that was of sufficient magnitude to account for the entire response observed in the intact animal. In summary, chlorine gas produces an immediate nasal obstructive response in the mouse that appears to be similar to that in the human.", "label": 0}

This study assessed the long-term efficacy of copper-silver ionization as a disinfection method in controlling Legionella in hospital water systems and reducing the incidence of hospital-acquired legionnaires' disease. A standardized, evidence-based approach to assist hospitals with decision making concerning the possible purchase of a disinfection system is presented. DESIGN: The first 16 hospitals to install copper-silver ionization systems for Legionella disinfection were surveyed. Surveys conducted in 1995 and 2000 documented the experiences of the hospitals with maintenance of the system, contamination of water with Legionella, and occurrence of hospital-acquired legionnaires' disease. All were acute care hospitals with a mean of 435 beds. RESULTS: All 16 hospitals reported cases of hospital-acquired legionnaires' disease prior to installing the copper-silver ionization system. Seventy-five percent had previously attempted other disinfection methods including superheat and flush, ultraviolet light, and hyperchlorination. By 2000, the ionization systems had been operational from 5 to 11 years. Prior to installation, 47% of the hospitals reported that more than 30% of distal water sites yielded Legionella. In 1995, after installation, 50% of the hospitals reported 0% positivity, and 43% still reported 0% in 2000. Moreover, no cases of hospital-acquired legionnaires' disease have occurred in any hospital since 1995. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the final step in a proposed 4-step evaluation process of disinfection systems that includes (1) demonstrated efficacy of Legionella eradication in vitro using laboratory assays, (2) anecdotal experiences in preventing legionnaires' disease in individual hospitals, (3) controlled studies in individual hospitals, and (4) validation in confirmatory reports from multiple hospitals during a prolonged time (5 to 11 years in this study). Copper-silver ionization is now the only disinfection modality to have fulfilled all four evaluation criteria.", "label": 0}

We believe that biofilms also are associated with chronic rhinosinusitis. No information is known regarding the presence of biofilms in chronic rhinosinusitis. Study design and setting With institutional review board approval, tissue was obtained from consenting chronic rhinosinusitis patients who were undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Specimens were taken bilaterally from the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses. Inclusion criteria consisted of a positive diagnosis with pathologic tissue confirmation of chronic inflammation. Diagnosis was based on patient history, physical exam, and coronal sinus CT findings. Once collected, the specimens were labeled and fixed in formalin. The specimens were subsequently dehydrated, with successive immersions in increasing concentrations of diluted ethanol. The specimens were allowed to air dry and then were affixed to aluminum stubs with colloidal carbon. The sample surface was coated with a gold and palladium layer. The specimens were examined under an electron microscope. Areas of interest were photographed. Results Specimens from 5 patients were examined. All revealed bacterial biofilms. Invariably, biofilms were seen in the ethmoid, as well as in other samples. Denudation of ciliated and goblet cells was noted in all specimens. Biofilms resembled that of Staphylococcus species. Unidentified biofilms were also seen. Conclusions This is the first documentation of biofilms in association with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Design Retrospective medical record review. Methods All patients with positive blood cultures for CoNS obtained between Jan.2008 and Apr. 2009 at Ohud Hospital, a referral hospital at Al Madinah Al Munawara, KSA Results Of 5263 blood cultures drawn from patients seen at Ohud Hospital,. 593 had positive findings (11.3%). CoNS were isolated in 266 (5.05%) which represents 44.8% of the total positive blood cultures during the study period. Of the 266 positive blood culture patients for CoNS, only 185 medical were available for review. The blood culture contamination rate was 4.7% of the total blood cultures obtained. True bacteremia represented 8.1%. Resistance to Oxacillin was high (75.9%). Vancomycin was used in 36.8% of the patients. 92.9% of the study population was treated by multiple antibiotics. This resulted in additional cost of 3210.2 Saudi Riyals (SR) per patient. Conclusion CoNS are the major microbial contaminant of blood cultures. The most important factors in reducing BC contamination are: strict adherence to the most effective sterile venipuncture techniques by well trained health care workers. Clinical as well as laboratory criteria may help distinguishing true bacteremia from contaminated blood cultures. There is a tendency for clinicians to overuse antibiotics in patients with CoNS from blood cultures. However, as is found in this the vast majority of CoNS are still encountered as contaminants. This should be borne in mind and patients with isolates of CoNS from blood cultures should be carefully evaluated before instituting therapy to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics, especially Vancomycin and the consequent increase of antibiotic resistance in hospitals.", "label": 0}

Despite this promise, lower reservoir contamination is thought to be a contributing factor to the decline in the effectiveness being seen over time. A novel silver-impregnated ceramic torus that can be placed in the lower reservoir was designed to minimize this contamination. This study uses a one-year randomized trial to compare the relative effectiveness of the CWF+torus design with a standard CWF and point-of-use chlorination. The effectiveness of each technology was measured at project inception and subsequently after six and 12months. Results indicate that the toruses, as designed, are not able to consistently maintain lower-reservoir silver concentrations above those of the simple CWF design and are hence unable to prevent contamination. Furthermore, after six months, only 65% of households that used point-of-use chlorination maintained sufficient chlorine levels above the 0.2mg/L needed to be effective. All three technologies showed statistically equivalent log removal efficiencies for total coliform bacteria and all three declined in effectiveness over the first six months. Combined average log removal efficiencies for all three technologies ranged from 2.22 +/- 0.21 initially but declined to 1.45 +/- 0.35 after six months and to 1.42 +/- 0.29 after oneyear.", "label": 0}

Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts are particularly more resistant than Giardia lamblia cysts to removal and inactivation by conventional water treatment (coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and chlorine disinfection); therefore, extensive research has been focused on the optimization of treatment processes and application of new technologies to reduce concentrations of viable/infectious oocysts to a level that prevents disease. The majority of the data on the performance of treatment processes to remove cysts and oocysts from drinking water have been obtained from pilot-tests, with a few studies performed in full-scale conventional water treatment plants. These studies have demonstrated that protozoan cyst removal throughout all stages of the conventional treatment is largely influenced by the effectiveness of coagulation pretreatment, which along with clarification constitutes the first treatment barrier against protozoan breakthrough. Physical removal of waterborne Crytosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts is ultimately achieved by properly functioning conventional filters, providing that effective pretreatment of the water is applied. Disinfection by chemical or physical methods is finally required to inactivate/remove the infectious life stages of these organisms. The effectiveness of conventional (chlorination) and alternative (chlorine dioxide, ozonation and ultra violet [UV] irradiation) disinfection procedures for inactivation of Cryptosporidium has been the focus of much research due to the recalcitrant nature of waterborne oocysts to disinfectants. This paper provides technical information on conventional and alternative drinking water treatment technologies for removal and inactivation of the protozoan parasites Cryptosporidium and Giardia.", "label": 1}
{"id": "1033", "title": "K+-Cl- cotransport mediates the bactericidal activity of neutrophils by regulating NADPH oxidase activation", "abstract": "Neutrophilic phagocytosis is an essential component of innate immunity. During phagocytosis, the generation of bactericidal hypochlorous acid (HOCl) requires the substrates, Cl- and superoxide produced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase to kill the internalized pathogens. Here we show that the neutrophilic K+-Cl- cotransporter (KCC) constitutes a Cl- permeation pathway and mediates the bactericidal activity by regulating NADPH oxidase activation. Dihydroindenyloxy alkanoic acid (DIOA), a KCC inhibitor, suppressed the toxin- or chemical-induced efflux of 36Cl- or 86Rb+, and diminished the production of superoxide in human and murine neutrophils. Inhibition of KCC activity or knockdown of KCC expression, in particular KCC3, reduced the phosphorylation as well as the membrane recruitment of oxidase components. Activated neutrophils displayed a significant colocalization of KCC3 and early endosomal marker, indicating that KCC3 could be localized on the phagosomes once neutrophils are activated. The NADPH oxidase activity and the phosphorylation level of oxidase component were 50% lower in the neutrophils isolated from KCC3-/- mice than in the neutrophils isolated from KCC3+/+ mice. Mortality rate after intraperitoneal challenge with Staphylococcus aureus was higher in KCC3-/- mice, and the bacterial clearance was impaired in the survivors. We conclude that, in activated neutrophil, NADPH oxidase complexes are associated with KCC3 at the plasma membrane and are internalized to form phagosomes, where KCC activity and expression level affect the production of oxidants. \u00a9 2012 The Authors.

Mammalian cells (V79 CHO), in contrast, are more sensitive to H2O2 than to HOCl.

{"id": "7559", "title": "Activity of selected oxidizing microbicides against the spores of Clostridium difficile: relevance to environmental control", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is an increasingly common nosocomial pathogen, and its spores are resistant to common environmental surface disinfectants. Many high-level disinfectants (eg, aldehydes) are unsuitable for environmental decontamination because they need several hours of contact to be sporicidal. This study tested the potential of selected oxidative microbicides to inactivate C. difficile spores on hard surfaces in relatively short contact times at room temperature. METHODS: The spores of a clinical isolate of C. difficile were tested using disks (1 cm diameter) of brushed stainless steel in a quantitative carrier test. The spores of C. sporogenes and Bacillus subtilis, common surrogates for evaluating sporicides, were included for comparison. The clostridia were grown separately in Columbia broth (CB), and B. subtilis was grown in a 1:10 dilution of CB. Each disk received 10 microL test spores with an added soil load, and the inoculum was dried. One disk each was placed in a glass vial and overlaid with 50 microL test formulation; controls received an equivalent volume of normal saline with 0.1% Tween 80. At the end of the contact time the microbicide was neutralized, the inoculum recovered from the disks by vortexing, the eluates were membrane filtered, and the filters placed on plates of recovery medium. The colony-forming units (CFU) on the plates were recorded after 5 days of incubation. The performance criterion was > or = 6 log(10) (> or = 99.9999%) reduction in the viability titer of the spores. The microbicides tested were domestic bleach with free-chlorine (FC) levels of 1000, 3000, and 5000 mg/L; an accelerated hydrogen peroxide (AHP)-based product with 70,000 mg/L H2O2 (Virox STF); chlorine dioxide (600 mg/L FC); and acidified domestic bleach (5000 mg/L FC). RESULTS: Acidified bleach and the highest concentration of regular bleach tested could inactivate all the spores in < or = 10 minutes; Virox STF could do the same in < or = 13 minutes. Regular bleach with 3000 mg/L FC required up to 20 minutes to reduce the viability of the all the spores tested to undetectable levels; chlorine dioxide and the lowest concentration of regular bleach tested needed approximately 30 minutes for the same level of activity. CONCLUSIONS: Acidified bleach, Virox STF, and regular bleach (3000-5000 mg/L FC) could inactivate C. difficile spores on hard environmental surfaces in approximately 10 to 15 minutes under ambient conditions. All of these products are strong oxidizers and should be handled with care for protection of staff, but acidified and regular bleach with high levels of FC also release chlorine gas, which can be hazardous if inhaled by staff or patients.", "label": 1}

Microbial reductions of the total aerobic count obtained after the different treatments varied between 0.11 and 3.29 log colony-forming units (cfu)/g. Whether or not a decontamination step induced significant changes in the sensory attributes of grated carrots is highly dependent on the type and concentration of disinfectant. To maintain the nutritional value, the influence of the decontamination agents on carotenoid content, alpha-tocopherol content, total phenols, and antioxidant capacity was studied. Besides the part of the nutrients that was leached away from the cutting areas by water, the nutrient losses caused by adding sanitizers were rather limited. Compared with the untreated carrots alpha-tocopherol content was, however, significantly reduced when 250 ppm of peroxyacetic acid (-80%) or 200 ppm of sodium hypochlorite (-59%) was used. Additional losses in carotenoid content were caused by contact with chlorine dioxide gas (-9%). On the condition of an optimized decontamination process toward time and concentration, the microbial quality of fresh-cut carrots could be improved without negatively influencing their sensory quality and nutrient content.", "label": 1}

The treatments of ClO2 at 20 and 40 ppm for 3,6 and 10 min or at 5 and 10 ppm for 6 and 10 min with 170-kHz ultrasonication caused 3.115 to 4.253 log reductions in Salmonella and 2.235 to 3.865 log reduction in E. coli O157:H7 on innoculated apples. Using combined ClO2 and ultrasonication to treat 4.48 x 10(4-) CFU/g Salmonella 1.07 x 10(5) CFU/g E. coli O157:H7-innoculated lettuce, the bacterial reductions were 2.257 to 2.972 and 1.357 to 2.264 and log, respectively. the residual ClO2 decreased with interesting treatment times, over 80% of ClO2 was detected after the 3-min treatment, and more than 70% remained after the 10-min treatment time.

{"id": "5628", "title": "Toxic metal resistance in biofilms: diversity of microbial responses and their evolution", "abstract": "Since biofilms are an important issue in the fields of medicine and health, several recent microbiological studies have focused on their formation and their contribution to toxic compound resistance mechanisms. In this review, we describe how metals impact biofilm formation and resistance, and how biofilms can help cells resist toxic metals. First, the organic matrix acts as a barrier isolating the cells from many environmental stresses. Secondly, the metabolism of the cells changes, and a slowly-growing or non-growing sub-population of cells known as persisters emerges. Thirdly, in the case of multispecies biofilms, metabolic interactions are developed, allowing cells to be more persistent or to have greater capacity to survive than a single species biofilm. Finally, we discuss how the high density of the cells may promote horizontal gene transfer processes, resulting in the acquisition of new features. All these crucial mechanisms enable microorganisms to survive and colonize toxic environments, and probably accelerate ongoing evolutionary processes.", "label": 0}

A total of 450 casing segments representing 10 hanks were used over five testing days and arranged in a randomized block split-plot design. For each treatment, pH, temperature, actual ozone concentration, bursting strength, maximum rupture force, and L*, a* and b* color space values were determined. The bursting strength and the maximum rupture force values suggested that casings can be treated by ozone up to 2 h without deterioration. After ozone treatments, changes in L*, a* and b* color space values made the casings appear lighter than the control samples. Microbiological studies showed that I and 2 h ozonation reduced counts of Escherichia coli biotype 1, which expressed green fluorescent protein, by 0.4 and 0.6 log(10) CFU/25.4 cm casing, respectively.

Ground beef was inoculated with 7 Log CFU/g of E. coli O157:H7 isolated from domestic pigs and was then subjected to ozone exposure (10x10(-6) kg O-3 h(-1)) at 4 degrees C for 3 d. E. coli O157:H7, total aerobic and anaerobic bacterial growth and oxidative properties including instrumental color changes, TBARS, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity were evaluated. Ozone exposure significantly prohibited (p<0.05) the growths of E. coli O157:H7, total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in ground beef samples during storage. Ozone exposure reduced (p<0.05) the CIE a* value of samples over storage time. The CIE L* and CIE b* values of the samples fluctuated over storage time, and ozone had no clear effect. Ozone exposure increased the TBARS values during 1 to 3 d of storage (p<0.05). The CAT and GPx enzyme activities were not affected by ozone exposure until 2 and 3 d of storage, respectively. This study provides information about the use of ozone exposure as an antimicrobial agent for meat under refrigerated storage. The results of this study provide a foundation for the further application of ozone exposure by integrating an ozone generator inside a refrigerator.

This study aimed to investigate the influence of various factors on Staphylococcus aureus attachment and biofilm formation on food contact materials and to determine sanitizing efficacy. The factors examined were contact materials (stainless steel, SUS; glass, GL; polypropylene, PP; and polyethylene, PE), surface conditions (smooth vs. scratched and with vs. without biofilms), and chemical sanitizers (70% ethanol and 200 ppm chlorine). Sanitization more efficiently lowered S. aureus counts on SUS and GL than on PP and PE. Sanitization efficacy of ethanol was better than that of chlorine. Surfaces with scratches and biofilms were the most resistant to sanitization methods. The use of low-adherent materials in food facilities, the selection of effective sanitizing methods, and the application of proper cleaning and disinfection procedures for food contact surfaces are essential for ensuring food safety. Practical applicationsControl of S. aureus on food contact surface is important to reduce cross-contamination in the foodservice industry. Hydrophobic and rough food contact surfaces promote S. aureus adherence and biofilm formation. Ethanol can be an effective chemical sanitizer against S. aureus biofilm, regardless of the material or roughness of the food contact surfaces. The use of hydrophilic materials, frequent replacement of equipment, and selection of proper sanitizing methods are recommended to prevent foodborne illnesses.", "label": 1}
{"id": "4893", "title": "Investigation of gaseous ozone for MRSA decontamination of hospital side-rooms", "abstract": "A domestic, gaseous ozone generator was investigated for use in the decontamination of hospital side-rooms that have housed patients colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Three models of bacterial contamination were used. These were exposed to ozone generation in a standard hospital side-room for 4 and 7 h. A methicillin-sensitive and a methicillinresistant strain of S. aureus were compared. Ozone concentrations of 0\u00b714 ppm were reached, levels which are sufficient to cause mild pulmonary toxicity. Bacterial counts were reduced in the vicinity of the gas generator in most instances, but the effect elsewhere in the room was, at best, limited. MRSA appeared more resistant to the effects of ozone than methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. We conclude that the device tested would be inadequate for the decontamination of such hospital side-rooms.", "label": 0}

Treating of the cheese rind at the end of ripening may be a tool to improve cheese safety. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a high pressure water spray washing technology in reducing Listeria load from Gorgonzola cheese rind without using oxidizing agents. The surface of Gorgonzola cheese was contaminated (up to 107 cfu g?1 of scraped rind) with a mixture of four strains of Listeria innocua. The count of Listeria was made by scraping (2 mm depth) the rind of the cheese. The contaminated cheeses were then washed at different pressures, ranging from 1 to 5 MPa for 1 min. The lower the pressure, the lower was the removal of Listeria. A reduction of up to 99.89% was achieved washing the cheese at 5 MPa, followed by rinsing at 1 MPa for 1 min. Changing the inoculum size (102, 104, and 107 cfu g?1), did not change the efficacy of Listeria removal, when the same water pressure was applied. The washing of Gorgonzola cheese with pressurized jet water, without adding any preservative to the water, can be considered a further important physical hurdle, in controlling pathogenic bacteria and improving cheese safety.", "label": 0}
{"id": "5567", "title": "Sources and contamination routes of microbial pathogens to fresh produce during field cultivation: A review", "abstract": "Foodborne illness resulting from the consumption of contaminated fresh produce is a common phenomenon and has severe effects on human health together with severe economic and social impacts. The implications of foodborne diseases associated with fresh produce have urged research into the numerous ways and mechanisms through which pathogens may gain access to produce, thereby compromising microbiological safety. This review provides a background on the various sources and pathways through which pathogenic bacteria contaminate fresh produce; the survival and proliferation of pathogens on fresh produce while growing and potential methods to reduce microbial contamination before harvest. Some of the established bacterial contamination sources include contaminated manure, irrigation water, soil, livestock/ wildlife, and numerous factors influence the incidence, fate, transport, survival and proliferation of pathogens in the wide variety of sources where they are found. Once pathogenic bacteria have been introduced into the growing environment, they can colonize and persist on fresh produce using a variety of mechanisms. Overall, microbiological hazards are significant; therefore, ways to reduce sources of contamination and a deeper understanding of pathogen survival and growth on fresh produce in the field are required to reduce risk to human health and the associated economic consequences.", "label": 0}

{"id": "4173", "title": "Biofilm development within a larval rearing tank of the tropical rock lobster, Panulirus ornatus", "abstract": "The role of bacterial biofilms in disease processes is becoming increasingly recognised in both clinical and environmental settings. Biofilm development within a rearing tank of the tropical rock lobster Panulirus ornatus was studied to evaluate if the biofilm is a reservoir for potentially pathogenic bacteria that cause mass larval mortalities. Within a 5000\u00a0L larval rearing tank, fiberglass microscope slides were systematically distributed during a standard rearing attempt to assess biofilm development. Culture-based counts for two media types, TCBS and Marine Agar (MA), demonstrated increased bacterial densities until days 11 and 13 respectively. For both media types, a drop in the plate counts was followed by a subsequent increase towards the end of the experiment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that cell densities decreased between days 13 and 17, most likely due to sloughing of the biofilm into the water column. SEM images revealed distinct changes in dominant morphologies reflecting a succession of bacterial populations. A dynamic succession of microbial species during biofilm development was also demonstrated using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiling of bacterial 16S rRNA genes in combination with statistical ordination analysis. Prominent changes in the DGGE profiles coincided with the decrease in bacterial numbers observed by SEM and plating on MA between days 13 and 17. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) identified ?-Proteobacteria as being numerically abundant in the biofilm. This was supported by results from DGGE analysis, which retrieved only sequences affiliated with ?- and ?-Proteobacteria. DGGE bands affiliated with Vibrio became dominant towards the end of the larval run (days 21 to 24). A Vibrio harveyi strain isolated from the biofilm late in the larval rearing trial (day 24) demonstrated increased larval mortality in small scale phyllosoma survival studies. The detection of Vibrionaceae at the end of the larval trial coincided with mass phyllosoma mortality and show that the biofilm is a reservoir for potentially pathogenic bacteria.", "label": 0}

The results showed that ClO2 treatments at concentrations of 16 and 20 mg/L maintained pH, total soluble solid contents and firmness better than other samples at the end of the storage. Untreated samples and samples treated with 25 mg/L ClO2, had higher weight loss and respiration rate than other treated fruit during storage. Steady-state equilibrium was achieved in the passive modified atmosphere packages of ClO2 treated cherries between the second and the fifth weeks of storage. No significant differences were found between untreated and treated samples except for 25 mg ClO2 treated fruit regarding electrolyte leakage. The L* values of ClO2 treated samples ascended with increasing concentrations of ClO2 at each sampling day. ClO2 treatments significantly affected the redness (a*) values of fruit during storage. ClO2 treatment at the concentration of 25 mg/L had a deleterious effect on cherry color and anthocyanins. The cherries treated with 16 and 20 mg/L ClO2 tended to have higher scores than other treated and untreated samples in all sensory attributes. No mold growth was visually observed during the first two weeks of storage in treated cherries except 4 and 8 mg/L ClO2 treated samples. In summary, our work has led us to conclude that combined use of passive modified atmosphere and ClO2 treatments at a concentrations of 16 and 20 mg/L has potential to maintain the quality of sweet cherry.", "label": 0}

{"id": "4379", "title": "Chlorination-induced genotoxicity in the mussel Perna viridis: assessment by single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay", "abstract": "Mussels are important fouling organisms in the cooling water systems of coastal power plants. Continuous low-dose chlorination (CLDC) is being practiced as an effective method to control mussel biofouling in power plant cooling water systems. CLDC effectively controls mussel fouling by discouraging larval settlement rather than by killing the larvae or adults. Mussels are an integral part of the natural benthic community in the receiving water body where the coolant water is discharged. Hence, from a toxicological point of view, they can serve as both target and non-target organisms. Previous researchers have indicated that chlorine residual, rather than elevated temperature, can be the major stress factor in the effluents released from coastal power plants. However, very little data are available on the sub-lethal effects of low level chlorination on representative benthic fauna. In this study, we used native and transplanted mussels (Perna viridis) to study lethal and sub-lethal effects of chlorination in the cooling water circuit of an operating power plant. Experiments involving comet assay suggested that CLDC can cause DNA damage in treated mussels. However, activation of DNA repair appeared to get initiated after the accrued damage reached a threshold. The results indicate that, at chlorine residual levels observed at the discharge point, exposure to chlorinated effluents is unlikely to cause significant genetic damage to mussels in the recipient water body.[on SciFinder (R)]", "label": 0}

Lewis lung carcinoma greater than 1 cm in the shortest dimension was treated percutaneously with 20 mA for 15 min. Separate groups were given one or more than one (two or three) percutaneous electrical treatments (PET). A third group was given sham electrical treatment, and a fourth group had surgical excision of the tumor. Animals in both PET groups survived longer and had smaller primary tumors at death compared with the sham group. PET did not alter the systemic course of the disease, judged by lung and spleen weights and by histological observation of the extent of metastatic burden in the lung. Surgery resulted in long-term survival of 17% and an increase in average survival time compared with both PET and sham treatment. PET produced rapid and polarity-dependent alterations in physiological solutions in vitro, and it is likely that similar electrochemical processes mediated the observed reduction in tumor growth. PET is potentially useful as an adjuvant modality because it reduces local tumor mass but does not alter the extent of metastasis.", "label": 0}
{"id": "3401", "title": "Electrochemical treatment as a pre-oxidative step for algae removal using Chlorella vulgaris as a model organism and BDD anodes", "abstract": "An experimental work is presented in this paper on the inactivation of algae through electrochemical treatment. A green algae (Chlorella vulgaris) was adopted as a model. A commercial filter-press electrochemical reactor (Electro MP-Cell), equipped with a boron doped diamond (BDD) anode and a stainless steel cathode, was used to perform the electrolysis. The cell was inserted in a hydraulic circuit and used in either a closed loop, as a recirculating batch reactor, or in the continuous mode. The effects of current density and hydrodynamics were studied, as well as the formation of active chlorine and other chloride oxidation products. Active chlorine concentrations on the order of 0.3 mmol dm(-3) were obtained when algae were not present in the initial solution (batch experiments) or in the feed (continuous experiments). In the presence of algae, the value was 0.03 mmol dm(-3). The highest values were measured with i = 75 A cm(-2) and flow conditions corresponding to a Reynolds number of 100 (batch experiments) or a hydraulic residence time of 4 min (continuous experiments). The process led to the total inactivation of algae when 100 mg dm(-3) of chlorides was present in the solution, which is a typical value for natural waters. The results indicated that, under the adopted conditions, the prevailing mechanism was inactivation by means of long-life oxidants electrogenerated. A simple model of continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) in-series was adopted to account for the non-ideal flow conditions in the continuous experiments, which was able to interpret the data under all the conditions tested.

{"id": "198", "title": "Evidence of Naturalized Stress-Tolerant Strains of Escherichia coli in Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants", "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Escherichia coli has been proposed to have two habitats-the intestines of mammals/birds and the nonhost environment. Our goal was to assess whether certain strains of E. coli have evolved toward adaptation and survival in wastewater. Raw sewage samples from different treatment plants were subjected to chlorine stress, and approximately 59% of the surviving E. coli strains were found to contain a genetic insertion element (IS30) located within the uspC-flhDC intergenic region. The positional location of the IS30 element was not observed across a library of 845 E. coli isolates collected from various animal hosts or within GenBank or whole-genome reference databases for human and animal E. coli isolates (n = 1,177). Phylogenetics clustered the IS30 element-containing wastewater E. coli isolates into a distinct clade, and biomarker analysis revealed that these wastewater isolates contained a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) biomarker pattern that was specific for wastewater. These isolates belonged to phylogroup A, possessed generalized stress response (RpoS) activity, and carried the locus of heat resistance, features likely relevant to nonhost environmental survival. Isolates were screened for 28 virulence genes but carried only the fimH marker. Our data suggest that wastewater contains a naturalized resident population of E. coli We developed an endpoint PCR targeting the IS30 element within the uspC-flhDC intergenic region, and all raw sewage samples (n = 21) were positive for this marker. Conversely, the prevalence of this marker in E. coli-positive surface and groundwater samples was low (</=5%). This simple PCR assay may represent a convenient microbial source-tracking tool for identification of water samples affected by municipal wastewater. IMPORTANCE: The results of this study demonstrate that some strains of E. coli appear to have evolved to become naturalized populations in the wastewater environment and possess a number of stress-related genetic elements likely important for survival in this nonhost environment. The presence of non-host-adapted strains in wastewater challenges our understanding of using E. coli as a microbial indicator of wastewater treatment performance, suggesting that the E. coli strains present in human and animal feces may be very different from those found in treated wastewater.", "label": 1}

{"id": "1467", "title": "Impact of prechlorination on organophosphorus pesticides during drinking water treatment: Removal and transformation to toxic oxon byproducts", "abstract": "Prechlorination is commonly used to minimize operational problems associated with biological growth as well as taste and odor control during drinking water treatment. However, prechlorination can also oxidise micropollutants into intermediate byproducts. This could impose profound effects on the safety of the finished water if the transformed byproducts are more toxic and less removable. This study investigated the effect of prechlorination on decomposition and subsequent removal of the four organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs): chlorpyrifos, diazinon, malathion and tolclofos-methyl using a simulated conventional water treatment process of powdered activated carbon assisted coagulation-sedimentation-filtration (PAC-CSF) and postchlorination. It was found that, following prechlorination, not only did the percentage of OPPs oxidation vary significantly, but also the concentration of transformed oxons, which are more toxic than their parent compounds, increased as the major identified oxidation byproducts in water. Removal of these oxons proved to be more difficult by the PAC-CSF than their parent OPPs, because they are more water soluble and more hydrophilic. Both the OPP oxidation and oxon formation increased with chlorine dose during prechlorination. Meanwhile, the continuing chlorination of OPPs by residual free chlorine during PAC-CSF further complicated the pesticide removal processes, generally resulting in a gradually increased formation of oxons. Moreover, in the final treatment stage of postchlorination, the more chlorine-reactive pesticides, malathion and diazinon, were completely oxidised and the formation of corresponding oxons was increased with the prechlorine dose. In contrast, a certain amount of the less chlorine-reactive pesticide tolclofos-methyl still remained in solution after postchlorination, accompanied by an increased formation of tolclofos-methyl oxon with prechlorine dose. Since the oxons are resistant to further oxidation and less adsorbable during the PAC-CSF process, the gross removal of these pesticides and their oxons decreased with increase of the prechlorine dose. This led to an accumulation of the more toxic oxons in the finished water, especially at higher chlorine doses during prechlorination. The significance of this work is the demonstration that, under circumstances where prechlorination is used and source water contains traces of OPPs, alternative practices should be prioritized to avoid the potential risks involved in consumption of the treated water.", "label": 0}
{"id": "2431", "title": "Degradation of Amino Acids and Structure in Model Proteins and Bacteriophage MS2 by Chlorine, Bromine, and Ozone", "abstract": "Proteins are important targets of chemical disinfectants. To improve the understanding of disinfectant-protein reactions, this study characterized the disinfectant:protein molar ratios at which 50% degradation of oxidizable amino acids (i.e., Met, Tyr, TIT, His, Lys) and structure were observed during HOC1, HOBr, and O-3 treatment of three well-characterized model proteins and bacteriophage MS2. A critical question is the extent to which the targeting of amino acids is driven by their disinfectant rate constants rather than their geometrical arrangement. Across the model proteins and bacteriophage MS2 (coat protein), differing widely in structure, methionine was preferentially targeted, forming predominantly methionine sulfoxide. This targeting concurs with its high disinfectant rate constants and supports its hypothesized role as a sacrificial..gctufg,r4a antioxidant. Despite higher HOC1 and HOBr rate constants with histidine and lysine than for tyrosine, tyrosine generally was degraded in preference to histidine, and to a lesser extent, lysine. These results concur with the prevalence of geometrical motifs featuring histidines or lysines near tyrosines, facilitating histidine and lysine regeneration upon Cl[+1] transfer from their chloramines to tyrosines. Lysine nitrile formation occurred at or above oxidant doses where 3,5-dihalotyrosine products began to degrade. For O-3, which lacks a similar oxidant transfer pathway, histidine, tyrosine, and lysine degradation followed their relative O-3 rate constants. Except for its low reactivity with lysine, the O-3 doses required to degrade amino acids were as low as or lower than for HOCl or HOBr, indicating its oxidative efficiency.

Most of these stresses, such as ionizing radiation, heavy metals and organic chemicals, represent potent DNA-damaging agents. Here, we show that exposure to NaCl, the stress that is not thought to cause direct DNA damage, results in an increase in the level of strand breaks and homologous recombination rates (RRs) in Arabidopsis thaliana plants. The effect of salt stress on the RR was found to be primarily associated with Cl(-) ions, since exposure of plants to Na(2)SO(4) did not increase the RR, whereas exposure to MgCl(2) resulted in an increase. Changes in the number of strand breaks and in the RR were also paralleled by transcriptional activation of AtRad51 and down-regulation of AtKu70. The progeny of exposed plants exhibited higher RRs, higher expression of AtRad51, lower expression of AtKu70, higher tolerance to salt and methyl methane sulfate (MMS) stresses, as well as a higher increase in RR upon further exposure to stress. Our experiments showed that NaCl is a genotoxic stress that leads to somatic and transgenerational changes in recombination rates, and these changes are primarily triggered by exposure to Cl(-) ions.", "label": 0}

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Ag(l) was observed to be between 0.1 mg Ag/I and 0.05 mg Ag/I following a 24-h incubation period at 25degreesC. Additional forms of silver that were effective included Ag2O a protein-based silver and AgCl(s). All of these forms of silver resulted in MICs that, were comparable to Ag(I). Predictions from a chemical equilibrium modelling system indicated that a silver-histidine complex may have contributed to the observed bactericidal activity. A MIC for colloidal metallic silver (Ag-0) was not observed up to a total silver concentration of 82 mg Ag/I-the highest concentration evaluated. Moreover, aqueous silver was not detected at this total silver concentration. it was concluded from these findings that cationic Ag(I) or Ag(I)-complexes were responsible for the bactericidal activity of silver. in the batch systems evaluated, the MICs increased with time, over a 72-h incubation period, to values above the US Environmental Protection Agency Secondary Standard for silver, for all forms of silver tested.

{"id": "5336", "title": "Older and new purine nucleoside analogs for patients with acute leukemias", "abstract": "Purine nucleoside analogs (PNAs) compose a class of cytotoxic drugs that have played an important role in the treatment of hematological neoplasms, especially lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. All PNA drugs have a chemical structure similar to adenosine or guanosine, and they have similar mechanisms of action. They have many intracellular targets: they act as antimetabolites, competing with natural nucleosides during DNA or RNA synthesis, and as inhibitors of key cell enzymes. In contrast to other antineoplastic drugs, PNAs act cytotoxically, both in the mitotic and quiescent cell cycle phases. In the last few years, three PNAs have been approved for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies and other hematological disorders: 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA), fludarabine and pentostatin. 2-CdA and fludarabine are also active in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These drugs, in combination with cytarabine and other agents, are commonly used as salvage regimens in relapsed or refractory AML. Moreover, the addition of 2-CdA to the standard induction regimen is associated with an increased rate of complete remission and improved survival of adult patients with AML. More recently three novel PNAs have been synthesized and introduced into clinical trials: clofarabine, nelarabine and forodesine. Clofarabine is the most promising PNA in current clinical trials in pediatric and adult patients with acute leukemias. Nelarabine is more cytotoxic in T-lineage than in B-lineage leukemias. Clofarabine and nelarabine have been approved for the treatment of refractory patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma. Clofarabine is also an active drug in AML treatment when administered either alone or in combination regimens as front-line treatment and in relapsed or refractory patients. Unlike other PNA, forodesine is not incorporated into DNA but displays a highly selective purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitory action. Forodesine is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of T-cell malignancies, including T-cell ALL. This article summarizes recent achievements in the mechanism of action, pharmacological properties and clinical activity and toxicity of PNAs, as well as their emerging role in lymphoid and myeloid acute leukemias.", "label": 0}

Five ecotypes were collected from one saline site, two moderately saline sites, and two highly saline sites. Anatomical adaptations in each ecotype critically supported the physiol., but the adaptations were of specific nature depending on the type of each site's normal habitat conditions. Higher salinities resulted in increased Na+, Cl-, Mg2+, Ca2+ and K+ content in root and shoot. At root level, some specific structural modifications like increased sclerification in cortical and pith regions, endodermal thickness, and no. and size of xylem vessels are vital for water conservation under osmotic stress. Several characteristics were promising for increasing the plants ability to deal with osmotic stress, including at the stem level, increased sclerification, stem area, cortical region thickness and vascular bundle area, and at the leaf level, significant structural modifications such as leaf thickness, epidermal thickness, sclerenchymatous area, cortical area, metaxylem area and bulliform cell area were promising.

The RF power of deposition was applied as the operational parameter of the process, and optical properties, transmittance in particular, of the films were utilized as criterion for their selection. Photo-induced properties of the films, including a change of water wettability under the effect of illumination and photocatalytic activity, were studied. A substantial decrease of water contact angle was observed upon the irradiation of the films with ultraviolet (UV) light. The largest increase of water wettability was obtained for the surfaces of the films exhibiting the highest value of index of refraction. Testing of the photocatalytic activity of the titanium oxide films comprised UV light-induced decomposition of benzene and aniline dissolved in water and bactericidal action against the Escherichia coli strain DH5 alpha. The largest bactericidal efficiency was observed in the case of the film characterized by the highest index of refraction. Auger Electron Spectroscopy measurements have shown that the film composition is that of a nearly stoichiometric TiO2, with a small chlorine contamination. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, it was soon found that many of these technologically valuable chemicals suffered from a major disadvantage in that they resisted biodegradation and that the continued use of these compounds would lead to their persistence and accumulation in the environment and thus enter the human food chain. Despite regulatory bans or strict limits on usage being imposed on organochlorine pesticides in most countries, these compounds continue to be detected in measurable amounts in the eco-system including marine life. In general, organochlorine levels in fish intended for human consumption are low and probably below levels likely to adversely affect human health. Populations at higher risk than most people are those subsisting largely on fish and other marine life. Additionally, fish oils obtained from contaminated fish, if consumed in substantial quantities by infants and young children, might present potential health problems if levels are not continually regulated. Behavioral and neurological effects have been reported in children and ascribed to the consumption of PCB contaminated diet including fish. Another current major human health concern, yet to be resolved, about organochlorine contaminants in the human diet relates to the potential ability of many of these chemicals at low doses to act as \u201cendocrine disruptors\u201d.", "label": 0}

Testing complex mixtures present a formidable scientific problem since most recently available toxicological data has been obtained from single substance studies and is not simply transferable to mixtures of chemicals. Although there are no special strategies and standard protocols available for determining toxic and genotoxic effects of complex mixtures, the fundamental concepts of evaluation are the same as those for single substances [1]. The focus of interest of the submitted paper is the genotoxicological characterisation of a complex mixture of mostly perhalogenated hydrocarbons which is generated as a waste product from the plasma etching process in the semiconductor industry. By use of several in vitro test systems (comet assay and micronucleus test), the clastogenic potency of the mixture was tested in various human cell types (lymphocytes and normal bronchial epithelial cells) and in rat hepatocytes. Results demonstrated that the complex perhalogenated hydrocarbons mixture causes DNA single-strand breaks and micronuclei formation, and direct concentration-to-effect correlations were proved in all experiments. The presence of an external metabolising system (S9 mix from rat hepatocytes) in human cell culture systems did not cause any change of the observed effects when compared to experiments performed in the absence of the S9 mix. Therefore, we conclude that the mixture acts as direct genotoxicant and that there is no detoxification by the external enzyme system. Further, convincing and reproducible results of the in vitro comet assay and the micronucleus assay in primary human cell cultures indicated these tests may be utilized for the genotoxicological analyses of complex mixtures with concern to human health hazard.", "label": 0}

Although conceptually very attractive, removal and biodegradation of chlorinated pollutants by plants is a rather slow and inefficient process resulting in incomplete treatment and potential release of toxic metabolites into the environment. In order to overcome inherent limitations of plant metabolic capabilities, plants have been genetically modified, following a strategy similar to the development of transgenic crops: genes from bacteria, fungi, and mammals involved in the metabolism of organic contaminants, such as cytochrome P-450 and glutathione S-transferase, have been introduced into higher plants, resulting in significant improvement of tolerance, removal, and degradation of pollutants. Recently, plant-associated bacteria have been recognized playing a significant role in phytoremediation, leading to the development of genetically modified rhizospheric and endophytic bacteria with improved biodegradation capabilities. Transgenic plants and associated bacteria constitute a new generation of genetically modified organisms for efficient and environmental-friendly treatment of polluted soil and water.

Seed surfaces are complex, and different seed varieties have different surface topographies. As a result, a sanitizer effective in eliminating pathogenic bacteria on one seed may not be as effective when applied to another seed. The objectives of this research were (i) to investigate the efficacy of malic acid and thiamine dilaurylsulfate (TDS) combined treatments for inactivation of E. coli O157:H7 strain 87-23 on alfalfa, broccoli, and radish seeds, (ii) to quantify surface roughness of the seeds, and (iii) to determine the correlation between microbial removal and surface roughness. The surface roughness of each seed type was measured by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and surface profilometry. Surface roughness (Ra) values of the seeds were then calculated from CLSM data. Seeds inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 87-23 were washed for 20 min in malic acid and TDS solutions and rinsed for 10 min in tap water. Radish seeds had the highest Ra values, followed by broccoli and alfalfa seeds. A combination of 10% malic acid and 1% TDS was more effective than 20,000 ppm of Ca(OCl)(2) for inactivation of E. coli O157:H7 87-23 on broccoli seeds, while the inactivation on radish and alfalfa seeds was not significantly different compared with the 20,000-ppm Ca(OCl)(2) wash. Overall, a negative correlation existed between the seeds' Ra values and microbial removal. Different seeds had different surface roughness, contributing to discrepancies in the ability of the sanitizers to eliminate E. coli O157:H7 87-23 on the seeds.

Methods and Results: Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were developed in tryptic soy broth containing vertically suspended aluminium or stainless steel plates. Biofilms were exposed to a mixed sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide solution as a sanitizer for 1, 5 and 20 min. The sanitizer was then neutralized, the cells dislodged from the test surfaces, and viable cells enumerated. Cell morphologies were determined using scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cell viability was determined by confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). Biofilm removal was monitored by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometry. Cell numbers were reduced by 5-log to 6-log after 1 min exposure and by 7-log after 5 min exposure to Ox-B. No viable cells were detected after a 20 min exposure. Treatment with equivalent concentrations of sodium hypochlorite reduced viable numbers by 3-log to 4-log after 1 min exposure and by 4-log to 6-log after 5 min, respectively. A 20 min exposure achieved a 7-log reduction. Hydrogen peroxide at test concentration treatments showed no effect. FTIR analysis of treated pseudomonad biofilms on aluminium or stainless steel plates showed either a significant reduction or complete removal of biofilm material after a 5 min exposure to the mixed sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide solution.

The viability of the oocysts after the treatments was assessed using propidium iodide and a flow cytometer.

Treatment with chlorine and microwave heating was significantly more effective than microwave heating alone and inactivated 98% of the oocysts. The study indicates that C. parvum oocysts are sensitive to heat and, to some extent, to blast freezing, but are resistant to chlorine.

In contrast, tobramycin-treated biofilm cells maintained their membrane integrity better than chlorine- or silver-treated ones, as evidenced by imaging by both CLSM and epifluorescence microscopy. Combined and sequential treatments with silver and tobramycin showed an enhanced antimicrobial efficiency of more than 200%, while the antimicrobial activity of either chlorine or tobramycin was antagonized when the agents were used in combination. This observation makes sense when the different oxidative reactivities of chlorine, silver, and tobramycin are considered. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}

The structures of the mixed ligand complexes were established by anal. and spectral techniques. They were screened for in vitro antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi by disk diffusion method. The interaction of metal complexes with CT-DNA was investigated by UV-vis, cyclic voltammetry, viscosity and thermal denaturation studies. DNA interaction studies suggest that metal complex binds to calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) through intercalation mode. Superoxide dismutase activity of these complexes has also been studied. The free ligands and their metal complexes have been tested for in vitro antioxidant activity by the redn. of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH). The antioxidant activities of the complexes were studied and compared with the activity of ascorbic acid. Cu(II) complex showed superior antioxidant activity than other complexes.

After spin drying, treated leaves were analyzed periodically during 14 days of storage at 4 degrees C for Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, total coliforms, mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria, and yeasts and molds. Treatment effects on color and texture of leaves also were determined. Sporan alone (1,000S), Sporan plus acetic acid (1,000SV), and cinnamaldehyde-Tween (800T) reduced E. coli O157:H7 by more than 3 log CFU/g (P < 0.05), and 1,000SV treatment reduced Salmonella by 2.5 log CFU/g on day 0. E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella populations on treated spinach leaves declined during storage at 4 degrees C. The 1,000SV treatment was superior to chlorine and other treatments for reducing E. coli O157:H7 during storage. Saprophytic microbiota on spinach leaves increased during storage at 4 degrees C but remained lower on leaves treated with Sporan (800S) and Sporan plus acetic acid (1,000SV) than on control leaves. The color and texture of Sporan-treated leaves were not significantly different from those of the control leaves after 14 days.

Factors contributing to this increase may include changes in agronomic and processing practices, an increase in per capita consumption of raw or minimally processed fruits and vegetables, increased international trade and distribution, and an increase in the number of immuno-compromised consumers. A general lack of efficacy of sanitizers in removing or killing pathogens on raw fruits and vegetables has been attributed, in part, to their inaccessibility to locations within structures and tissues that may harbor pathogens.

{"id": "7144", "title": "Relationship between antibiotic- and disinfectant-resistance profiles in bacteria harvested from tap water", "abstract": "Chlorination is commonly used to control levels of bacteria in drinking water; however, viable bacteria may remain due to chlorine resistance. What is concerning is that surviving bacteria, due to co-selection factors, may also have increased resistance to common antibiotics. This would pose a public health risk as it could link resistant bacteria in the natural environment to human population. Here, we investigated the relationship between chlorine- and antibiotic-resistances by harvesting 148 surviving bacteria from chlorinated drinking-water systems and compared their susceptibilities against chlorine disinfectants and antibiotics. Twenty-two genera were isolated, including members of Paenibacillus, Burkholderia, Escherichia, Sphingomonas and Dermacoccus species. Weak (but significant) correlations were found between chlorine-tolerance and minimum inhibitory concentrations against the antibiotics tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and amoxicillin, but not against ciprofloxacin; this suggest that chlorine-tolerant bacteria are more likely to also be antibiotic resistant. Further, antibiotic-resistant bacteria survived longer than antibiotic-sensitive organisms when exposed to free chlorine in a contact-time assay; however, there were little differences in susceptibility when exposed to monochloramine. Irrespective of antibiotic-resistance, spore-forming bacteria had higher tolerance against disinfection compounds. The presence of chlorine-resistant bacteria surviving in drinking-water systems may carry additional risk of antibiotic resistance.", "label": 1}

In this study, the efficacy of plant extracts as alternatives for disinfection of cilantro, parsley, and spinach that were artificially contaminated with Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Shigella sonnei was determined. Edible plant extracts obtained using ethanol as the extraction solvent were tested to determine the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and those that exhibited the lowest MBC were selected for further studies. Leaves of fresh greens were washed with sterile water and dried. For seeding, leaves were submerged in suspensions of 2 different concentrations of bacteria (1.5 x 10(8) and 1 x 10(5) ), dried, and then stored at 4 degrees C until use. To determine the effects of the extracts, inoculated leafy greens were submerged in a container and subjected to treatments with chlorine, Citrol(R), or selected plant extracts. Each treatment type was stored at 4 degrees C for 0, 1, 5, and 7 d, and the bacterial counts were determined. From the 41 plant extracts tested, the extracts from oregano leaves and from the peel and pulp of limes were found to be as effective as chlorine or Citrol(R) in reducing by > 2 logs, the population of pathogenic bacteria on leafy greens and therefore, may be a natural and edible alternative to chemicals to reduce the risk of Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7 and S. sonnei contamination on leafy vegetables. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The antimicrobial efficacy of the extracts of Mexican lime and oregano was clearly demonstrated on cilantro, parsley, and spinach.

Sporicidal testing standards to validate the claims of sporicidal activity are an important tool in the evaluation of commercial sporicides. Within Europe there are a number of sporicidal testing standards which are often used to validate the claims of commercial sporicides. However, the extent to which these standards reflect the practical application of sporicides in healthcare settings is limited since they employ long contact times (?30 min) and do not involve surface contamination. Alternative international standards are available which employ contaminated carriers rather than spore suspensions, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is currently developing a unified set of standards which are more realistic in their design than the currently available European standards. This paper reviews the currently available testing standards for sporicides, highlighting the key procedural differences between them and the extent to which they reflect the practical application of sporicidal products. Some of the common problems and errors associated with the application of the European sporicidal standard methods are also highlighted and discussed.

Oysters spiked with FCV and MNV were fermented with 5% or 10% salt at 18\u00a0\u00b0C for 15 days, and MNV and FCV titers, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) populations, pH, and enzymatic activity were measured at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 days post-fermentation (DPF). Reductions in MNV and FCV were greater in 5% NaCl-supplemented oysters than in 10% NaCl-supplemented oysters. In 5% NaCl oysters, MNV and FCV titers significantly decreased by 1.60\u00a0log and 3.01\u00a0log, respectively, at 15 DPF.

After disinfection, the bacteria are harvested by mech. sepg. them from the carrier surface to form a suspension of cells in a diln. tube. Bacterial clumps in the tube are disaggregated using mech. or chem. techniques, thereby creating a well-mixed suspension of single cells suitable for enumeration. Efficacy is quantified by comparing the viable cell count for a disinfected carrier to the viable cell count for sham-disinfected (control) carrier. A test is said to be biased (invalid) if the obsd. efficacy measure is systematically higher or lower than the true efficacy. It is shown here for the first time that the bias attributable to the harvesting and disaggregating steps of a disinfectant test can be measured. For some conventional biofilm harvesting and disaggregating techniques, lab. checks showed either negligible bias or important bias, depending on the disinfectant. Quant. bias checks on the harvesting and disaggregating steps are prudent for each combination of carrier material, microorganism, and disinfectant. The quant. results should be augmented by microscopic examn. of harvested disinfected and control carriers and of the disaggregated suspensions. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}

Oxidants also transform organic material and form disinfection by-products (DBPs), many of which are halogenated and cyto- and genotoxic. Only a handful of assays have been used to compare DBP toxicity, and researchers are unsure which DBP(s) drive the increased cancer risk associated with drinking chlorinated water. The most extensive data set employs an in vitro model cell, Chinese hamster ovary cells. Traditionally, most DBP research focuses on the threat to human health, but the effects on aquatic species exposed to DBPs in wastewater effluents remain ill defined. We present the developmental toxicity for 15 DBPs and a chlorinated wastewater to a model aquatic vertebrate, zebrafish. Mono-halogenated DBPs followed the in vivo toxicity rank order: acetamides > acetic acids > acetonitriles similar to nitrosamines, which agrees well with previously published mammalian in vitro data. Di- and tri-halogenated acetonitriles were more toxic than their mono-halogenated analogues, and bromine- and iodine-substituted DBPs tended to be more toxic than chlorinated analogues. No zebrafish development effects were observed after exposure to undiluted or non-concentrated, chlorinated wastewater. We find zebrafish development to be a viable in vivo alternative or confirmatory assay to mammalian in vitro cell assays.

Plants were treated with increasing concns. of Cd in the soln. (0 (control), 1, 10 and 100 ?M). As expected, concn. of Cd in the leaves gradually increased with Cd concn. in the soln. In order to reveal the main Cd storage compartment space within the leaves a relative element distribution (pool) was calcd. based on concns. of elements in specific leaf tissues and their wt. portions. Where present at detectable levels, Cd accumulated in the epidermal tissues (at 10 ?M), but the contribution of epidermal pool decreased with increasing Cd concn. in soln. (at 100 ?M). The opposite was obsd. for the mesophyll pool. In addn., in Cd treated plants, a significant decrease in mesophyll Fe pool and an increase in the epidermal Fe pool were obsd. Similar effect was seen for Mn pool at 100 ?M Cd treatment accompanied by increasing Zn epidermal pool with increasing Cd in nutrient soln. Altogether these results indicate repartitioning of essential mesophyll cation pools (e.g., Fe, Mn and possibly Zn) when increasing Cd contents, that are instead more intensively stored in the epidermal cells. These results confirmed micro-PIXE as effective and powerful technique providing essential information on metal localization, repartitioning and major elemental stores in plants on the tissue levels that were not accessible using classical anal. techniques and thus complementing current understanding of plant metal tolerance mechanisms as a whole.

This article also aims to discuss potential future directions on the development of more potent and specific uracil analogues for various biological targets. Uracils are considered as privileged structures in drug discovery with a wide array of biological activities and synthetic accessibility. Antiviral and anti-tumour are the two most widely reported activities of uracil analogues however they also possess herbicidal, insecticidal and bactericidal activities. Their antiviral potential is based on the inhibition of key step in viral replication pathway resulting in potent activities against HIV, hepatitis B and C, the herpes viruses etc. Uracil derivatives such as 5-fluorouracil or 5-chlorouracil were the first pharmacological active derivatives to be generated. Poor selectivity limits its therapeutic application, resulting in high incidences of gastrointestinal tract or central nervous toxicity. Numerous modifications of uracil structure have been performed to tackle these problems resulting in the development of derivatives exhibiting better pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties including increased bioactivity, selectivity, metabolic stability, absorption and lower toxicity. Researches of new uracils and fused uracil derivatives as bioactive agents are related with modifications of substituents at N1, N3, C5 and C6 positions of pyrimidine ring. This review is an endeavour to highlight the progress in the chemistry and biological activity of the uracils, predominately after the year 2000.

{"id": "3145", "title": "Evaluating the effectiveness of common disinfectants at preventing the propagation of Mycobacterium spp. isolated from zebrafish", "abstract": "Mycobacteriosis is a bacterial disease that is common in captive, wild and research fish. There is no one causative agent of mycobacteriosis, as several strains and species of Mycobacterium have been identified in zebrafish. With increased usage and investment in wild-type and mutant zebrafish strains, considerable value is placed on preserving zebrafish health. One control measure used to prevent mycobacterial spread within and between zebrafish facilities is egg disinfection. Here we investigate the effectiveness of three disinfectants [chlorine bleach, hydrogen peroxide, and povidone-iodine (PVPI)] commonly included in egg disinfection protocols for laboratory fish as well as aquaculture fish and compare the knockdown effect of these treatments on Mycobacterium spp. in vitro. Despite current usage, comparison of these disinfection regimes' abilities to prevent mycobacterial growth has not been tested. We found that the germicidal effect of different disinfectants varies by Mycobacterium spp. Hydrogen peroxide was the least effective disinfectant, followed by unbuffered chlorine bleach, which is commonly used to disinfect embryos in zebrafish facilities. Disinfection with 25ppm PVPI for 5min was very effective, and may be an improved alternative to chlorine bleach for embryo disinfection. Results from this study can be utilized by laboratory fish facilities in order to prevent the spread of mycobacteriosis in research fish.", "label": 0}

The study was carried out comparatively with PVC bags with which these drugs are incompatible. The drugs were diluted in 5% dextrose or in 0.9% sodium chloride isotonic solutions. Solutions were stored during 8 or 48 h with or without any protection against light. Remaining concentrations of drug were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) during the storage. The admixtures were also monitored for precipitation, color change and pH. Whatever the isotonic solution used, the loss of drugs is in discredit of the use of PVC bags for their storage. So, these three drugs would not be stored in PVC bags. In multilayer bags, no loss of drugs and no color change were detected throughout the storage period. pH values were stable during the same storage period. These three drugs were compatible with multilayer bags in all tested conditions for 8 or 48 h. The leaching of the plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), that is incorporated into PVC to make the bags soft and pliable was not detected in the three drug solutions during storage period. Our study confirms that these three drugs are incompatible with PVC bags, on the contrary the new materiel tested was proved to be interesting for drug storage.", "label": 0}

Twenty-four triazolylthioacetamides were prepared and evaluated as inhibitors of representatives of the three subclasses of M?Ls. All these compounds exhibited specific inhibitory activity against NDM-1 with an IC50 value range of 0.15-1.90 ?M, but no activity against CcrA, ImiS, and L1 at inhibitor concentrations of up to 10 ?M. Compounds 4d and 6c are partially mixed inhibitors with Ki values of 0.49 and 0.63 ?M using cefazolin as the substrate. Structure-activity relationship studies reveal that replacement of hydrogen on the aromatic ring by chlorine, heteroatoms, or alkyl groups can affect bioactivity, while leaving the aromatic ring of the triazolylthiols unmodified maintains the inhibitory potency. Docking studies reveal that the typical potent inhibitors of NDM-1, 4d and 6c, form stable interactions in the active site of NDM-1, with the triazole bridging Zn1 and Zn2, and the amide interacting with Lys 211 (Lys224).", "label": 0}

The standard qualitative procedure used by Health Canada differs to that used by the USDA for both quantitative and qualitative methods. A comparison of three methods was performed on raw poultry samples obtained from an abattoir to determine if one method is superior to the others in isolating Campylobacter from chicken carcass rinses. The average percent of positive samples was 34.72% (95% CI, 29.2\u201340.2), 39.24% (95% CI, 33.6\u201344.9), 39.93% (95% CI, 34.3\u201345.6) for the direct plating US method and the US enrichment and Health Canada enrichment methods, respectively. Overall there were significant differences when comparing either of the enrichment methods to the direct plating method using the McNemars chi squared test. On comparison of weekly data (Fishers exact test) direct plating was only inferior to the enrichment methods on a single occasion. Direct plating is important for enumeration and establishing the concentration of Campylobacter present on raw poultry. However, enrichment methods are also vital to identify positive samples where concentrations are below the detection limit for direct plating.", "label": 0}
{"id": "6840", "title": "Combretastatins: In vitro structure-activity relationship, mode of action and current clinical status", "abstract": "For the first time combretastatins were isolated from African willow tree Combretum Caffrum. Subsequent studies have shown the impact of combretastatin A4 phosphate, a water-soluble prodrug, on endothelial cells in tumor vascular system. The same effect was not observed in the vascular system. This selectivity is associated with combretastatins mechanism of action: binding to colchicine domain of microtubules, which affects the cytoskeleton functionality of immature endothelial cells. At the same time, combretastatins directly induce cell death via apoptosis and/or mitotic catastrophe pathways. The combination of both elements makes combretastatin an anticancer compound of high efficiency. The cis-configuration is crucial for its biological activity. To date, many derivatives were synthesized. The attempts to resolve spontaneous isomerization to less active trans-stilbene derivative are still in progress. This issue seems to be overcome by incorporation of the ethene bridge with heterocyclic moiety in combretastatins structure. This modification retains the cis-configuration and prevents isomerization. Nevertheless, combretastatin A4 phosphate disodium is still the most potent compound of this group. The combination therapy, which is the most effective treatment, includes combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P) and conventional chemotherapeutics and/or radiotherapy. CA4P is relatively well tolerated giving adverse events of moderate severity, which includes: nausea, vomiting, headache, and tumor pain.

Osbeck)] trees on sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) rootstock in response to increased levels of Na and Cl in irrigation water. Four levels of salt, ranging from the river-water control (0.44 dS/m) to 2.50 dS/m, were applied over a 9-year period through an under-tree microsprinkler system to trees in the Sunraysia area of the Murray Valley in south-eastern Australia. A salt-balance model showed that evapotranspiration was reduced by salinity, whereas leaching fractions increased from an average 24% in the control to 51% in the most saline treatment. The high leaching fractions were achieved as a result of freely draining soils and good irrigation management, and allowed us to maintain low to moderate levels of soil salinity throughout the trial and minimised the effect of salt treatment on fruit yield. Soil salinity increased almost linearly in response to irrigation-water salinity during the first year, and fluctuated seasonally thereafter; however, very few readings exceeded 3 dS/m, even in the highest treatments. By contrast, leaf Na and Cl concentrations in the highest salt treatment continued to increase over the first 4 years. The relationship between yield and soil salinity was extremely weak, but yield did decrease as foliar concentrations of Na and Cl increased: in Year 9, leaf Na in the highest treatment relative to the control was associated with a predicted reduction of 17% in yield and 59% in annual trunk-diameter growth.", "label": 0}

The activity can be restored by rechlorinating, and up to 2500 bed vols. of feed can be disinfected per cycle. The stability of the resins made with ?,?-diamines is enhanced because most of the N is combined in sulonamide groups at both ends of the diamine, providing enhanced crosslinkage.

The shortcomings of total chlorine residual as a measure of wastewater disinfection are discussed. The effect of pH is significant in the toxicity of chlorine compounds. Recent investigation to the formation of organic chloramines made the residual measurement technique more difficult to use in wastewater disinfection.

Experiments performed using wastewater samples showed that ORP is better correlated to the inactivation of coliform than total chlorine residual.

Experimental results revealed that the CT(product of disinfectant concentration and contact time) required to achieve a certain level of C. parvum inactivation was unique, thus demonstrating the validity of the CT concept for these single disinfectant and sequential disinfection processes for the range of experimental conditions investigated. Inactivation curves were represented accurately by a delayed Chick-Watson expression consistent with the CT concept. No pH dependence was observed for primary inactivation with ozone in the pH range of 6-10 or primary and secondary inactivation with monochloramine at pH values of 8 and 10. Oocyst resistance to chemical disinfectant attack was found to vary among oocysts lots as well as with oocyst aging within a given lot. The synergy observed for sequential disinfection with ozone/monochloramine suggested that monochloramine might be reacting with some of the same chemical constituents, both vital and nonvital, of the oocyst wall and/or cavity that also react with ozone. If so, partial completion of these reactions by the primary disinfectant would have resulted in the disappearance of the lag phase and the faster rate of inactivation observed for the secondary disinfectant.", "label": 0}

However, plant-based foods had not been traditionally recognized as a host for enteric pathogens until the elevated incidence of produce-related outbreaks became apparent. The survival dynamics of two cocktails of generic E. coli (environmental water, plant and soil isolates) and E. coli O157:H7 within the phyllosphere of Mizuna, Red Chard and Tatsoi during their production, harvest, minimal processing, packaging and storage over two greenhouse production cycles were studied. Genotyping of applied generic E. coli strains to evaluate their comparative survival and relative abundance in the phyllosphere by REP-PCR is also reported. The Mizuna, Red Chard and Tatsoi shoots were grown under standard greenhouse conditions and fertility management. Both E. coli cocktails were spray-inoculated separately and determined to result in an initial mean population density of log 4.2CFU/cm2. Leaves were harvested as mini-greens approximating commercial maturity, minimally processed in a model washing system treated with 3mg/L of ClO2 and stored for 7days at 5\u00b0C. Rapid decline of generic E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 populations was observed for all plant types regardless of the leaf age at the time of inoculation and the irrigation type across both seasonal growth cycle trials. The decline rate of the surviving populations for the fall season was slower than for the summer season. The minimal processing with 3mg/L of ClO2 was not sufficient to fully disinfect the inoculated leaves prior to packaging and refrigerated storage. Viable populations of E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 were confirmed throughout storage, including the final time point at the end of acceptable visual leaf quality. In this study, the ability of low populations of E. coli to survive during production and postharvest operations in selected mini-greens has been demonstrated. However, further field-based trials are needed to expand understanding of the post-contamination fate of enteric bacterial pathogens on leafy vegetables. In summary, this research work provides baseline data upon which to develop food safety preventive control guidance during the production and minimal processing of these crops. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.", "label": 0}

As a result of this investigation, the WSD has undertaken a 30-mo study to establish tech., engineering, environmental, and budgetary information required to reach an informed decision on how best to implement seawater RO desalination. The scope of the study includes (1) identifying prospective plant sites and conducting pilot trials to define RO design requirements at two sites, (2) identifying the most effective RO pre- and post-treatment processes, and (3) developing capital and operating cost ests. for one or more full-scale facilities. The pilot program is comprehensive and will involve testing for a continuous 12-mo period at two sep. locations (24 mo total) selected to represent the two types of water quality characteristic of Hong Kong's marine geog.: western region quality comprising variable salinity and turbidity influenced by runoff from the Pearl River and eastern region more representative of open ocean water. Further, the program will include water quality sampling at four addnl. marine locations to allow a comparison of water quality at six different areas of Hong Kong for future plant site considerations. A unique aspect of this pilot program will be the ability to assess the relative performance of microfiltration/ultrafiltration (MF/UF) with conventional granular media filtration for seawater RO (SWRO) pre-treatment. Each test site will be equipped with three individual SWRO trains, each of which is preceded by a different pre-treatment system. Pre-treatment systems to be simultaneously compared include pressurized MF/UF, submerged (or immersed) MF/UF, and two-stage granular media filtration. In addn., each SWRO train will include equal nos. of membrane modules from three different SWRO membrane manufacturers. This combination will allow independent evaluation of each pre-treatment system in combination with each type of SWRO membrane. This paper will present the many design issues considered throughout the site selection and pilot plant design process evaluated to provide WSD with the information necessary to cost and implement SWRO facilities and will describe the piloting protocol, specific test objectives and the design and operation of MF/UF and SWRO systems used in the testing. The information will benefit utilities and the wider water industry who are interested in how SWRO desalination can play a role in supplementing water resources and serve as an alternative supply of potable water. It will also identify the issues and costs that must be considered in implementing a desalination program. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

Data were collected over 12 weeks to determine the incidence of significant CoNS bacteremia versus that of pseudobacteremia (contaminants) and to evaluate drug therapy in patients with cultures positive for CoNS. In addition, the effectiveness of 0.2% chlorine peroxide as a bactericidal disinfectant was compared to that of 10% providone iodine. A total of 3,276 cultures of blood from 1,433 patients were evaluated in the study. Eighty-nine cultures were positive for skin flora, with 81 of 89 (91%) involving CoNS. The incidence of significant CoNS bacteremia was 20 of 81 (24.7%), that of indeterminate bacteremia was 10 of 81 (12.3%), and that of contamination was 59 of 81 (72.8%). The incidence of significant bacteremia involving CoNS was double the 10 to 12% rate based on previous estimations at our institutions. In tests with the two bactericidal disinfectants, 22 of 1,639 cultures (1.3%) in the chlorine peroxide group versus 37 of 1,637 (2.3%) in the providone iodine group were considered contaminated (P = 0.065). Rates of contamination for venipuncture versus catheter collection were not significantly different (P = 0.46). The overall contamination rate was 59 of 3,276 (1.8%), which is consistent with the lower end of published quality assurance benchmark standards. The low rate was believed to be due to the professional phlebotomy staff in our institutions. There was excellent agreement between retrospective analysis by reviewers, when formal criteria were used, and the attending physicians' intuitive clinical impressions in the classification of significant bloodstream infections (100% agreement) or contamination (95% agreement). However, physicians still used antimicrobial agents to treat nearly one-half of the patients with contaminated blood cultures, with vancomycin being misused in 34% of patients. In addition, 10% of patients with significant bacteremia were treated with inappropriate agents. There were no significant adverse events or prolonged hospital stays due to the unnecessary use of vancomycin; however, the additional costs of treating patients whose cultures contained CoNS contaminants was estimated to be $1,000 per patient. Measures to limit the unnecessary use of vancomycin (and other agents) are important.", "label": 0}

However, aspects of antibacterial property for various morphologies of CNT-based membranes and for the membrane leachate are still unclear. In this study, CNT-based membranes having different morphologies were fabricated and were directly exposed to bacterial cultures to test for bacterial viability. In addition, the antibacterial effect of membrane leachates was evaluated by comparing the viability of bacteria in leached and unleached waters. Neither the CNT-based membranes nor any leaching media inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 (PA14) growth. PA14 grown on any of the CNT-based membranes or in their leaching medium were not inactivated, and only PA14 that directly contacted to the surface of vertically aligned (VA) CNT membranes were inactivated. VA-CNT solid membranes which have the highest packing density of CNTs showed higher antibacterial property. They showed 23 and 6.4 times higher antibacterial property than deposited CNT and even VA-CNT forest membranes, respectively. Acidified membrane surfaces showed two times higher antibacterial property than non-acidified membranes. Especially when VA-CNT solid membranes were acidified, their antibacterial property increased 23-fold. After leaching tests, all VA-CNT membranes showed a 10% increase in antibacterial property. This study provides the first comprehensive comparison of the antibacterial property of diverse CNT-based membranes morphologies and further details the effect of acidification and leaching of CNT membranes on their antibacterial properties.", "label": 0}

We evaluated the applicability of a novel concentrator method for assessment of microbiological quality of alternative waters including secondary-treated wastewater (STWW), roof-harvest rainwater (RHW), and creek water (CW) in comparison to the standard membrane filtration method. Water samples of 100?ml were filtered through a 0.45??m membrane filter using a vacuum manifold or concentrated to ?250??l using the innovative concentrator. Then they were directly enumerated on specific agars, or enriched to monitor the populations of fecal bacterial indicators (Escherichia coli, enterococci, total and fecal coliforms) and bacterial pathogens (Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, and E. coli O157:H7). Presumptive pathogens were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR. In total, 25 samples of alternative water were analyzed including 7 STWW, 9 RHW, and 9 CW. No significant differences between both detection methods were observed when enumerating indicator bacterial populations and detecting the presence of pathogens in RHW and CW samples. Recovery of fecal coliforms in STWW samples by concentrator analysis was significantly lower than the membrane filtration technique. Results suggest that performance of the concentrator method is equivalent to membrane filtration method in determining the microbiological quality of CW and RHW waters; the type of the water sources may influence the accuracy and sensitivity of the concentrator analysis.", "label": 0}

During incubation of the sediment sample for 450 days with or without added cells, there was a decrease in the concn. of solvent-extractable chlorocatechols but not in that of the total chlorocatechols, including sediment-assocd. components. In the presence of azide, the decrease in the concns. of the former was eliminated or substantially decreased. Control expts. in which 3,4,5-trichlorocatechol was added to the sediment suspensions after 130 days showed that its dechlorination was accomplished not only by the added cells but also by the endemic microbial flora. Thus, endogenous chlorocatechols in the sediment were not accessible to microorganisms with dechlorinating activity. On the other hand, microorganisms were apparently responsible for decreasing the solvent extractability of the chlorocatechols, and this effect decreased with increasing length of exposure time. Similar expts. carried out for 70 days with the sediment interstitial water showed that the chlorocatechols that were known to be assocd. with org. matter were also inaccessible to microbial dechlorination. Expts. with model compds. in which 4,5,6-trichloroguaiacol and tetrachloroguaiacol were covalently linked to C2-guaiacyl residues showed that these compds. were resistant to O demethylation or dechlorination during incubation with a culture having these activities.

Using an efficacy criterion of a 3-log10 reduction in the titer of virus infectivity and regardless of the virus suspending medium (i.e., hard water, sterile water, and hard water with 5% fetal calf serum), only five disinfectants proved to be effective against the test virus at 1 min: 0.55% ortho-phthalaldehyde, 2.4% glutaraldehyde, 2.65% glutaraldehyde, approximately 6,000 ppm chlorine, and approximately 1,900 ppm chlorine. Four other disinfectants showed effectiveness under four of the five testing conditions: 70% ethanol, 65% ethanol with 0.63% quaternary ammonium compound, 79.6% ethanol with 0.1% quaternary ammonium compound, and 0.2% peracetic acid. Of the germicides suitable for use as an antiseptic, 70% ethanol achieved a 3-log10 reduction under four of the five test conditions. These results emphasize the need for proper selection of germicides for use in disinfecting noncritical surfaces and semicritical medical devices, such as applanation tonometers, in order to prevent outbreaks of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.", "label": 1}

A bacterial endospore is a metabolically dormant form of life that is much more resistant to heat, desiccation, lack of nutrients, exposure to UV and gamma radiation, organic chemicals, and oxidizing agents than is a vegetative cell. For example, the heat tolerance of endospores depends on multiple factors such as sporulation temperature, core dehydration, and the presence of minerals and small, acid-soluble proteins (SASPs) in the core.

Towards this aim, two already available CEN (Comite European de Normalisation) quantitative suspension test standards for the evaluation of bactericidal and virucidal activity of disinfectants and antiseptics for use in the veterinary field were modified by using agents and testing conditions representative of aquaculture conditions. For evaluating bactericidal activity, BS EN1656:2000 was modified to test disinfectant activity against Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida (ATCC 14174), Yersinia ruckeri (ATCC 29473), Carnobacterium piscicola (ATCC 35586) and Lactococcus garvieae (NCIMB 702927) for a contact time of 30 min and temperature of 4 degrees C. Interfering substance was used as described for dirty conditions in the standard (10 g l(-1) yeast extract plus 10 g l(-1) bovine serum albumin solution). The substituted organisms could be stored and readily resuscitated. They were not adversely affected by the assay conditions (except exposure to the disinfectant) and could be readily prepared as suspensions. Four example products, coded A-D, were tested using both methods (including a peroxygen system, a product containing a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid, an acidic iodophore and a Chloramine T containing product). The neutralisation-dilution method, preferred in the standard, was appropriate for all products. Although there was greater test-to-test variation at the higher end of effective dilutions, repeat testing gave reliable results for four products as bactericides. L garvieae and C. piscicola were the most resistant bacterial pathogens tested, requiring concentrations between 0.1-0.5% of the four products tested to achieve 5 log(10) inactivation. For evaluating virucidal activity, BS EN 14675:2006 was modified to use infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), Spjarup serotype, using the same products with testing conditions as for BS EN1656:2000. The acidic iodophore-containing product (C) gave rise to cell cytotoxicity problems with the recommended neutralisation dilution method for titration of remaining viral activity. The other three products were reliably tested for virucidal activity using the modified assay. A further assay modification for virus mixed with Product C involved membrane dialysis for 48 h following test exposure and neutralisation by dilution. This reduced cell cytotoxicity enough to allow titration of the remaining viable IPNV. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "label": 0}

We applied electrolyzed water (EW) directly to multi-strain cocktails of Listeria monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, and Salmonella sp. at 250 ppm free available chlorine (FAC) and achieved greater than 6-log reductions in 2 min. Lower EW values were examined as antimicrobial interventions for fresh meat (beef carcasses), processed meats (frankfurters), and food contact surfaces (slicing blades). Little or no reduction relative to controls was observed when generic E. coli-inoculated beef carcasses or L. monocytogenes-inoculated frankfurters were showered with EW. Spray application of EW (25 and 250-ppm FAC) onto L. monocytogenes-inoculated slicing blades showed that greater reductions were obtained with 'clean' (3.6 and 5.7-log reduction) vs. 'dirty' (0.6 and 3.3-log reduction) slicing blades, respectively. Trials with L. monocytogenes-inoculated protein-EW solutions demonstrated that protein content as low as 0.1% is capable of eliminating FAC, reducing antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes.

This study evaluated the susceptibility of planktonic and biofilm cells of Staphylococcus spp. (n = 87), Klebsiella spp. (n = 30), and Escherichia coli (n = 74) isolates originating from food contact surfaces of milk and meat processing plants to benzalkonium chloride (BAC), sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), chloramine B (CAB), and peracetic acid (PAA). Bacterial growth and reduction of viable cells in the presence of disinfectants were determined in tryptone soya broth (TSB) and water, respectively. Biofilm positive isolates (n = 73) were tested for the presence of selected qac genes. Unlike BAC, chlorine-based disinfectants and PAA were poorly efficient in TSB, especially in the case of biofilms. However, when tested in water, the efficacy of NaClO, CAB and PAA substantially increased, which was particularly evident in biofilms. In water, staphylococcal biofilms were even more susceptible to CAB than planktonic cells. A part (23.3%) of the biofilm positive staphylococci carried the qac genes but did not express an increased resistance to BAC.

Currently, NTM are recognized as etiological agents of several respiratory and extra-respiratory infections of immune-competent individuals. The environmental nature of NTM together with the ability to assemble biofilms on different surfaces plays a key role on their pathogenesis. In the present work the ability of three fast-growing NTM (Mycobacterium smegmatis, Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium chelonae) to persist within a model of human alveolar macrophages was evaluated. Most often human infections with NTM occur by contact with the environment. Biofilms can work as environmental reservoirs. For this reason, it was decided to evaluate the ability of NTM to assemble biofilms on different surfaces. Scanning electron microscopy was used to elucidate the biofilm structure. The ability to assemble biofilms was connected with the ability to spread on solid media known as sliding. Biofilm assembly and intracellular persistence seems to be ruled by different mechanisms.", "label": 0}

Because of the parasite's extreme chlorine tolerance, transmission can occur even in well-maintained treated recreational water venues (e.g. pools) and a focal cryptosporidiosis outbreak can evolve into a community-wide outbreak associated with multiple recreational water venues and settings (e.g. childcare facilities). In August 2004 in Auglaize County, Ohio, multiple cryptosporidiosis cases were identified and anecdotally linked to pool A. Within 5 days of the first case being reported, pool A was hyperchlorinated to achieve 99.9% Cryptosporidium inactivition. A case-control study was launched to epidemiologically ascertain the outbreak source 11 days later. A total of 150 confirmed and probable cases were identified; the temporal distribution of illness onset was peaked, indicating a point-source exposure. Cryptosporidiosis was significantly associated with swimming in pool A (matched odds ratio 121.7, 95% confidence interval 27.4-infinity) but not with another venue or setting. The findings of this investigation suggest that proactive implementation of control measures, when increased Cryptosporidium transmission is detected but before an outbreak source is epidemiologically ascertained, might prevent a focal cryptosporidiosis outbreak from evolving into a community-wide outbreak.", "label": 1}
{"id": "6998", "title": "The effect of UV pre-treatment on biofouling of BWRO membranes: A field study", "abstract": "The use of biocides, particularly chlorine, in reverse osmosis (RO) desalination is widely practiced despite documented evidence that although biocides may be advantageous in controlling microbial counts in the water, in some cases they can actually exacerbate biofouling of the membranes. The adverse effects, associated with widespread biocide use, have spurred the need for finding alternative RO pre-treatment disinfection methods. Ultraviolet (UV) disinfection, and specifically medium pressure ultraviolet (MP-UV) disinfection has been considered a possible alternative and is now gaining recognition as a viable disinfection method applicable to RO desalination; however documentation on the effects of UV pre-treatment on RO membrane biofouling is scarce. This paper reports the findings from a four month field study conducted at a brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO) desalination plant, treating groundwater, in the north of Israel, in which MP-UV was applied as a pre-treatment disinfection step prior to RO desalination. The plant contains two double stage desalination trains that operate in parallel - one train served as a reference, while in the other an Atlantium HOD (TM) MP-UV system was installed. Both trains were run in parallel, and for the duration of the study, all normalized performance parameters were collected and microbial counts monitored. At the end of the run previously replaced sacrificial membranes, situated in the front of the first stages, were autopsied and various biofilm analyses were conducted to elucidate cell/extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) content and microbial speciation. The overall results suggest that MP-UV pre-treatment prolonged the train performance, which manifested itself in a lower relative normalized permeate flux decline vs. the train which received water without MP-UV pre-treatment (11% vs. 17%, respectively). Significantly less EPS was found on the RO membrane which received MP-UV treated water. The differences in biofilm thickness and cell density counts (cells/cm(2)) between the two membranes were notable, in favor of UV pre-treatment, yet less significant. The MP-UV pre-treatment also had a substantial effect on biofilm community composition; the RO membrane that received MP-UV disinfected water exhibited a biofilm in which the diversity was reduced by 30% and more, and did not contain certain phylogenetic groups that were detected on the RO membrane that received water without MP-UV pre-treatment. It can be concluded that pre-treatment disinfection using MP-UV may be a promising option for combating biofouling of RO membranes and prolonging operation of the trains between cleaning regimes.", "label": 0}

In our effort to develop new antiparasitic benzimidazole derivatives, we report in this paper CoMFA and CoMSIA studies with an initial set of 70 benzimidazole derivatives with trichomonicidal activity. Four CoMFA models and eight CoMSIA models were generated; ten of these models had values of r2\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.6 and q2\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.5. The best CoMFA model had r2\u00a0=\u00a00.936 and q2\u00a0=\u00a00.634, and the best CoMSIA model had r2\u00a0=\u00a00.858 and q2\u00a0=\u00a00.642. These models were generated by using two conformer selection methodologies (minimum energy conformations and 3D similarity), and three charge types (Mulliken, Gasteiger-H\u00fckel and electrostatic potential atomic charges). The putative active tautomers of 1H-benzimidazole derivatives were selected using 3D-QSAR calculations. All models were validated via an external test set with 13 molecules. The best models satisfied additional validation criteria. The contour maps generated show the most important features that a benzimidazole derivative should have for trichomonicidal activity; they also, suggest that substituents at the 2- and 6-positions are important in the generation of derivatives with strong activity.", "label": 0}

Artificially inoculated radish seeds were soaked in sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solutions (200 and 20000 ppm), rinsed in distilled water, and sprayed with water or a calcinated calcium solution during sprouting. Microbial plate count was obtained at each step of the process and germination rate was determined after 72 h of sprouting. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was done on treated seeds and sprouts to locate which parts were populated by the E. coli cells. The results showed that the active compound in the calcinated calcium was calcium oxide. The treatment of 200 ppm NaOCl soaking followed by 0.04% calcinated calcium spray resulted in no microbial growth after a 72-h sprouting, while maintaining a high germination rate. The 0.4% calcinated calcium spray significantly reduced the germination rate and is therefore not recommended. Soaking the seeds in a 20000 ppm chlorine solution achieved the highest E. coli count reduction (1.65 log CFU/g). However, the E. coli cells that survived the 20000 ppm chlorine soak grew to 6 log CFU/g sprouts after a 72-h sprouting, significantly higher than the initial count on the seeds. The SEM microimages showed that the bacteria were mostly located in the roots of the radish sprouts and all across the seed surface. The E. coli O157:H7 87-23 cells appeared to be located in biofilms or embedded into the radish sprout tissues during sprouting. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The seed sanitation treatment with 20000 ppm chlorine solution that is currently used by the sprout industry was once again found to be ineffective in eliminating inoculated pathogenic cells. More importantly, the remaining cells that have survived the chlorine wash would grow during sprouting to reach an alarmingly high cell concentration. The new observation of E. coli cells and sprout tissue interaction manifested as embedding of the cells in sprout tissues, if confirmed, will have a significant impact on the microbial safety intervention strategies used in the sprout industry. This research demonstrated the importance of eliminating all pathogens on the seeds before germination and sprouting.", "label": 1}

Maximum active chlorine concentration of 0.75 mg/l was obtained at an optimum current density of 1.5 mA/cm(2) from an available chloride concentration of 8.5 mg/l found naturally in the tap water. It was observed that with an increase in the current density, there was a marked decrease of chloride conversion from 50 to 42%. The maximum chloride conversion rate of 57.3% was achieved corresponding to an electrolysis time of 30 min. There was no marked change in pH after the electrolysis which may be attributed to the neutralization of hydroxyl ions generated at the cathode with the protons spitted at the anode.

Dysregulated Wnt activity is one of the major underlying mechanisms responsible for many diseases including cancer. We previously reported the FDA-approved anthelmintic drug Niclosamide inhibits Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and suppresses colon cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Niclosamide is a multi-functional drug that possesses important biological activity in addition to inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Here, we studied the SAR of Wnt signaling inhibition in the anilide and salicylamide region of Niclosamide. We found that the 4'-nitro substituent can be effectively replaced by trifluoromethyl or chlorine and that the potency of inhibition was dependent on the substitution pattern in the anilide ring. Non-anilide, N-methyl amides and reverse amide derivatives lost significant potency, while acylated salicylamide derivatives inhibited signaling with potency similar to non-acyl derivatives. Niclosamide's low systemic exposure when dosed orally may hinder its use to treat systemic disease. To overcome this limitation we identified an acyl derivative of Niclosamide, DK-520 (compound 32), that significantly increased both the plasma concentration and the duration of exposure of Niclosamide when dosed orally. The studies herein provide a medicinal chemical foundation to improve the pharmacokinetic exposure of Niclosamide and Wnt-signaling inhibitors based on the Niclosamide chemotype. The identification of novel derivatives of Niclosamide that metabolize to Niclosamide and increase its drug exposure may provide important research tools for in vivo studies and provide drug candidates for treating cancers with dysregulated Wnt signaling including drug-resistant cancers. Moreover, since Niclosamide is a multi-functional drug, new research tools such as DK520 could directly result in novel treatments against bacterial and viral infection, lupus, and metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes, NASH and NAFLD.", "label": 0}

The fact that it is amenable to chemical modification makes GA an attractive molecule for the development of anticancer agents. We firstly reported the synthesis of gambogellic acid, which was generated under acid catalysis from readily available GA by a base-catalyzed diene intramolecular annelation. Sequentially, thirteen new compounds were synthesized and their inhibitory activity on HT-29, Bel-7402, BGC-823, and A549 cell lines were evaluated in vitro by MTT assay, and (38, 40)-epoxy-33-chlorogambogellic acid (4) was identified as a BGC-823 cell apoptosis inducer through MTT cell assay, observations of morphological changes, and Annexin-V/PI double-staining assay. Compound 4 showed significant effects in inducing apoptosis and might serve as a potential lead compound for discovery of new anticancer drugs. Further structure\u2013activity relationships (SARs) of gambogic acid derivatives were discussed.", "label": 0}

Old cast iron main pipes were removed from water distribution networks in France, England, Portugal, and Latvia, and E. coli was analyzed in the biofilm. In addition, 44 flat coupons made of cast iron, polyvinyl chloride, or stainless steel were placed into and continuously exposed to water on 15 locations of 6 distribution networks in France and Latvia and examined after 1 to 6 months exposure to the drinking water. In order to increase the signal intensity, a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) 15-mer probe was used in the FISH screening for the presence or absence of E. coli on the surface of pipes and coupons, thus reducing occasional problems of autofluorescence and low fluorescence of the labeled bacteria. For comparison, cells were removed from the surfaces and examined with culture-based or enzymatic (detection of beta-d-glucuronidase) methods. An additional verification was made by using PCR. Culture method indicated presence of E. coli in one of five pipes, whereas all pipes were positive with the FISH methods. E. coli was detected in 56% of the coupons using PNA FISH, but no E. coli was detected using culture or enzymatic methods. PCR analyses confirmed the presence of E. coli in samples that were negative according to culture-based and enzymatic methods. The viability of E. coli cells in the samples was demonstrated by the cell elongation after resuscitation in low-nutrient medium supplemented with pipemidic acid, suggesting that the cells were present in an active but nonculturable state, unable to grow on agar media. E. coli contributed to ca. 0.001 to 0.1% of the total bacterial number in the samples. The presence and number of E. coli did not correlate with any of physical and/or chemical characteristic of the drinking water (e.g., temperature, chlorine, or biodegradable organic matter concentration). We show here that E. coli is present in the biofilms of drinking water networks in Europe. Some of the cells are metabolically active but are often not detected due to limitations of traditionally used culture-based methods, indicating that biofilm should be considered as a reservoir that must be investigated further in order to evaluate the risk for human health.", "label": 1}

Although the human-derived system gave primarily one product, similar metabolites were noted from each system. Enantiomers of the major metabolic product, in both cases the trans-2,3-dihydrodiol, were separated by chiral stationary-phase chromatography. Absolute configurations were assigned by application of the benzoate exciton chirality rules to the CD spectra of the 4-(dimethylamino)benzoyl esters. Liver microsomes from Aroclor 1254-treated rats produced the R,R enantiomer of the diol in 75-78% enantiomeric excess, while human liver microsomes produced this enantiomer in only 6-12% excess. The activities of these enantiomers were compared in Salmonella typhimurium strain TM677 mutagenicity assays employing the 9000g supernatant of Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver homogenates. Both the syn- and anti-2,3-dihydrodiol 1,10b-epoxides, which had only been inferred to be metabolites in previous studies, were isolated from the microsomal incubations by preparative reverse-phase HPLC. The evident exceptional aqueous stabilities of these diol epoxides were further examined by half-life determination experiments.

Here we synthesize the available scientific evidence to derive probability distributions and mathematical models of bacterial transfers between environmental surfaces and foods, including those during slicing of food, and of bacterial removal during cleaning and sanitizing (models available at  | www.foodrisk.org | ). Transfer coefficients varied considerably by surface type, and after log10 transformation were best described by normal distributions with means ranging from ? 0.29 to ? 4.96 and standard deviations that ranged from 0.07 to 1.39. \u2018Transfer coefficients\u2019 during slicing were best described by a truncated logistic distribution with location 0.07 and scale 0.03. In the absence of protein residues, mean log inactivation indicated a greater than 5 log10 reduction for sanitization with hypochlorite (mean: 6.5 log10; 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.0\u20138.1 log10) and quaternary ammonium compounds (mean: 5.5 log10; 95% CI: 3.6\u20137.3 log10), but in the presence of protein residues efficacy reduced dramatically for hypochlorite (mean: 3.8 log10; 95% CI: 2.1\u20135.4 log10) as well as quaternary ammonium compounds (mean: 4.4log10; 95% CI: 2.5\u20136.4 log10). Overall, transfer coefficients are therefore low, even though cross-contamination can be extremely efficient under certain conditions. Dozens of food items may consequently be contaminated from a single contaminated slicer blade, albeit at low concentrations. Correctly performed sanitizing efficiently reduces L. monocytogenes contamination in the environment and therefore limits cross-contamination, even though sanitization is only performed a few times per day. However, under unfavorable conditions reductions in bacterial concentration may be far below 5 log10. The probability distributions and mathematical models derived here can be used to evaluate L. monocytogenes cross-contamination dynamics in environments where foods are handled, and to assess the potential impact of different intervention strategies.", "label": 1}

Millions of patients with hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are currently treated with INF-alfa-2a daily. Only 5 cases of anosmia have been reported in the literature, and none was associated with pegylated INF-alfa. Case summary: A 55-year-old Arab male (height, 5?1?; weight, 81 kg) with chronic HCV developed anosmia and ageusia (loss of the sense of taste) after 36 weeks of treatment for HCV with subcutaneous pegylated INF-alfa-2a 180 ?g and ribavirin 1200 mg. Treatment was continued for 12 additional weeks before being discontinued. Twenty-four weeks after treatment was discontinued, HCV-RNA was undetectable and, during the same visit, the patient reported that he had regained his sense of smell a few weeks previously. The Naranjo algorithm score was 7, representing a probable association of anosmia with INF-alfa-2a treatment. Other etiologies for loss of smell and taste were ruled out.

Recently there has been a great increase in the use of polyethylene (PE) pipes in drinking water distribution systems in China. Some organics can leach from PE pipes into drinking water, which is undoubtedly harmful for consumers. In this study, potential organics leaching from two Chinese brands of PE pipe were investigated in order to determine the potential risk to both consumers and water quality. Their released amounts are characterized by UV254 instead of total organic carbon (TOC). Organics are identified by means of gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Influencing factors such as types of water, time, pH, residual chlorine are discussed. The cytotoxicity of leaching organics is first put forward in this study, and rat C6 glioma cell is used to assess the effect of leaching organics; the increasing dosage of soaking solution negatively affects morphology and relative viability of rat C6 glioma cell. The results show that residual chlorine, time and temperature have a positive effect on organics release, while pH plays an opposite role.", "label": 0}

The disinfected environments included water sampled from four full-scale distribution systems. Microorganisms from non-disinfected environments included bacterial isolates from raw water (from the same four participating utilities), pure culture strains of heterotrophic bacteria and E. coli O157:H7 from ATCC, and six environmental strains of E. coli O157:H7 isolated by the Wisconsin Food Research Institute from cow manure and farm wastewater. Microbial sources from disinfected environments included isolated heterotrophic bacteria from distributed municipal water from 4 different locations across North America. The inactivation kinetics expts. were conducted at bench-scale at 21\u00b0C. The disinfectants tested included free chlorine and monochloramine. With monochloramine, all strains of E. coli O157:H7 tested showed approx. 2 to 3 log10 of inactivation with Ct values ranging from 20-30 mg.min/L. The Ct values for 2-3 log10 of inactivation of E. coli O157:H7 using chlorine were less than 0.30 mg.min/L. All environmental strains of E. coli O157:H7 were consistently more resistant to monochloramine than the ATCC 35150 strain and these differences were statistically significant. Several strains of heterotrophic bacteria were isolated from distributed water collected from the 4 participating utilities. These isolates were identified using API biochem. profiling and included various types of pseudomonads (P. fluorescens) and pseumonad-related bacteria such Brevundimonas vesicularis and Sphingomonas paucimobilis. Inactivation kinetics expts. of these isolates as well as the kinetics of culture collection strains show that there was a wide range of resistance amongst heterotrophic bacteria. If evidence is generated in support of the hypothesis that disinfectant-tolerant microorganism can evolve in distribution systems, it could potentially lead to a reassessment of the practice of maintaining a steady concn. of secondary disinfectant. Strategies such as periodic changes in disinfectant concn. or type may, potentially be considered. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}

In this work, an integrative approach is implemented to determine the drug stability both in the solid state and aqueous solutions, identify the impurities that can be found in the active pharmaceutical ingredient, and evaluate the associated toxicity risks. Thermal analyses pointed out a two?step dehydration of the solid state. This phenomenon seems to be consistent with the organization of the water molecules in the crystal structure and results in the destruction of the lattice. Seven related compounds of quinacrine have been identified by liquid chromatography\u2013ion trap mass spectrometry. The main thermal degradant both in the solid state and the solution corresponds to the N?deethyl compound, whereas quinacrine tertiary amine oxyde appears to be a signal impurity of oxidative stress in solution. Moreover, two photolytic impurities can be formed in solution either by aromatic amine cleavage or via O?demethylation. Additionally, using computational approaches, the analysis of the potential toxicity of the impurities compared with the parent compound one shows that ketone and O?demethyl derivatives may exhibit specific toxicity profiles. \u00a9 2011 Wiley?Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 100:3223\u20133232, 2011", "label": 0}
{"id": "2535", "title": "Emerging investigators series: the efficacy of chlorine photolysis as an advanced oxidation process for drinking water treatment", "abstract": "The photolysis of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypochlorite (OCl-) produces a suite of reactive oxidants, including hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot), chlorine radical (Cl.), and ozone (O-3). Therefore, the addition of light to chlorine disinfection units could effectively convert existing drinking water treatment systems into advanced oxidation processes. This review critically examines existing studies on chlorine photolysis as a water treatment process. After describing the fundamental chemistry of chlorine photolysis, we evaluate the ability of chlorine photolysis to transform model probe compounds, target organic contaminants, and chlorine-resistant microorganisms. The efficacy of chlorine photolysis to produce reactive oxidants is dependent on solution and irradiation conditions (e.g., pH and irradiation wavelengths). For example, lower pH values result in higher steady-state concentrations of. OH and Cl., resulting in enhanced contaminant removal. We also present the current state of knowledge on the alteration of dissolved organic matter and subsequent formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) during chlorine photolysis. Although the relative yields of DBPs during chlorine photolysis are also dependent on solution conditions (e.g., higher organic DBP yields at low pH values), there is conflicting evidence on whether chlorine photolysis increases or decreases DBP production compared to thermal reactions between chlorine and dissolved organic matter in the dark. We conclude the review by identifying knowledge gaps in the current body of literature.", "label": 1}

The dihydroxylated coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxy-coumarin and esculetin, induced DNA fragmentation as well as characteristic morphological changes of programmed cell death in U-937 cells. With the aim to perform a structure-activity relationship study, the correlation between the physicochemical properties of the molecules and their pro-apoptotic activity was carried out. Results showed that the presence of two adjacent phenolic hydroxyl groups was the most important factor in terms of the SAR. The exposure of leukemic cells to 7,8-dihydroxy-coumarin evoked a phenoxyl radical generation that was detected by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The present study suggests that reactive oxygen species generation plays a critical role in dihydroxycoumarin-induced apoptosis in U-937 cells. These findings further suggest that these compounds may have a potential therapeutic role in the treatment of hematological malignancies.", "label": 0}

Due to the occasional failure of the monsoons, a drinking water problem in these areas becomes quite acute. Water has to be brought in tankers and railway wagons to meet the drinking water needs of the people. With the advent of desalination technology based on both thermal and membrane processes, it is being considered as an alternate source to provide/augment the drinking water sources in the coastal water scarce areas. R & D work carried out at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) on desalination in the last 10-15 y has resulted in the development of technology for brackish water and seawater desalination in the country. Operation of pilot plants based on both membrane and thermal desalination has provided useful data for the design of large-scale desalination plants. This paper gives the details of a 1.4 mgd (6300 m(3)/d) desalination plant to be installed in a coastal area for augmenting the drinking water supply. This consists of a 1.0 mgd multi-stage flash (MSF) and a 0.4 mgd two-stage reverse osmosis (RO) plant based on an indigenously available cellulosic membrane. A two-stage RO process is required in view of moderate salt rejection of cellulose acetate membranes for seawater feed. These membranes, however, possess better chlorine tolerance and fouling resistance compared to TFC membranes. As such this system is more appropriate under Indian conditions. The steam for the MSF plant will be available from a thermal power station where the plant is to be set up. Part of the product water obtained from the MSF plant will be used for entire boiler feed make up of the power station (in lieu of obtaining steam and power for the desalination plant). The remaining product water from the MSF plant (around 0.6 mgd) and RO plant (0.4 mgd) will be blended to get potable water of 250 ppm TDS. The MSF and RO plants are based on indigenous technology using most of the materials and equipment made locally. The detail design aspects and the cost estimates are presented in the paper.", "label": 0}
{"id": "8924", "title": "Antagonism between Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas fluorescens in planktonic systems and in biofilms", "abstract": "In the environment, many microorganisms coexist in communities competing for resources, and they are often associated as biofilms. The investigation of bacterial ecology and interactions may help to improve understanding of the ability of biofilms to persist. In this study, the behaviour of Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas fluorescens in the planktonic and sessile states was compared. Planktonic tests were performed with single and dual species cultures in growth medium with and without supplemental FeCl3. B. cereus and P. fluorescens single cultures had equivalent growth behaviours. Also, when in co-culture under Fe-supplemented conditions, the bacteria coexisted and showed similar growth profiles. Under Fe limitation, 8 h after co-culture and over time, the number of viable B. cereus cells decreased compared with P. fluorescens. Spores were detected during the course of the experiment, but were not correlated with the decrease in the number of viable cells. This growth inhibitory effect was correlated with the release of metabolite molecules by P. fluorescens through Fe-dependent mechanisms. Biofilm studies were carried out with single and dual species using a continuous flow bioreactor rotating system with stainless steel ( SS) substrata. Steady-state biofilms were exposed to a series of increasing shear stress forces. Analysis of the removal of dual species biofilms revealed that the outer layer was colonised mainly by B. cereus. This bacterium was able to grow in the outermost layers of the biofilm due to the inhibitory effect of P. fluorescens being decreased by the exposure of the cells to fresh culture medium. B. cereus also constituted the surface primary coloniser due to its favourable adhesion to SS. P. fluorescens was the main coloniser of the middle layers of the biofilm. Single and dual species biofilm removal data also revealed that B. cereus biofilms had the highest physical stability, followed by P. fluorescens biofilms. This study highlights the inadequacy of planktonic systems to mimic the behaviour of bacteria in biofilms and shows how the culturing system affects the action of antagonist metabolite molecules because dilution and consequent loss of activity occurred in continuously operating systems. Furthermore, the data demonstrate the biocontrol potential of P. fluorescens on the planktonic growth of B. cereus and the ability of the two species to coexist in a stratified biofilm structure.", "label": 0}

The pH was dramatically decreased from 7 to similar to 3 within 60 min, accompanying with a 6-log reduction. To evaluate the contribution of pH on inactivation, a set of experiments were designed and tested. Results indicate that the contribution of low pH to the inactivation could be neglected compared to that of electrical discharges. On the other hand, the decrease of pH could be eased as carbonate or phosphate buffer was added to the treated water. However, the inactivation efficiency was greatly reduced because the buffers could deplete the active species formed in electrical discharges. Besides, a new finding is addressed in this paper that the water after plasma treatment still owns a certain extent of inactivation ability, functioning like the free chlorine residual.

We review the large body of literature on soft lens deposition to define the link between deposits and symptoms. Our critique attempts to clarify areas of doubt in previous methodologies for analyzing deposits, and to focus on the aspects of deposition as relevant to inducing ocular responses. The principal features confounding previous experimentation are: variables in experimental design; methodological flaws, such as imperfect extraction of material from a lens; focus on determining the quantity of a component at the expense of considering its nature and biological activity; reporting of results from nonrepresentative wearing conditions and lenses. Despite the introduction of disposable lenses, lens surface build-up remains an important factor in determining lens-wear success. The composition of deposits has been the target of many studies that show that lysozyme is the principal soilant on the lens surface. Estimates of protein quantities found on lenses are subject to the extraction technique but provide the common finding that Group IV lenses attract the greatest level of deposit. Nonionic lens surfaces have a greater affinity for lipids. The extent to which other species such as carbohydrates and minerals, contribute to lens deposits is less well defined. There are some clues to the structural basis for deposit formation, but further research is necessary to isolate the key events leading to deposits. The sheer weight of energy that has been invested into examining lens coatings suggests that surface build-up plays a role in contact lens complications, although proof linking a specific component with a specific biocompatibility issue remains lacking. Emphasis should be placed on determining the nature, as well as quantity, of lens deposit components and on the development of clinical methods that can link symptomatology with derived deposit patterns.", "label": 0}

However, the control of biofilm is a bottleneck in the application of this technology. To resolve the problem of biofilm formation and development, antimicrobial characteristics of chlorine dioxide and benzyldimethyldodecyl-ammonium chloride on biofilm at different substrate levels were investigated. Biofilm detachment ratio and TTC-dehydrogenase activity (DHA) were two indexes to discuss the antimicrobial effects. The results showed that at the high substrate level, the biofilms characteristics (biomass, the content of protein, polysaccharide and EPS) were the higher than those at the medium and low substrate levels, however biofilm's DHA at the medium substrate level (12.97 mu gTF/(g h)) was higher than those at the medium substrate level (7.64 mu gTF/(g h)) and low substrate level (1.94 mu gTF/(g h).

The results indicate that the compounds containing the electron-withdrawing substituents in the para position of the substitute ring exerted more potent analgesic activity in mice, being much more potent than the prototype N-antipyrine-3,4-dichloromaleimide and some reference drugs. Some compounds exhibited activity against human opportunistic and pathogenic fungi, with MIC values of between 40 and 100\u00a0?g/mL (91.74 and 236.96\u00a0?M), and it was verified that only a few compounds presented potential for cytotoxic activity.", "label": 0}
{"id": "9157", "title": "Efficacy of decontaminants and disinfectants against Clostridium difficile", "abstract": "Clostridium difficile is a common nosocomial pathogen transmitted mainly via its spores. These spores can remain viable on contaminated surfaces for several months and are resistant to most commonly used cleaning agents. Thus, effective decontamination of the environment is essential in preventing the transmission of C. difficile in health-care establishments. However, this emphasis on decontamination must also be extended to laboratories due to risk of exposure of staff to potentially virulent strains. Though few cases of laboratory-acquired infection have been reported, the threat of infection by C. difficile in the laboratory is real. Our aim was to test the efficacy of four disinfectants, Actichlor, MicroSol 3+, TriGene Advance and Virkon, and one laboratory decontaminant, Decon 90, against vegetative cells and spores of C. difficile. Five strains were selected for the study: the three most commonly encountered epidemic strains in Scotland, PCR ribotypes 106, 001 and 027, and control strains 630 and VPI 10463. MICs were determined by agar dilution and broth microdilution. All the agents tested inhibited the growth of vegetative cells of the selected strains at concentrations below the recommended working concentrations. Additionally, their effect on spores was determined by exposing the spores of these strains to different concentrations of the agents for different periods of time. For some of the agents, an exposure of 10 min was required for sporicidal activity. Further, only Actichlor was able to bring about a 3 log(10) reduction in spore numbers under clean and dirty conditions. It was also the only agent that decontaminated different hard, non-porous surfaces artificially contaminated with C. difficile spores. However, this too required an exposure time of more than 2 min and up to 10 min. In conclusion, only the chlorine-releasing agent Actichlor was found to be suitable for the elimination of C. difficile spores from the environment, making it the agent of choice for the decontamination of laboratory surfaces.", "label": 0}

All individuals who died in New Mexico and fell under medical examiner jurisdiction between November 23, 2000, and November 22, 2002, were prospectively evaluated using sets of surveillance symptoms and autopsy-based pathologic syndromes. All infectious disease deaths were evaluated to identify the specific causative agent. Of 6104 jurisdictional cases, 250 (4.1%) met Med-X criteria, of which 141 (56.4%) had a target pathologic syndrome. Ultimately, 127 (51%) of the 250 cases were due to infections. The causative organism was identified for 103 (81%) of the infectious disease deaths, of which 60 (58.3%) were notifiable conditions in New Mexico. Flu-like symptoms, fever and respiratory symptoms, and encephalopathy or new-onset seizures had predictive values positive for fatal infections of 65%, 72%, and 50%, respectively, and are useful as autopsy performance criteria. Before the development of surveillance criteria, 37 (14.8%) of the cases ordinarily would not have been autopsied resulting in a 1% increase in autopsy workload. Med-X is an effective method of detecting infectious disease deaths among medical examiner cases. Uniform criteria for performing medical examiner autopsies and reporting cases to public health authorities enhance surveillance for notifiable infectious diseases and increase the likelihood of recognizing deaths related to bioterrorism.", "label": 0}

Background Since 1979, cefaclor has established a record of efficacy in the management of respiratory tract infections. Factors contributing to the efficacy and tolerability of this drug include its molecular stability, activity against the most prevalent gram-positive and gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens, rapid absorption, &gt; 90% bioavailability, and good penetration into respiratory mucosa. After 2 decades of widespread use, this agent remains clinically effective in patients with respiratory tract infections, making it competitive with other cephalosporins and with macrolides and fluoroquinolones, including many newer agents used for respiratory tract infections. Cefaclor extended-release tablets, the newest formulation, retain the positive efficacy and tolerability attributes of immediaterelease cefaclor, varying mainly in the rate of dissolution. The approved indications for extended-release cefaclor include bacterial bronchitis, pharyngitis, and skin infections. Methods A MEDLINE\u00ae search showed that the few adverse effects related to therapy with cefaclor are usually minor and transient and that drug-drug interactions involving cefaclor are rare. Conclusions Multiple clinical trials have shown that extended-release cefaclor in 375-mg and 500-mg doses BID demonstrates tolerability and efficacy comparable to those of immediate-release cefaclor 250 mg TID. Extended-release cefaclor is indicated for BID dosing, which should encourage greater compliance.", "label": 0}

Concentrations of DBPs (mean +/- standard deviation) in tap water were the following: total trihalomethanes (THMs) 205 +/- 70 micrograms/l, five haloacetic acids (HAAs) 150 +/- 30 micrograms/l, and 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (mutagen X or MX) 160 +/- 50 ng/l. Concentrations of THMs and HAAs exceeded the corresponding US standards by a factor of 2.5, while MX concentrations were the highest ever reported. The mutagenic activity of tap water extracts in the Salmonella TA-100 assay was 14,900 net revertants/l. Concentrations of chloroform in breathing zone air in bathrooms during showering were 330 +/- 260 micrograms/m3, shower room air at an industrial plant 2,600 +/- 1,100 micrograms/m3, and bedrooms of local residents 2 +/- 2 micrograms/m3. The mean concentration of chloroform was 3.2 micrograms/m3 in exhaled air samples collected before showering and 110 micrograms/m3 after showering. Data on water ingestion and water use practices in the general population and for pregnant women were collected using questionnaires and diaries. Due to concerns over microbiological safety of water, average daily consumption of non-boiled tap water in pregnant women was only 0.01 l/day, while consumption of boiled tap water was 0.81 l/day. This resulted in low ingestion exposures to volatile THMs. Inhalation and dermal absorption determined total exposures to these compounds. HAAs and MX persist in boiled water and drinks resulting in high ingestion exposures. Several brands of inexpensive home water filters were tested for removal of these compounds. To demonstrate a method of exposure reduction in a sensitive subpopulation, the most efficient filters were given to a group of pregnant women. These women and a control group of pregnant women without filters maintained water ingestion diaries for two weeks. The use of home filters resulted in reduction of exposures to HAAs by a factor of three and a greater reduction in exposures to MX.", "label": 0}

However, consistent quantification is a challenge due to variable environmental, paper, and lighting conditions, especially across large multi-target muPADs. Compensations must be made for variations between images to achieve reproducible results without a separate lighting enclosure. We thus developed a simple method using triple-reference point normalization and a fast-Fourier transform (FFT)-based pre-processing scheme to quantify consistent reflected light intensity signals under variable lighting and channel conditions. This technique was evaluated using various light sources, lighting angles, imaging backgrounds, and imaging heights. Further testing evaluated its handle of absorbance, quenching, and relative scattering intensity measurements from assays detecting four water contaminants - Cr(VI), total chlorine, caffeine, and E. coli K12 - at similar wavelengths using the green channel of RGB images. Between assays, this algorithm reduced error from muPAD surface inconsistencies and cross-image lighting gradients. Although the algorithm could not completely remove the anomalies arising from point shadows within channels or some non-uniform background reflections, it still afforded order-of-magnitude quantification and stable assay specificity under these conditions, offering one route toward improving smartphone quantification of muPAD assays for in-field water quality monitoring.", "label": 0}

The objective of this study was to develop a unique surface decontamination method for produce using sodium chlorite and an acid in a sequential treatment. The surfaces of cantaloupe rinds, peels of cucumbers, stem scars of grape tomatoes, and leaves of baby spinach were inoculated with Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes at 5 to 6 log CFU/g, submerged in 1.6 to 4% sodium chlorite solutions for 10 or 30 min, dried for 20 min, and then soaked in 6 mM hydrogen chloride (HCl) for 10 or 30 min and dried for 20 min. Control samples were treated with deionized water, sodium chlorite, HCl, or a premixed solution of sodium chlorite and HCl for comparison. The control treatments reduced the levels of both pathogens on the samples by only 0.3 to 2.9 log CFU/g, whereas the sequential treatment caused significantly higher reductions (P < 0.05) of 5.1 to 5.6 log CFU/g, effectively eliminating the inoculated pathogens. The more effective decontamination resulting from the sequential treatment was attributed to the in situ formation of chlorine dioxide within the plant tissues under the surface by the reaction between sodium chlorite absorbed by the produce and HCl. These results suggest that the sequential use of sodium chlorite and acid is a potentially effective treatment for elimination of foodborne pathogens on produce.", "label": 0}

These genes have been previously implicated as being essential for the biosynthesis of heme d 1, the prosthetic group of dissimilatory nitrite reductases in anaerobic, denitryfying bacteria. Tetrapyrroles detectable at steady-state levels were identified from both organisms, and cell-free extracts from each were also used to transform uroporphyrinogen in vitro. E. coli does not naturally produce d1, and the engineered strain failed to produce di or any tetrapyrrole foreign to E. coli. Therefore, while nirFDLGH may be necessary for d1 biosynthesis, it is not sufficient. In the denitrifier P. aeruginosa, the results were more positive. The presence of the plasmid led to increased levels of d1. In addition, a previously unidentified tetrapyrrole was detected. This compound was characterized by visible absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and NMR, and a tentative structure was proposed for this compound. The tetrapyrrole has structural features similar to sirohydrochlorin (as precorrin-2 or sirotetrahydrochlorin, a known intermediate of d1) and d1 itself. The most unusual substituents are epoxide and sulfoxide moieties. When this tetrapyrrole was treated with strong mineral acid and heat, it was converted into natural d1.", "label": 0}

The stations in Lake Paijanne could be grouped on the basis of meiofauna variables in approximately similar manners for both sets of samples. The connections between the meiofauna variables and environmental variables were examined for L. Paijanne, the meiofauna of the deepest zone being found to be influenced more by environmental factors than that of the upper part of the profundal zone. Oxygen saturation and phytoplankton biomass were the most important parameters in the deepest zone and total phosphorus and COD had the strongest influence in the upper profundal zone. The larger size of L. Ladoga confers a higher tolerance to environmental changes on the meiofauna, whereas the semilotic conditions in L. Paijanne seem to affect the meiofauna very easily, certain quantitative and diversity values achieving their maxima in a semi-polluted or semi-lotic environment.

The disinfectant effects of acidic electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) water against Salmonella enterica both in an aqueous system and on artificially contaminated alfalfa seeds were determined. The optimum ratio of seeds to EO water was determined in order to maximize the antimicrobial effect of EO water. Seeds were combined with EO water at ratios (wt/vol) of 1:4, 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, and 1:100, and the characteristics of EO water (pH, oxidation reduction potential [ORP], and free chlorine concentration) were determined. When the ratio of seeds to EO water was increased from 1:4 to 1:100, the pH decreased from 3.82 to 2.63, while the ORP increased from +455 to +1,073 mV. EO water (with a pH of 2.54 to 2.38 and an ORP of +1,083 to +1,092 mV) exhibited strong potential for the inactivation of S. enterica in an aqueous system (producing a reduction of at least 6.6 log CFU/ml). Treatment of artificially contaminated alfalfa seeds with EO water at a seed-to-EO water ratio of 1: 100 for 15 and 60 min significantly reduced Salmonella populations by 2.04 and 1.96 log CFU/g, respectively (P < 0.05), while a Butterfield's buffer wash decreased Salmonella populations by 0.18 and 0.23 log CFU/g, respectively. After treatment, EO water was Salmonella negative by enrichment with or without neutralization. Germination of seeds was not significantly affected (P > 0.05) by treatment for up to 60 min in electrolyzed water.

Despite vast development in Malaysia, the country experiences a myriad of water shortage issues. Therefore, Malaysia needs to carefully manage its freshwater resources to achieve sustainable development. Greywater has proven to be a useful substitute for fresh water for non-potable activities. This paper reviews examples of greywater recycling that have been successfully implemented globally, and identifies constraints of implementing greywater recyclitig systems for use in Malaysia. Greywater represents 43-70% of total domestic wastewater volume, and reusing greywater for irrigation may have adverse long-term impacts on soil. Greywater should be treated and disinfected before reuse, and can be disinfected via chlorine, UV, or ozone disinfection. Chlorine disinfection is recommended as chlorine is widely available and inexpensive. Malaysia lacks strategies for kick starting greywater recycling projects. To overcome obstacles, Malaysia could establish a moderate treated greywater quality standard (pH 6-9, TSS < 20 mg/L, <5 NTU, BOD5 < 20 mg/L and <10 CFU/100 mL of E. coli) for urban reuse and initiate greywater recycling efforts by recycling low strength greywater from ablution activities and bathrooms. Last but not least, researchers and local authorities could work closely to monitor the greywater recycling systems, while the latter could provide subsidies and rebates to financially support the implementation of the greywater recycling system and eventually achieve the goal of water sustainability.

J. Photochem. Photobiol. B 84, 2). To further explain events associated with MK-886 mediated sensitization of tumor cells toward PDT with hypericin, more detailed study of signaling pathways leading to increase in apoptosis as well as cell cycle perturbations was performed and is presented herein. Intensive accumulation of HT-29 cells in G0/G1 phase of cell cycle led to expression analyses of several G0/G1 checkpoint molecules (cyclin A, cyclin E, cdk-2, pRb). Similarly, accumulation of apoptotic cells invoked analyses of key molecules involved in apoptotic signaling (caspase-3, -8, -9; PARP; Lamin B; Mcl-1; Bax) by Western blotting and caspase activity assay. Long term survival of cells was examined by clonogenicity test. As the effect of PDT is mediated by ROS production, levels of hydrogen peroxides and superoxide anion were monitored by flow cytometric analyses. In addition, an impact of MK-886 on LTB4 production and expression of 5-LOX was monitored. Massive G0/G1 arrest in the cell cycle accompanied by increase in cyclin E level and decrease/absention of cyclin A, cdk-2 and pRb expression indicated incapability for G1/S transition. Minimal changes in cleavage of procaspases observed in cells treated with non-toxic concentrations of either agent alone or their mutual combination were not quite in line with their activity (caspase-3, -8, -9) which was significantly increased mainly in combinations. Treatment with non-toxic concentration of MK-886 had minimal influence over ROS production compared to control cells. In contrast, hypericin alone markedly increased the level of ROS, but no additional effect of MK-886 pre-treatment was detected. Further analyses of particular ROS groups unveiled an impact of increasing MK-886 concentration on superoxide accumulation accompanied with depletion of hydrogen peroxide level within the cells. The clonogenicity test revealed disruption of colony formation after mutual combination of both agents as compared to MK-886 or PDT alone. In conclusion, we presume that stimulation of apoptosis in our experimental model was accomplished preferentially through the mitochondrial pathway, although caspase-8 activation was also noticed. Interestingly, pre-treatment with MK-886 modulated distribution of ROS production in mutual combination with PDT.", "label": 0}

However, many other factors must also be considered, including effects on human health, environmental safety, and animal behavior. Aqueous solutions of sodium hypochlorite often are considered to be the 'gold standard' for surface disinfection, but these products can be corrosive, caustic, and aversive in odor. This study was designed to identify disinfectants that are as effective as hypochlorite solutions but more acceptable for use in a laboratory animal setting. An antiviral disinfectant-efficacy assay was developed by using viral vectors that expressed green fluorescence protein as surrogates for wild-type viruses of concern in laboratory animals. Efficacy testing revealed that most of the products were highly effective when used against viral vectors in suspension. However, when the disinfectants were challenged by buffering virus in protein or drying virus on nonporous surfaces, the hypochlorite and peroxymonosulfate products performed the best. Review of safety data sheets for the agents indicated that a peroxide-based product was considerably safer than the other products tested and that the pH of most products was not conducive to disposal down a drain. Behavioral testing of Swiss Webster, C57B1/6, and BALB/c mice showed that the hypochlorite- and peroxide-based products were clearly aversive, given that the mice consistently avoided these products.

Up till now there have been only limited reports dealing with the effect of decontamination on the respiration of lightly processed produce. In this paper water, sodium hypochlorite, neutral electrolysed oxidising water and peroxyacetic acid were evaluated for their effect on the respiration rate of fresh-cut vegetables such as carrot, iceberg lettuce, leek and white cabbage. Respiration rate measurements were done at 7 degrees C and 3% O-2 by means of the closed method. Following that, the influence of a packaging delay on the respiration rate of water washed and treated (80 mg/L peroxyacetic acid) carrot and white cabbage was examined. Sodium hypochlorite did not have a significant influence on the respiration rate of carrot, leek and cabbage, but increased that of iceberg lettuce from 0.30 to 0.46 mmol O-2/kg h. Washing leek and iceberg lettuce with peroxyacetic acid did not change the respiration rate, but decreased that of carrot and white cabbage to a level of less than half of its initial value. Apparently the respiration rate of fresh-cut produce with a large area of cut surfaces, was influenced by peroxyacetic acid decontamination. Grated carrots did not show any significant respiration after a treatment with 250 mg/L peroxyacetic acid. A treatment with neutral electrolysed oxidising water containing 30 mg/L free chlorine decreased the respiration of leek and white cabbage whereas with 5 mg/L it reduced the respiration of white cabbage only. During a packaging delay of 24 or 48 h a sharp increase in respiration of water washed vegetables as well as vegetables treated with peroxyacetic acid was observed. In general, besides the degree of cutting, other processing effects such as the type of sanitizer and the time between processing and packaging can have an influence on the respiration and must be taken into account when an appropriate packaging configuration needs to be designed for a specific commodity.

Of the 20 human pharmaceutical compounds selected, 16 were quantified in both the surface water and drinking water, with 22% of the values above the limit of quantification for surface water and 14% for drinking water). Psychostimulants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, iodinated contrast media and anxiolytic drugs were the main therapeutic classes of human pharmaceutical compounds detected in the surface water and drinking water. The results for surface water were close to results from previous studies in spite of differences in prescription rates of human pharmaceutical compounds in different countries. The removal rate of human pharmaceutical compounds at 11 water treatment units was also determined. Only caffeine proved to be resistant to drinking water treatment processes (with a minimum rate of 5%). Other human pharmaceutical compounds seemed to be removed more efficiently (average elimination rate of over 50%) by adsorption onto activated carbon and oxidation/disinfection with ozone or chlorine (not taking account of the disinfection by-products). These results add to the increasing evidence of the occurrence of human pharmaceutical compounds in drinking water that may represent a threat to human beings exposed to a cocktail of human pharmaceutical compounds and related metabolites and by-products in drinking water. \u00a9 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.", "label": 1}

This study presents the results of using pressurized carbon dioxide (CO2) at less than 1.0 MPa for inactivating Escherichia coli and Enterococcus sp. in artificial seawater (3.4% salinity). The bactericidal effects of pressurized CO2 were assessed using a liquid-film-forming apparatus under various conditions of pressure, temperature, and working volume ratio (WVR). Additionally, leakage of proteins and nucleic acids from cells was measured. Cell morphology of untreated cells and cells treated with pressurized CO2 was assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Pressurized CO2 treatment affected both strains; however, Enterococcus sp. exhibited higher resistance to pressurized CO2 treatment than did E. coli. Under identical treatment conditions (0.7 MPa, 20 degrees C, and 50% WVR), more than 5.0 log reduction in the load of E. coli and Enterococcus sp. was achieved after treatments for 5 min and 20 min, respectively. Release of intracellular contents occurred during the treatment process and SEM images of E. coli and Enterococcus sp. revealed that morphological changes had occurred after the treatment with pressurized CO2. Hence, pressurized CO2 has potential applications for inactivating pathogens in ballast water.", "label": 1}

From the bacteriol. point of view, Abhar Roud River is highly contaminated. Although, in the underground water is more found sulfate type near the recharge place, but there are no evaporative layers and in all probability, this change has been made as a result of discharge urban and factory sewage by absorbent wells. Necessary from the bacteriol. point of view, no pollution has been reported from the wells in Abhar plain.

Most of the sanitization treatments improved seed germination (except dry heating), reduced microbial loads on produced sprouts, and increased sprouts yield. However, only ultrasonication treatment reduced both the total aerobic counts and total coliforms counts to < 3 log (10) CFU g(-1) level on produced alfalfa, mung bean pea and radish sprouts. The sprouts produced from ultrasonication-treated alfalfa, mung bean, pea and radish seeds also outyielded their respective non-treated sprouts by 88, 25, 73 and 56%.

The modified PVC was sterilized by steam autoclaving and gamma radiation and subjected to plasticizer extraction in an extraction medium such as hexane. Virtually no plasticizer migrated out of modified PVC into the medium even after prolonged incubation for 30 d. The properties of the modified surface were evaluated by contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cell-culture studies, hemolysis assay, and whole-blood clotting time measurements. The mechanical properties of modified sheets were evaluated by measurements of tensile strength and strain at break after subjecting the specimens to different modes of sterilization. The modified PVC surface showed enhanced wettability and was found to be non-hemolytic and non-cytotoxic. Whole-blood clotting profiles of unmodified and modified PVC were virtually the same. Modification imparted slight yellow color to the material. Surface modification resulted in an 8% decrease in the ultimate stress and 28% decrease in the strain at break values. The sulfide-substituted PVC was found to be blood compatible and would be useful in applications such as tubing for transfusion, dialysis etc., where migration resistance is important.", "label": 0}
{"id": "6010", "title": "Microbial ecology of drinking water distribution systems", "abstract": "The supply of clean drinking water is a major, and relatively recent, public health milestone. Control of microbial growth in drinking water distribution systems, often achieved through the addition of disinfectants, is essential to limiting waterborne illness, particularly in immunocompromised subpopulations. Recent inquiries into the microbial ecology of distribution systems have found that pathogen resistance to chlorination is affected by microbial community diversity and interspecies relationships. Research indicates that multispecies biofilms are generally more resistant to disinfection than single-species biofilms. Other recent findings are the increased survival of the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila when present inside its protozoan host Hartmannella vermiformis and the depletion of chloramine disinfectant residuals by nitrifying bacteria, leading to increased overall microbial growth. Interactions such as these are unaccounted for in current disinfection models. An understanding of the microbial ecology of distribution systems is necessary to design innovative and effective control strategies that will ensure safe and high-quality drinking water.", "label": 1}

One novel approach, which has not been investigated to date, is to add a disinfectant to the misting water as a means of topically reducing Salmonella on pigs prior to slaughter, thereby potentially controlling this organism in the abattoir. The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate misting with water or with Virkon\u00ae S (an approved disinfectant for use in the presence of animals), for their ability to topically reduce Salmonella on high seroprevalence pig herds before stunning and to reduce Enterobacteriaceae. Three experimental groups were investigated: control group (i.e., no misting); water group (misting with cold, 15\u201317\u00a0\u00b0C, water, herein referred to as water); and a disinfectant group (misting with 0.5% Virkon\u00ae S). As pigs entered the abattoir, each animal was swabbed along its back before being allocated to its experimental group. Each group was randomly assigned to one of 3 lairage pens that were separated by non-trial pens. After 30\u00a0min of misting with water or disinfectant, pigs were moved to the stunning area, where each pig was again swabbed, as above. Swabs were analyzed for the presence of Salmonella and enumeration of Enterobacteriaceae. Before misting, Salmonella prevalence on the pigs was 79.0%, 72.1% and 83.6% for the control, water and disinfectant groups, respectively. After misting, Salmonella prevalence increased to 94.3% in the water group; whereas for the disinfectant group, the prevalence increased marginally to 85.9%. No change in Salmonella prevalence was detected for the control group. In line with the Salmonella results, no significant differences were observed in Enterobacteriaceae counts in the control group at either time point (4.37 and 5.01 log10\u00a0CFU/cm2, respectively) or in the disinfectant group before and after misting (4.02 and 4.26 log10\u00a0CFU/cm2, respectively). However, a 2.3 log10\u00a0CFU/cm2 increase in Enterobacteriaceae was recorded for the water group after misting as compared to before misting (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05). Since misting with water alone increased topical Salmonella contamination on pigs before slaughter, a risk assessment based on known Salmonella data, meat quality and welfare is recommended to determine whether its use is justifiable. On the other hand, the findings from this study suggest that misting with Virkon\u00ae S at 0.5% could have a role in topical antisepsis of pigs contaminated with Salmonella prior to slaughter and as such this warrants further investigation.", "label": 0}

This work studied colloidal interactions (adsorption kinetics and isotherms) between different oxide nanoparticles (NPs) (i.e., TiO2, NiO, ZnO, SiO2, and Al2O3) and bacteriophage, MS2. The results shows that that all oxide NPs exhibited strong adsorption capacity for MS2, except SiO2 NPs, which is supported by the extended Derjaguin and Landau, Verwey and Overbeek (EDLVO) theory. Moreover, the implication of such colloidal interactions on water disinfection is manifested by the observations that the presence of TiO2 and ZnO NPs could enhance MS2 inactivation under solar irradiation, whereas NiO and SiO2 decreased MS2 inactivation. By contrast, all of these oxide NPs were found to mitigate chlorine disinfection against MS2 to different extent, and the shielding effect was probably caused by reduced free chlorine and free MS2 in the solution due to sorption onto NPs. Clearly, there is a pressing need to further understand colloidal interactions between engineered NPs and viruses in water to better improve the current water treatment processes and to develop novel nanomaterials for water disinfection.

The application of phage in combination with CPC or LAE reduced S. Typhimurium, S. Heidelberg, and S. Enteritidis up to 5 log units in vitro at 4 degrees C. On chicken breast fillets, phage in combination with CPC or LAE resulted in significant (p<0.05) reductions of Salmonella ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 log CFU/g as compared to control up to 7 days of refrigerated storage. When phage was applied sequentially with chemical antimicrobials, all the treatments resulted in significant reductions of Salmonella. The application of chlorine (30 ppm) and PAA (400 ppm) followed by phage spray (10(9)PFU/ml) resulted in highest Salmonella reductions of 1.6-1.7 and 2.2-2.5l og CFU/cm(2), respectively. In conclusion, the surface applications of phage in combination with LAE or CPC significantly reduced Salmonella counts on chicken breast fillets.

However, little research has focused on the chemical properties of wash water. Organic input from residual soil and vegetable material deteriorates water quality and creates increasing chlorine demand within this wash water. This study evaluated the origins of chlorine demand input and chlorine decay kinetics of fresh-cut produce wash water. Using a model system, vegetable juice released per kg of processed produce for\u00a0shredded romaine lettuce, shredded iceberg lettuce, shredded carrot and baby spinach was 82.1\u00a0mL/kg, 94.5\u00a0mL/kg, 158\u00a0mL/kg, and 2.26\u00a0mL/kg, respectively. Batch water analysis revealed a rapid reaction between constituents in the wash water and chlorine where over a 90\u00a0min observation period, 50% of chlorine demand occurred within first 5\u00a0min, underscoring the challenge for any water treatment process to reduce chlorine demand once vegetables are deposited into washing systems. Moreover, the results also showed sustained chlorine demand over 90-min periods, indicating an accumulative effect on chlorine consumption with continuous organic input.

Samples were analyzed for adsorbable org. halogens (AOX), chloroform, carboxylic acids, volatile orgs., chlorite, 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2-(5H)-furanone [MX], and mutagenic activity as detected by the Ames test. Humic lake water treated with UV/Cl exhibited a higher mutagenicity level and higher MX and chloroform concns. than water treated with Cl alone. The same observation was made for mutagenicity and chloroform concn. in water pre-oxidized with low O3 doses and UV/O3, resp. When higher doses of these oxidants were used in the pretreatment step, the mutagenicity level, MX, and chloroform concns. were lower than in water chlorinated without pretreatment. The UV/O3 combination was more efficient than O3 alone in destroying precursor material to mutagenic compds. and chloroform. The higher the proportion of ClO2 in the combined Cl/ClO2 process, the lower the mutagenicity levels, MX, chloroform, and AOX concns. Inorg. chlorite prodn. increased with a higher proportion of ClO2. Aldehydes, n-alkanes, and low mol. wt. carboxylic acids were identified as byproducts following UV treatment of humic lake water. Mutagenic activity (per amt. of dissolved org.

To better understand this remarkable longevity, we investigated the bacterium's tolerance to desiccation and the effect of bacterial localization in different watermelon seed tissues on its survival. We compared the ability of A. citrulli to tolerate desiccation on filter paper discs and on host (watermelon) and nonhost (cabbage, corn and tomato) seeds to two seedborne (Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris and Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii) and one soilborne (Ralstonia solanacearum) plant-pathogenic bacteria. A. citrulli survival on dry filter paper (>12 weeks) was similar to that of X. campestris pv. campestris but longer than P. stewartii subsp. stewartii. Ralstonia solanacearum survived longer than all other bacteria tested. On all seeds tested, A. citrulli and X. campestris pv. campestris populations declined by 5 orders of magnitude after 12 weeks of incubation at 4 degrees C and 50% relative humidity, while R. solanacearum populations declined by 3 orders. P. stewartii subsp. stewartii was not recovered after 12 weeks of incubation. To determine the effect of tissue localization on bacterial survival, watermelon seeds infested with A. citrulli by flower stigma inoculation (resulting in bacterial localization in the embryo/endosperm) or by ovary pericarp inoculations (resulting in bacterial localization under the testa) were treated with peroxyacetic acid or chlorine (Cl2) gas. Following these treatments, a significantly higher reduction in BFB seed-to-seedling transmission was observed for seeds generated by ovary pericarp inoculation (>/=89.5%) than for those generated by stigma inoculation (</=76.5%) (P<0.05). Additionally, higher populations of A. citrulli survived when the bacteria were localized to the embryo/endosperm versus the seed coat, suggesting that tissue localization is important for bacterial survival in seed. This observation was confirmed when P. stewartii subsp. stewartii survived significantly longer in stigma-inoculated (embryo/endosperm-localized) watermelon seeds than in vacuum-infiltrated (testa-localized) seeds. Based on these results we conclude that A. citrulli cells are not intrinsically tolerant to desiccation and that localization of the bacterium to testa tissues does not enhance A. citrulli survival. In contrast, it is likely that embryo/endosperm localization enhances the survival of A. citrulli and other bacteria in seeds.", "label": 0}

One of the most important goals in developing green spaces is to create beautiful and pleasant scenes and consequently creating mental relaxation; turfs are the most important plants for this purpose. One factor which affects the growth of plants in arid and semi-arid regions is the salinity of the water and soil; therefore, using some types of turfgrasses which are tolerant to salinity is a key factor for culturing them more in the city landscapes in such regions. The aim of this study was to investigate the physio-morphol. and structural changes in common bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon [L.] Pers., as more tolerant species) and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L., as less tolerant species) under salt stress condition. The salt stress treatments were applied by seven concns. of NaCl + CaCl2 (1:1 proportion based on the final EC) including: 0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5 and 15.0 dS m-1. This study was conducted in a completely randomized design with factorial arrangements, each treatment with four replications. Data were analyzed and means were compared using LSD test at 5 % level. Results showed that with increasing salinity levels Kentucky bluegrass started to decrease in visual quality at 2.5 dS m-1, but bermudagrass' visual quality was still acceptable at 5.0 dS m-1. Furthermore, increasing the salinity level caused a redn. in the following indexes in both species: shoot height, shoot fresh and dry wt., root fresh and dry wt., leaf area, photosynthetic rate, total chlorophyll, and starch level. However, the reducing sugar levels and indexes of proline, and catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes had shown an increasing trend while salinity increased. However, reducing sugar levels, and catalase and superoxide dismutase activities decreased at salinity levels higher than 10 dS m-1. Structural studies showed that bermudagrass, with help of bulliform cells, could prevent water loss and tolerate the higher salinity levels. Based on these results, it can be concluded that under the no salinity condition Kentucky bluegrass has more folded leaves than common bermudagrass, however, bermudagrass is more tolerant because of thicker epidermis. Under high salinity conditions, bermudagrass kept their leaves folded, whereas the leaf structure was drastically damaged in bluegrass and no folded leaf was seen at 15 dS m-1. Further ultrastructural studies are needed to clarify more the changes occurring in leaves under salinity stress condition. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

Distinct combinations of functional properties were identified for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. 3-D Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies identified specific hydrophobic, topologic and electronic properties of the molecules for both in vitro and in vivo activities. From these results, a three-dimensional model of a DNA-quinolone complex was built using molecular modeling techniques. It was based on the intercalation of quinolone into the double helix of DNA. We conclude that the intercalation model is consistent with most available data on the structure of the quinolone complex. This predicted structure is stabilized by the binding of magnesium ion with the sp2 oxygens present in quinolone, a phosphate and a purine base of the DNA. Substituents R1 and R7 are predicted to make hydrophobic interactions in the major and minor groove of DNA, respectively. R7 Could also form hydrogen bonds with amino groups of guanines and the aspartic acid residue at position 87 in DNA gyrase subunit A.", "label": 0}

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a bacteriophage cocktail, BEC8, alone and in combination with the essential oil trans-cinnameldehyde (TC) on the viability of a mixture of EHEC O157:H7 strains applied on whole baby romaine lettuce and baby spinach leaves. The EHEC O157:H7 strains used were NalR mutants of EK27, ATCC 43895, and 472. Exponentially growing cells from tryptic soy (TS) broth cultures were spot inoculated on leaves and dried. EHEC cells were placed at low, medium, and high inoculum levels (104, 105, and 106\u00a0CFU/mL, respectively). Appropriate controls, BEC8 (approx. 106\u00a0PFU/leaf), and TC (0.5% v/v) were applied on treated leaves. The leaves were incubated at 4, 8, 23, and 37\u00a0\u00b0C in Petri dishes with moistened filter papers. EHEC survival was determined using standard plate count on nalidixic acid (50\u00a0?g/mL) Sorbitol MacConkey agar. No survivors were detected when both leaves were treated with BEC8 or TC individually at low inoculum levels after 24\u00a0h at 23 and 37\u00a0\u00b0C. When the EHEC inoculum size increased and/or incubation temperature decreased, the efficacy of BEC8 and TC decreased. However, when the two treatments were combined, no survivors were detected after 10\u00a0min at all temperatures and inoculum levels on both leafy greens. These results indicated that the BEC8/TC combination was highly effective against EHEC on both leafy greens.

Na(+) significantly decreased, and no significant decline was detected in Cl(-) content after AMF inoculation compared with the non-AM plants. The LeNHX1 gene expression was induced in the AM and non-AM plants by NaCl stress. However, AMF did not improve the LeNHX1 level, and low expression was observed in the AM tomato.

The partial reuse systems were designed to increase fish production on a limited but biosecure water resource, maintain excellent water quality, and provide more optimum swimming speeds for salmonids than those provided in traditional single-pass or serial-reuse raceways. The two systems were stocked with a total of 147,840 Atlantic salmon parr in May of 2005 (mean size 89 mm and 8.5 g/fish) and operated with 87\u201389% water reuse on a flow basis. By the time that the smolt were removed from the systems between March 28 to April 12, 2006, the salmon smolt had reached a mean size of 24 cm and 137 g and hatchery staff considered the quality of the salmon to be exceptional. Overall feed conversion was &lt;1:1. The Cornell-type dual-drain circular culture tanks were found to be self-cleaning and provided mean water rotational velocities that ranged from a low of 0.034 m/s (0.2 body length per second) near the center of the tank to a high of 39 cm/s (2.2 body length per second) near the perimeter of the tank. The fish swam at approximately the same speed as the water rotated. System water quality data were collected in mid-September when the systems were operated at near full loading, i.e., 24 kg/m3 maximum density and 52.1 and 44.1 kg/day of feed in system A and system B, respectively. During this evaluation, afternoon water temperatures, as well as dissolved oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations that exited the culture tank's sidewall drains averaged 14.8 and 15.9 \u00b0C, of 7.9 and 8.2 mg/L (O2), 4.0 and 3.2 mg/L (CO2), 0.72 and 0.67 mg/L (TAN), and 0.52 and 0.13 mg/L (TSS), respectively, in system A and system B. Dissolved O2 was fairly uniform across each culture tank. In addition, water temperature varied diurnally and seasonally in a distinct pattern that corresponded to water temperature fluctuations in the nearby river water, as planned.

Three contamination scenarios could be observed: (i) sporadic contamination in the interface of raw material reception and hygienic areas, (ii) hotspot contamination in the hygienic processing areas (iii), and widely disseminated contamination in the entirely FPE. These data demonstrate that L.\u00a0monocytogenes are common colonizers of FPEs in the European processing facilities sampled and that a consistent cross-contamination risk exists. To avoid food contamination, a risk assessment approach should assign risk levels to critical control areas (CCAs) and identify those where cross-contamination should be essentially excluded.", "label": 1}

The functionalization of the material was supported by various characterization techniques including Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and thermal analysis. About 15 percent grafting, as determined by XPS and IR spectroscopy, could be achieved under the conditions employed. The CBG sheet was applied for the first time as a potential antibacterial agent on Gram negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. The antibacterial character was quantified using the MacFarland number technique whereby the volumetric number density of colony forming units was determined. It was also quantified by a Kirby-Bauer test, where the zone formed due to mortality of bacteria caused by chlorine groups attached to the graphene was estimated by a mathematical model. Based on the zone of inhibition created, CBG was found to be more than twice as effective as unmodified graphene and graphene oxide. The synthesis promises to open up a new avenue for the development of chemically converted graphene based antimicrobial agents.", "label": 0}

The aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro and in vivo activity of glucomoringin (GMG), an uncommon member of the GLs family, and to compare it with glucoraphanin (GRA), one of the most studied GL. We have evaluated the potency of both compounds in inducing cell death, cell cycle perturbations, apoptosis, NF-kB inhibition and GST-? activity in human carcinoma cells with different GST-? contents as well as in human multiple myeloma and leukaemia cell lines. GMG-derived ITC (GMG-ITC) showed to be more effective compared to GRA-derived ITC (Sulforaphane), especially in inhibiting NF-kB activity and inducing apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway; these effects were more pronounced in myeloma cells, in which we could also observe a long lasting growth inhibitory effect, probably due to NF-kB inhibition, which is considered essential for myeloma cell survival. Both GLs were able to induce cell death in the ?M range in all tested cell lines but caused cell cycle perturbations only in myeloma cells; they were also able to modulate the GST/GSH pathway by causing a 3-fold increase in GST-? activity in MCF7 cells. In vivo study showed that pure GMG-ITC was only slightly active in a carcinoma mice model, whereas it had significant antitumoral activity in a myeloma model, causing little toxicity.", "label": 0}

These processes reduce the possibility of any pathogens entering the drinking water distribution network. However, there is doubt about the ability of these methods to remove chlorine resistant microorganisms including protozoan oocysts. Concern has also been raised about the production of disinfection by-products following the chlorination process. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysis is a possible alternative/complementary drinking water treatment method. TiO2 electrodes were prepared by the electrophoretic immobilisation of TiO2 powder (Aldrich and Degussa P25). These electrodes were tested for their photocatalytic bactericidal efficiency. E. coli K 12 was used as a model test organism. The rate of disinfection was greater for the P25 electrode compared to the Aldrich electrode under open circuit conditions, The application of an electrical bias to the working electrode increased the rate of disinfection by similar to40% for the P25 electrode and similar to80% for the Aldrich electrode. The effect of applied potential was more pronounced under conditions of high initial bacterial cell loading and high light intensities. Bacterial recovery did not occur up to 48 h after disinfection.

The aim of this research was to investigate the inactivation of B. subtilis spore and formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during sequential disinfection using a combination of chlorine dioxide and chlorine (ClO2/HOCl) or UV and chlorine (UV/HOCl) sequential disinfection. B. subtilis spores have been widely used as an indicator micro-organism for C. parvum oocysts. Trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids have been used as indicator for DBPs. This study evaluates the effect of operating parameters (e.g. chem. dose, contact time, org. matters, and pH) on the synergistic inactivation of B. subtilis spores and formation properties of DBPs. The synergistic effect of inactivation of B. subtilis spores and control of DBPs were shown when chlorine dioxide was used as the primary disinfectant and chlorine as the secondary disinfect. Almost no synergistic effect was obsd. when the UV irradn. treatment was followed by chlorine reaction. In contrast to ClO2/HOCl sequential disinfection, THMs were increased when UV was used as the primary disinfectant and chlorine as the secondary disinfect. UV/HOCl sequential disinfection increased chlorine demand about 13.6%. This result might be attributed to the change of DOM structure by UV irradn. which might affect the chlorine demand, and resulted in increase of THMs formation in the UV/HOCl sequential disinfection.

Tomatoes and lettuce leaves were spot inoculated with 100 muL of a 5 strain cocktail mixture of either pathogen and washed with 10 or 8 L of NEO water, respectively. Washing lettuce for 30 min at 65 rpm led to the greatest reductions, with 4.2 and 5.9 log CFU/g reductions achieved for E. coli O157:H7 and S.

{"id": "7402", "title": "Physics of Fresh Produce Safety: Role of Diffusion and Tissue Reaction in Sanitization of Leafy Green Vegetables with Liquid and Gaseous Ozone-Based Sanitizers", "abstract": "Produce safety has received much recent attention, with the emphasis being largely on discovery of how microbes invade produce. However, the sanitization operation deserves more attention than it has received. The ability of a sanitizer to reach the site of pathogens is a fundamental prerequisite for efficacy. This work addresses the transport processes of ozone (gaseous and liquid) sanitizer for decontamination of leafy greens. The liquid sanitizer was ineffective against Escherichia coli K-12 in situations where air bubbles may be trapped within cavities. A model was developed for diffusion of sanitizer into the interior of produce. The reaction rate of ozone with the surface of a lettuce leaf was determined experimentally and was used in a numerical simulation to evaluate ozone concentrations within the produce and to determine the time required to reach different locations. For aqueous ozone, the penetration depth was limited to several millimeters by ozone self-decomposition due to the significant time required for diffusion. In contrast, gaseous sanitizer was able to reach a depth of 100 mm in several minutes without depletion in the absence of reaction with surfaces. However, when the ozone gas reacted with the produce surface, gas concentration was significantly affected. Simulation data were validated experimentally by measuring ozone concentrations at the bottom of a cylinder made of lettuce leaf. The microbiological test confirmed the relationship between ozone transport, its self-decomposition, reaction with surrounding materials, and the degree of inactivation of E. coli K-12. Our study shows that decontamination of fresh produce, through direct contact with the sanitizer, is more feasible with gaseous than with aqueous sanitizers. Therefore, sanitization during a high-speed washing process is effective only for decontaminating the wash water.", "label": 1}

The inactivation kinetics rates were compared with those obtained with Escherichia coli O157:H7. The results show that, in pure water, the use of free chlorine produced 4 log10 of N. europaea inactivation at a CT value of 0.8 mg.min l(-1), whereas monochloramine yielded 4 log10 of inactivation at CT values of approximately 9.9-16.4mg.min l(-1). With E. coli, chlorine produced approximately 4 1og10 of inactivation at a CT of 0.13 mg.min l(-1), whereas monochloramine resulted in 4 logo10 of inactivation at a CT of approximately 9.2 mg.min l(-1). These results suggest that N. europaea is more resistant to monochloramine and chlorine than E. coli. Corrosion debris, soil material and wastewater had no statistically significant (p < 0.05) impact on the inactivation of N. europaea by either chlorine or monochloramine. It seems likely that the CT values present in distribution systems would be sufficient to control suspended cells of these two organisms, especially under conditions of breakpoint chlorination, which could be used to control nitrification. Adequate disinfection should prevent the growth of these organisms in a distribution system.", "label": 1}

Methods and Results: Two strains of M. paratuberculosis (bovine strain, NCTC 8578 and human strain Linda, ATCC 43015) were subjected to various chlorine concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mug ml(-1)) for 15 and 30 min. Chlorine test solutions were made up in two types of water, sterile water that had been deionized and subjected to reverse osmosis (DRO) and DRO water containing MgCl2, CaCl2, NaHCO3 and bovine serum albumin (0.3% w/v), the latter to mimic conditions the organism would experience in commercial water treatment operations. Conclusions: The data showed that when initial inoculum levels were high (10(6) Cfu ml(-1)) neither M. paratuberculosis strain was completely killed at the free chlorine concentrations and contact times applied. Log(10) reductions in the range 1.32-2.82 were observed.

RESULTS: NemR is a redox-regulated transcription factor which senses bleach. CONCLUSION: NemR controls expression of genes encoding electrophile detoxification enzymes, which increase bleach resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate a bleach-sensing bacterial response system and a new mechanism contributing to bacterial bleach survival. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the active component of household bleach, also functions as a powerful antimicrobial during the innate immune response. Despite its widespread use, surprisingly little is known about how cells sense or respond to HOCl. We now demonstrate that Escherichia coli NemR is a redox-regulated transcriptional repressor, which uses the oxidation status of HOCl-sensitive cysteine residues to respond to bleach and related reactive chlorine species. NemR controls bleach-mediated expression of two enzymes required for detoxification of reactive electrophiles: glyoxalase I and N-ethylmaleimide reductase. Both enzymes contribute to bacterial bleach survival. These results provide evidence that bleach resistance relies on the capacity of organisms to specifically sense reactive chlorine species and respond with the up-regulation of enzymes dedicated to detoxification of methylglyoxal and other reactive electrophiles.", "label": 0}

In fact, a study during the early phases of the cholera epidemic in Trujillo, Peru revealed that only 79% of suspected cholera cases were infected with vibrio cholera 01. Further other people contended that the government of Peru did not chlorinate many water supplies because studies by the US Environmental Protection Agency suggested that chlorine increases the cancer risk. It reacts with organic matter to make trihalomethanes. 1 study noted that this risk may explain as many as 700 cases of cancer/year in the US, yet cholera was responsible for nearly 40009 deaths in Latin America the 1st year. Besides in Trujillo, Peru the reason for not chlorinating the water supply was not due to a conscious decision to not do so on the part of the government, but because no funds had been made available to purchase chlorinators and chlorine. This is typical of many towns in developing countries. Further raw fish also played a role in transmitting cholera in Peru. Moreover the study in Trujillo indicated that water stored in containers in the home, and not the water supply, was the most important vehicle of transmission. Nevertheless chlorination of both the water supply and stored water would have prevented cholera transmission. In addition, cabbage irrigated with raw wastewater contributed to cholera transmission in Trujillo.

Observed data were analyzed using a newly developed model (Cs x T) that introduced a specific amount of chemisorbed silver onto a bacterial cell (Cs), which represented the chemisorption properties of silver on the bacterial cell body Silver cations were rapidly chemisorbed onto bacterial cells after injection into samples, and Cs values (initial concentration of silver was 0.1 mg Ag/l) were calculated as 1.810 x 10(-6) (L. pneumophila), 1.102 x 10(-6) (P. aeruginosa), and 1.638 x 10(-6) mu g Ag/cell(i) (E. coli) after incubation for 8h.

The demanded Cs x T values to accomplish a 1 log inactivation (90% reduction) of L. pneumophila, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli (the initial numbers of bacteria were 1.5 X 10(7) CFU/ml, approximately) were estimated as 2.44 x 10(-6), 0.63 x 10(-6), and 0.46 X 10(-6) mu gh/celli of silver.

Werner Arber was born in Granichen, Switzerland in 1929. Following a public school education, he entered the Swiss Polytechnical School in Zurich in 1949, working toward a diploma in natural sciences. There, his first research experience involved isolating and characterizing an isomer of chlorine. Following graduation in 1953, Arber joined a graduate program at the University of Geneva, taking on an assistanceship in electron microscopy (EM), in which he studied gene transfer in the bacterial virus (bacteriophage) lambda. Eventually encountering limitations with EM as a tool, he began using microbial genetics as a methodology for his studies. The study of microbial genetics had been possible for a relatively short time: DNA had been discovered to carry genetic information only a decade before he d entered the field. After earning his Ph.D. in 1958, Arber continued to develop skills in microbial genetics, working with colleagues in the United States for a short time before returning to Geneva at beginning of 1960. There, he continued working on lambda transduction in E. coli, but found that the virus would not efficiently propagate. Recalling research done seven years earlier by Joe Bertani and Jean Weigle on \"host-controlled restriction-modification\", he realized there must be a host-controlled modification of the invading DNA, and sought to identify the mechanism. Based on Grete Kallengerger s work that demonstrated degradation of both irradiated and non-irradiated phage lambda following injection in a host, Arber and his graduate student, Daisy Dussoix further investigated the fate of DNA, and found that restriction and modification (later determined to be postreplicative nuclotide methylation) directly affected DNA, but did not cause mutations. They also found that theses were properties of the bacterial strains, and that both viral and cellular DNA were degraded. Together, Arber and Dussoix reported their findings to scientific community in 1961 at the First International Biophysics Congress in Stockholm. Aber also presented the research to the Science Faculty of University of Geneva in 1962, earning the Plantamour-Prevost prize. Based on his work and the work of others, he hypothesized that an enzyme in the host bacterium cut DNA into smaller pieces at specific sites, and methylase modified the host DNA to protect it from the digestive enzyme. These theories were later confirmed by Urs Kuhnlein, who found that mutation of specific sites rendered the phage resistant to cleavage; Hamilton smith, who identified Type II endonuclease HindII; and Daniel Nathans, who used HindII to break the SV40 virus into 11 fragments, allowing him to determine its method of replication. Since the discovery of restriction endonucleases, researchers have used them as tools to study the functions of genes of all types of organisms. Restriction enzymes have also facilitated the study of gene functions and enabled production of substances of medical and nutritional importance. Arber feels that in the next few decades we will learn much from the study of epigentics --factors that can affect the phenotype of an organism without changing the genetic information--. He is proud that, in that studying restriction degradation and DNA methylation in the 1960s, he was among the first in studying epigenetic phenomenon.", "label": 0}

The most intense negative fragment produced by DEA to isomers I-III is the dehydrogenated molecular anion [M-H](-), mainly formed at incident electron energies around 1 eV. The vertical and adiabatic electron affinities were evaluated at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level as the anion/neutral total energy difference.

Sediments were analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by use of pressurized fluid extraction with a mixture of hexane/dichloromethane followed by HPLC with fluorescence detection analysis. Organic pollutants were also extracted with two solvents for subsequent evaluation of their genotoxicity: a hexane/dichloromethane mixture intended to select non-polar compounds such as PAHs, and 2-propanol intended to select polar contaminants. Sediment extracts were assessed by the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 + S9 mix and YG1041 \u00b1 S9 mix. Extracts were also assessed for their DNA-damaging activity and their clastogenic/aneugenic properties by the comet assay and the micronucleus test with Chinese Hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The PAH concentrations were 611 ng g?1dw, 1341 ng g?1 dw, 613 ng g?1dw and 482 ng g?1dw for VA, VC, VN and RN, respectively. Two genotoxic profiles were observed, depending on the extraction procedure. All the non-polar extracts were mutagenic for TA98 + S9 mix, and VA, VC, VN sediment samples exerted a significant DNA-damaging and clastogenic activity in the presence of S9 mix. All the polar extracts appeared mutagenic for TA98 + S9 mix and YG104 \u00b1 S9 mix, and VA, VC, VN were genotoxic and clastogenic both with and without S9 mix. These results indicate that the genotoxic and mutagenic activities mainly originated from PAHs in the non-polar extracts, while these activities came from other genotoxic contaminants, such as aromatic amines and nitroarenes, in the polar extracts.

{"id": "5925", "title": "Identification of sampling points suitable for the detection of microbial contamination in fresh-cut processing lines", "abstract": "Traditionally, microbiological testing for food safety assurance in fresh-cut industries relied on end product to evaluate compliance with microbial standards. Replacement of end-product testing by a preventive system is being recommended by competent authorities for the production of safe food. In the fresh-cut processing industry, there is still a need for the identification of suitable sampling points which facilitate the detection of a contaminated lot. The goal of this study was to gain insight on the microbial contamination throughout the processing operations involved in fresh-cut leafy green production to identify sampling points and their relation with the microbial contamination of end products. Three Spanish fresh-cut processing companies of baby spinach were visited three times. During the processing schedule, samples from product (raw material and end product), water (pre-wash water, wash water, rinse water and centrifuge water) and surfaces (workers' plastic gloves and equipment surfaces) were taken at three time intervals: at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the working day. Presence of pathogenic microorganisms such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp. and pathogenic Escherichia coli as well as the levels of generic E.\u00a0coli and coliforms were analysed in all the samples. Enterococcus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae were assessed in water and surface samples, respectively. L.\u00a0monocytogenes and pathogenic E.\u00a0coli were not found in any of the samples tested. Salmonella spp. were isolated from two centrifuge effluent water samples. Generic E.\u00a0coli was only found in centrifuge effluent water samples. To evaluate if the centrifuge water was the most suitable sampling point to detect microbial contamination of the end product, additional lab scale tests were carried out. Baby spinach inoculated with generic E.\u00a0coli confirmed the potential of centrifuge water as a control point for the detection of microbial contamination. Routine monitoring of this centrifuge water for pathogens and E.\u00a0coli as the hygiene indicator appears to be a promising tool for the evaluation of product safety.", "label": 0}
{"id": "5397", "title": "Possible associations between Salmonella persistence in poultry houses and resistance to commonly used disinfectants and a putative role of mar", "abstract": "A putative link between Salmonella persistence in the agricultural sector and resistance to disinfectants has been sparsely investigated. Therefore, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests against five disinfectants commonly used in poultry premises (formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde/benzalkonium chloride compound, oxidising compound, tar oil phenol, iodophor) were performed on 286 Salmonella isolates, including 256 from Danish broiler houses, altogether representing nine serotypes. Six of these isolates were used for adaptation and de-adaptation studies involving the five disinfectants. Amongst 60 of these isolates selected for growth studies in cyclohexane (possibly associated with up-regulated efflux), only one isolate grew. From this isolate and the six isolates used in the adaptation and de-adaptation studies, mutants highly resistant to triclosan (a disinfectant linked with mar-type resistance) were selected. In addition, adaptation and de-adaptation studies with triclosan were performed. For the 286 isolates, the small variations in MICs could not be associated with Salmonella persistence in Danish broiler houses or previous use of relevant disinfectants. Adaptation and de-adaptation did not alter MICs to the five farm disinfectants. Compared to the parent isolates, MICs for the triclosan adapted and de-adapted isolates and the triclosan mutants were significantly increased to triclosan, but not to the five disinfectants. Moreover, most of the triclosan adapted and de-adapted isolates grew in cyclohexane. Thus, there was no correlation between triclosan and cyclohexane resistance on one hand and resistance to the five disinfectants on the other, suggesting that triclosan resistance is not linked with resistance to these disinfectants.", "label": 0}

In order to increase these properties, given that the halo substitution was found to be capable of enhancing antifungal effects, we prepared a series of fluoro and chloro derivatives of 3. The microbiological evaluation carried out on newly synthesized compounds included in vitro assays for antifungal, antibacterial and antimycobacterial activities. Among the tested compounds, some dichloro and trichloro-derivatives showed interesting antimicrobial properties. In particular, compounds 10j,k,l produced inhibitory effects against pathogen representatives of yeast (C. albicans, C. neoformans) and Gram positive bacteria (S. aureus) similar or superior to those of bifonazole. In addition, their activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis was superior to that of clotrimazole and econazole, which were used as reference drugs.

We collected water samples from potable water systems of 96 buildings in Pinellas County, Florida, between January and April 2002, during a time when chlorine was the primary residual disinfectant, and from the same buildings between June and September 2002, immediately after monochloramine was introduced into the municipal water system. Samples were cultured for legionellae and amoebae using standard methods. We determined predictors of Legionella colonization of individual buildings and of individual sampling sites. During the chlorine phase, 19 (19.8%) buildings were colonized with legionellae in at least one sampling site. During the monochloramine phase, six (6.2%) buildings were colonized. In the chlorine phase, predictors of Legionella colonization included water source (source B compared to all others, adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 23) and the presence of a system with continuously circulating hot water (aOR, 9.8; 95% CI, 1.9 to 51). In the monochloramine phase, there were no predictors of individual building colonization, although we observed a trend toward greater effectiveness of monochloramine in hotels and single-family homes than in county government buildings. The presence of amoebae predicted Legionella colonization at individual sampling sites in both phases (OR ranged from 15 to 46, depending on the phase and sampling site). The routine introduction of monochloramine into a municipal drinking water system appears to have reduced colonization by Legionella spp. in buildings served by the system. Monochloramine may hold promise as community-wide intervention for the prevention of LD.", "label": 1}

In the Guidance Manual to the SWTR, the EPA recommends C\u00b7t values (product of disinfection concentration in milligrams per liter and disinfectant contact time in minutes) for different disinfectants to achieve required levels of inactivation for Giardia lamblia.

A model has been developed which can be used to approximate the C\u00b7t values that are embodied in the SWTR.

Geometrically, the electrodes were defined by their tip properties that, for standard (single-barrelled, 3.0 M KCl-filled, ? 10 M?) electrodes implied a tip opening radius of 0.135 ?m and a tip taper of 0.0215 ?m/?m in the most distal (0-150 ?m), and of 0.0105 ?m/?m in the next most distal (150-1000 ?m) tip regions. From the radiotracer studies it followed that (a) in the absence of transelectrode current passage, K+ and Cl- are leaking from the electrode tip in amounts corresponding to currents of \u00b13.8 nA, and (b) in the presence of transelectrode current passage, the flow of K+ and Cl- through the electrode tip changes with the transelectrode current in a statistically linear fashion so that K+ carries about 80% and Cl- about 20% of any electrode-injected current. From the electrical measurements it appeared that the standard electrodes are characterized by (a) a tip potential of - 2.6 mV, and (b) a resistance that changes from an instantaneous, non-rectifying type to a steady state, outwardly rectifying type, within tenths of a second of constant current flow. The outward current rectification was seen to be reduced by raising [KCl] in the immersing solution, or by lowering it in the filling solution. Together, the observed electrode properties are consistent with the electrode electrolyte's solute and solvent turnover being governed by electro-osmotic as well as by electrodiffusion laws.", "label": 0}

{"id": "6930", "title": "Drug delivery through nails: Present and future", "abstract": "Treatment of fungal infections of nails such as onychomycosis, nail psoriasis involved oral therapy with antifungals, but it caused systemic side effects such as liver toxicity and bioavailability problems due to first pass metabolism and drug interactions. Therefore topical delivery through nails also known as transungual drug delivery system came into picture. But transungual delivery had its own challenges. Nail plate is made up of cross linked keratin linkages which impart extensive bonding responsible for hardness of the nail plate. To overcome these problems mechanical and chemical approaches were studied. Chemical ones included use of penetration enhancers which weaken the integrity of nail, enhancing flux through nails. In spite of using these approaches topical permeability was limited by its barrier properties. This necessitated lookout for novel approaches which enhanced treatment efficacy and reduced treatment time. Approaches such as Iontophoresis, Ultrasound mediated drug delivery, Etching were investigated. Novel nail plate made up of human hair keratin was also investigated as an alternative model for studying flux across nail. Nail lacquers serve as most optimum carrier for antifungals. Development of newer penetration enhancers, studies on water based nail lacquers, nail varnish with antimycotic agent, are being studied extensively. Patch based delivery made up of an occlusive backing layer and a pressure sensitive adhesive matrix layer with the active agent, is also being investigated as an alternative treatment for onychomycosis. Efforts are made in inventing devices by which penetration through nail can be enhanced using a laser or by use of germicidal light for treating various skin infections. Newer technologies exhibit a lot of potential with fruitful results. Microneedles and UV light are under investigation for the scope in transungual drug delivery systems. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of current approaches and promising approaches to treat nail infections, which could widen boundaries of this system.", "label": 0}
{"id": "6487", "title": "Energetic, structural, and antimicrobial analyses of ?-lactam side chain recognition by ?-lactamases", "abstract": "Background: Penicillins and cephalosporins are among the most widely used and successful antibiotics. The emergence of resistance to these ?-lactams, most often through bacterial expression of ?-lactamases, threatens public health. To understand how ?-lactamases recognize their substrates, it would be helpful to know their binding energies. Unfortunately, these have been difficult to measure because ?-lactams form covalent adducts with ?-lactamases. This has complicated functional analyses and inhibitor design. Results: To investigate the contribution to interaction energy of the key amide (R1) side chain of ?-lactam antibiotics, eight acylglycineboronic acids that bear the side chains of characteristic penicillins and cephalosporins, as well as four other analogs, were synthesized. These transition-state analogs form reversible adducts with serine ?-lactamases. Therefore, binding energies can be calculated directly from Ki values. The Ki values measured span four orders of magnitude against the Group I ?-lactamase AmpC and three orders of magnitude against the Group II ?-lactamase TEM-1. The acylglycineboronic acids have Ki values as low as 20 nM against AmpC and as low as 390 nM against TEM-1. The inhibitors showed little activity against serine proteases, such as chymotrypsin. R1 side chains characteristic of ?-lactam inhibitors did not have better affinity for AmpC than did side chains characteristic of ?-lactam substrates. Two of the inhibitors reversed the resistance of pathogenic bacteria to ?-lactams in cell culture. Structures of two inhibitors in their complexes with AmpC were determined by X-ray crystallography to 1.90 \u00c5 and 1.75 \u00c5 resolution; these structures suggest interactions that are important to the affinity of the inhibitors. Conclusions: Acylglycineboronic acids allow us to begin to dissect interaction energies between ?-lactam side chains and ?-lactamases. Surprisingly, there is little correlation between the affinity contributed by R1 side chains and their occurrence in ?-lactam inhibitors or ?-lactam substrates of serine ?-lactamases. Nevertheless, presented in acylglycineboronic acids, these side chains can lead to inhibitors with high affinities and specificities. The structures of their complexes with AmpC give a molecular context to their affinities and may guide the design of anti-resistance compounds in this series.", "label": 0}

The ultraviolet absorption spectra were used to determine the concentrations of HOCl and OCl- in EO water and the chemical equilibrium of these species with change in pH and amperage. EO water generated at higher amperage contained a higher chlorine concentration. The maximum concentration of HOCl was observed around pH 4 where the maximum log reduction (2.3 log10 CFU/ml) of Bacillus cereus F4431/73 vegetative cells also occurred. The high correlation (r = 0.95) between HOCl concentrations and bactericidal effectiveness of EO water supports HOCl's role as the primary inactivation agent.

Little is currently known on the penetration of chemical oxidants into particles developed in wastewater treatment. In this work, a reactive transport model that incorporates intra- and extra-particle chemical decay, radial intra-particle diffusion, mass transfer resistance at particle surfaces, and non-linear reaction kinetics within a competitive multi-particle size aqueous environment, was used to analyze the penetration of ozone and chlorine into wastewater particles. Individual characteristics from two secondary wastewater treatment facilities were used in model calibration. Simulations revealed that significant ozone transport within particles greater than 6 microm required large initial concentrations to exhaust the preferential reaction with aqueous soluble matter. Chlorinated samples exhibited apparently slower reactions and thus deeper penetration (22-40 microm). Chlorine penetration was less sensitive to variations in the extra-particle reaction and disinfectant concentration than ozone. Model simulations that considered elevated initial concentrations of chemical disinfectants revealed that complete inactivation of all particle size domains was not possible with current disinfection practices (e.g., contact times). Reduction in the health risks associated with wastewater particles requires treatment that efficiently balances particle removal (filtration) and particle inactivation (disinfection).", "label": 1}

Cohorting and contact isolation, disinfective surface cleaning and hand hygiene are key elements in outbreak control. A new norovirus variant, GII.4.-2006b, spreading across many continents, caused an exceptionally long epidemic period in Finland, from November 2006 to June 2007. Here, we describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of a norovirus outbreak in a large tertiary care hospital in Finland. Altogether 240 (18%) patients and 205 (19%) healthcare workers fell ill in the 504 bedded main building of Helsinki University Central Hospital during December 2006 to May 2007. The epidemic curve had three peaks in January, February and April, and different wards were affected each time. During the outbreak, 502 patient stool specimens were tested for norovirus RNA, 181 (36%) of which were positive. Molecular analysis of 48 positive specimens revealed three main subvariants of GII.4.-2006b circulating temporally within distinct wards. Of all microbiologically confirmed cases, 121 (67%) were nosocomial and nine (5%) died within 30 days of diagnosis. Molecular analysis suggested that the three main GII.4-2006b subvariants entered the hospital with gastroenteritis patients, and the nosocomial spread within wards coincided with the epidemic peaks. Active control measures, including temporary closure of the wards, ultimately confined the single-ward outbreaks.

Acute toxicity tests were first conducted using various concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) followed by a long-term exposure to residual chlorines from a test water treated with 1 mg L(-1) NaOCl. Results showed that NaOCl was acutely toxic to both organisms. However, long-term exposure to residual chlorines from NaOCl-treated waters caused no major adverse effects to both organisms under laboratory conditions since free chlorines in the treated water was reduced to about 10% by 23-h holding and 1-h aeration. No H. barbicornis died but residual chlorine-exposed juveniles had significantly shorter body lengths at the end of exposure. Residual chlorine-exposed O. javanicus also showed no significant differences to that of the control in all measured endpoints except for hatching time. The results suggest that using 1 mg L(-1) NaOCl for disinfection of ballast waters will produce residual chlorines that is far below the LC50 and EC50 of H. barbicornis and O. javanicus even on a long-term basis.", "label": 0}
{"id": "4164", "title": "Robust evaluation of performance monitoring options for ozone disinfection in water recycling using Bayesian analysis", "abstract": "Ozonation of wastewater has gained popularity because of its effectiveness in removing colour, UV absorbance, trace organic chemicals, and pathogens. Due to the rapid reaction of ozone with organic compounds, dissolved ozone is often not measurable and therefore, the common disinfection controlling parameter, concentration integrated over contact time (CT) cannot be obtained. In such cases, alternative parameters have been shown to be useful as surrogate measures for microbial removal including change in UV254 absorbance (Delta UVA), change in total fluorescence (Delta TF), or O-3:TOC (or O-3:DOC). Although these measures have shown promise, a number of caveats remain. These include uncertainties in the associations between these measurements and microbial inactivation. Furthermore, previous use of seeded microorganisms with higher disinfection sensitivity compared to autochthonous microorganisms could lead to overestimation of appropriate log credits. In our study, secondary treated wastewater from a fullscale plant was ozonated in a bench-scale reactor using five increasing ozone doses. During the experiments, removal of four indigenous microbial indicators representing viruses, bacteria and protozoa were monitored concurrent with Delta UVA, Delta TF, O-3:DOC and PARAFAC derived components. Bayesian methods were used to fit linear regression models, and the uncertainty in the posterior predictive distributions and slopes provided a comparison between previously reported results and those reported here. Combined results indicated that all surrogate parameters were useful in predicting the removal of microorganisms, with a better fit to the models using Delta UVA, Delta TF in most cases. Average adjusted determination coefficients for fitted models were high (R-adjusted(2)>0.47). With Delta UVA, one unit decrease in LRV corresponded with a UVA mean reduction of 15-20% for coliforms, 59% for C. perfringens spores, and 11% for somatic coliphages. With Delta TF, a one unit decrease in LRV corresponded with a TF mean reduction of 18-23% for coliforms, 71% for C. perfringens spores, and 14% for somatic coliphages. Compared to previous studies also analysed, our results suggest that microbial reductions were more conservative for autochthonous than for seeded microorganisms. The findings of our study suggested that site-specific analyses should be conducted to generate models with lower uncertainty and that indigenous microorganisms are useful for the measurement of system performance even when censored observations are obtained.

Therefore, the question arises whether cells in detached aggregates can be killed with disinfectant concentrations sufficient to inactivate planktonic cells. Burkholderia cepacia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were grown in standardized laboratory reactors as single species and in coculture. Cluster size distributions in chemostats and biofilm reactor effluent were measured. Chlorine susceptibility was assessed for planktonic cultures, attached biofilm, and particles and cells detached from the biofilm. Disinfection tolerance generally increased with a higher percentage of larger cell clusters in the chemostat and detached biofilm. Samples with a lower percentage of large clusters were more easily disinfected. Thus, disinfection tolerance depended on the cluster size distribution rather than sample type for chemostat and detached biofilm. Intact biofilms were more tolerant to chlorine independent of species. Homogenization of samples led to significantly increased susceptibility in all biofilm samples as well as detached clusters for single-species B. cepacia, B. cepacia in coculture, and P. aeruginosa in coculture. The disinfection efficacy was also dependent on species composition; coculture was advantageous to the survival of both species when grown as a biofilm or as clusters detached from biofilm but, surprisingly, resulted in a lower disinfection tolerance when they were grown as a mixed planktonic culture.", "label": 1}

However, commonly used sanitizers are relatively ineffective for removing human norovirus surrogates from fresh produce. In this study, we systematically evaluated the effectiveness of surfactants on removal of a human norovirus surrogate, murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1), from fresh produce. We showed that a panel of surfactants, including sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), Triton X-100, and polysorbates, significantly enhanced the removal of viruses from fresh fruits and vegetables. While tap water alone and chlorine solution (200 ppm) gave only <1.2-log reductions in virus titer in all fresh produce, a solution containing 50 ppm of surfactant was able to achieve a 3-log reduction in virus titer in strawberries and an approximately 2-log reduction in virus titer in lettuce, cabbage, and raspberries. Moreover, a reduction of approximately 3 logs was observed in all the tested fresh produce after sanitization with a solution containing a combination of 50 ppm of each surfactant and 200 ppm of chlorine. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the combination of a surfactant with a commonly used sanitizer enhanced the efficiency in removing viruses from fresh produce by approximately 100 times. Since SDS is an FDA-approved food additive and polysorbates are recognized by the FDA as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) products, implementation of this novel sanitization strategy would be a feasible approach for efficient reduction of the virus load in fresh produce.", "label": 1}

To indicate the microbiological quality of the drinking water produced by the Alice water treatment plant (AWTP), heterotrophic plate count bacteria (HPC), Salmonella species (SP), faecal coliforms (FC) and total coliforms (TC) were determined according to standard methods. Also measured were various chemical and physical properties including pH, temperature, turbidity, residual chlorine, fluoride, phosphate, chromium, sulphate, nitrate/nitrite, copper, cadmium, zinc, total hardness and chemical oxygen demand. The chemical quality of the drinking water was acceptable with the exception of turbidity, of which values ranged between 1.6 and 4.7 NTU according to location in the distribution system. High turbidity resulted in the absence of or low residual chlorine (less than 0.3 mg/l) concentrations in the water. The failure of the AWTP to protect the distribution system with sufficient residual chlorine resulted in the microbiological quality (HPC, 2.2 x 10(3)-9.6 x 10(4) cfu/ml; SP, 0-29 cfu/100 ml; FC, 5-39 cfu/100 ml; TC, 7-209 cfu/100 ml) exceeding the standards for potable water. Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Serratia odorifera, Salmonella arizonae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia liquefaciens and Serratia marcescens were present in all water samples. There was the possibility of Vibrio species in the Victoria East Clinic water.

Should I get my well water tested to make sure it's safe for my child? Is my child going to get cancer from drinking our tap water? This article provides some of the background and a set of resources to enable the practicing pediatrician to answer these questions knowledgeably. Globally, the scourge of the effects of impure water on children's health remains enormous. Approximately 1.5 to 2.0 million children die each year from diarrheal diseases; an estimated 80% of those deaths are caused by consumption of contaminated drinking water.39 Each child in a developing country suffers an estimated five bouts of diarrheal illness per year. In certain areas, the figure is higher.75 In the United States, 20 to 35 million cases of diarrhea occur each year among the 16.5 million children aged less than 5 years, resulting in 2.1 to 3.7 million physician visits, 924,000 hospital days, and 300 to 400 deaths.50 The rate of cases caused by contaminated drinking water in the United States is unknown, but estimates for the general population range as high as 35%.47 Because of more effective water treatment, the role of contaminated drinking water in causing disease has become more subtle in developed countries. Low-level endemic spread largely goes undetected. Outbreaks often are missed as well; recognition of outbreaks requires alert clinicians to test for pathogens and report them.

Fish processing residuals present on the surface greatly reduced sanitizer effectiveness. In high org. conditions, chlorinated water was slightly more effective than ozonated water. However, ozonated water applied to fish fillets and roe was not effective for bacterial control. The presence of org. material, particularly with fillets, reduced the effectiveness of ozone.

Aim We implemented a multi-modal, hospital-wide improvement programme including a bleach-based cleaning\u2013disinfection programme (\u2018Bleach-Clean\u2019). VRE colonization, infection and environmental contamination were compared pre and post implementation. Methods The programme included a new product (sodium hypochlorite 1000\u00a0ppm\u00a0+\u00a0detergent), standardized cleaning\u2013disinfection practices, employment of cleaning supervisors, and modified protocols to rely on alcohol-based hand hygiene and sleeveless aprons instead of long-sleeved gowns and gloves. VRE was isolated using chromogenic agar and/or routine laboratory methods. Outcomes were assessed during the 6 months pre and 12\u00a0months post implementation, including proportions (per 100 patients screened) of VRE colonization in high-risk wards (HRWs: intensive care, liver transplant, renal, haematology/oncology); proportions of environmental contamination; and episodes of VRE bacteraemia throughout the entire hospital. Findings Significant reductions in newly recognized VRE colonizations (208/1948 patients screened vs 324/4035, a 24.8% reduction, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and environmental contamination (66.4% reduction, P\u00a0=\u00a00.012) were observed, but the proportion of patients colonized on admission was stable.

In this study, a bacterial gene profiling assay consisting of 14 general stress genes was used to test this hypothesis for these four compounds. Although we found a consistent induction of membrane damage, the response cascade and the extent of the response differed among the different chemical treatments. The higher chlorosubstituted anilines also triggered significantly more genes involved in other general stress MOA classes (oxidative stress and protein perturbation). These findings illustrate that, along with the commonly used physicochemistry-based MOA categorization methods, alternative tests such as the bacterial gene profiling assay can yield valuable biological information on the MOA of a certain chemical or group of chemicals that is crucial in high-quality environmental risk assessment. In a second phase, the experimental gene profiling data sets of the chlorinated anilines were analyzed and weighed against existing data on other polar and non polar narcotic compounds to obtain a broader comparison in which the predefined chemical MOAs (narcosis and polar narcosis) were contrasted with the biological MOAs (gene expression profiles). Although additional optimization of the assay is needed, our results show that the bacterial gene profiling assay opens new perspectives for biology-based chemical grouping, thereby further enabling targeted MOA-based risk assessment.", "label": 0}

Currently recommended methods for Legionella pneumophila inactivation are thermal disinfection and hyper-chlorination; however, each has significant disadvantages so that alternative disinfection approaches are needed. Monochloramine (NH2Cl) and ClO2 are potential alternatives to Cl2 which have received much attention recently. Monochloramine is considered a good secondary disinfectant due to its stability, better prevention of bacterial re-growth, superior ability to penetrate biofilm, reduced disinfection byproduct formation (DBP), and no taste and odor problems. Little is known about the efficacy of monochloramine against environmentally-grown Legionella, esp. against biofilm-assocd. Legionella. ClO2 is a strong oxidant with no taste and odor problems and minimal DBP generation; however, ClO2 use has been limited due to difficulties with safe on-site prodn. A new ClO2 generating system uses an electrochem. process which appears to be safe and easy-to-control. This study compared the efficacy of monochloramine, ClO2, and Cl2 against Legionella and heterotrophic bacteria in a model plumbing system at pH 7.0-8.0 and temp. 25-30\u00b0. Monochloramine and Cl2 were tested at single doses, 2.0 mg/L and 4.0 mg/L as Cl2, resp. ClO2 was tested at a single dose of 2.0 mg/L as ClO2 and at an initial dose of 2.0 mg/L followed by maintenance of a 0.5 mg/L residual within the system. A 99.9% inactivation (3-log redn. from initial population) of Legionella in biofilm and planktonic phases was obsd. within 0.5 h of contact for Cl2, monochloramine, and ClO2 at all tested concns. Results showed monochloramine at a single dose of 4.0 mg/L and ClO2 at initial dose of 2.0 mg/L followed by 0.5 mg/L residual maintenance resulted in >99.99% inactivation of Legionella in 0.5 h in biofilm and planktonic phases. Results suggested monochloramine at 4.0 mg/L and 2.0 mg/L ClO2 with 0.5 mg/L residual were as effective as Cl2 in eradicating Legionella in biofilm and planktonic phases.

B. cepacia, isolated from the water distribution system of the space shuttle Discovery, was grown in continuous culture to produce a bacterial contamination source for biofilm formation and removal studies. A 10(7) CFU ml-1 B. cepacia suspension, in distilled water, was used to form biofilms on 3000 micrometers2 glass surfaces.

After 18 h of formation, the B. cepacia biofilms were challenged with oxidants (ozone, chlorine, and iodine) and the rates of biofilm removal determined by image analysis. Fifty percent of the biofilm material was removed in the first hour of continous treatment with 24 mg l-1 chlorine or 2 mg l-1 ozone. Iodine (48 mg l-1) did not remove any measurable cellular material after 6 h continuous contact.

Samples of skinless carp fillets were treated with 100-fold (by weight) of electrolyzed NaCl solutions [cathodic solution, EW(?) and/or anodic solution, EW(+)] and 1% oil (0.5% carvacrol + 0.5% thymol) [1%(C + T)]. Then chemical [pH, volatile basic nitrogen, peroxide value, and thiobarbituric acid], microbiological (total viable count) and sensory analyses were used to evaluate the preservative effect of this new technology during storage at 5 and 25 \u00b0C. Our results from the chemical assays indicated that EW(?), followed by EW(+) and subsequently 1%(C + T) [EW(?)/EW(+)/1%(C + T)], significantly suppressed the lipid oxidation compared with other treatments. Data from sensory evaluation and microbiological assay showed that treatment with EW(?)/EW(+)/1%(C + T) extended the shelf-life of carp fillets to 16 and 1.3 days compared with 4 and 0.3 days for the control samples during storage at 5 and 25 \u00b0C, respectively.", "label": 1}

The results not only confirmed the requirement of genes already described for the modulation of multicellular behaviour in Salmonella typhimurium and other species, but also revealed new aspects of the biofilm formation process, such as two new genetic elements, named as bcsABZC and bcsEFG operons, required for the synthesis of an exopolysaccharide, digestible with cellulase. Non-polar mutations of bcsC and bcsE genes and complementation experiments demonstrated that both operons are responsible for cellulose biosynthesis in both S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium. Using two different growth media, ATM and LB, we showed that the biofilm produced by S. enteritidis is made of different constituents, suggesting that biofilm composition and regulation depends on environmental conditions. Bacterial adherence and invasion assays of eukaryotic cells and in vivo virulence studies of cellulose-deficient mutants indicated that, at least under our experimental conditions, the production of cellulose is not involved in the virulence of S. enteritidis. However, cellulose-deficient mutants were more sensitive to chlorine treatments, suggesting that cellulose production and biofilm formation may be an important factor for the survival of S. enteritidis on surface environments.", "label": 1}
{"id": "5729", "title": "Role of cerium in promoting the stability of CuHM catalyst against HCl to reduce NO with NH3", "abstract": "To enhance the chlorine tolerance of copper ion exchanged mordenite (CuHM) catalyst under NH3-SCR reaction condition when HCl exists in the feed gas stream, mainly from a waste incinerator, a second metal, particularly cerium, has been additionally exchanged onto the catalyst along with Cu. It prevents Cu(II) ion from being evaporated from the catalyst surface by HCl and significantly improves the catalyst deactivation. The loss of copper from CeCuHM catalyst has been observed at a reaction temperature of 450 degrees C, while that from CuHM catalyst without Ce begins at 350 degrees C. Ce simply stabilizes Cu(II) ion on the catalyst surface, generally recognized as an active reaction site for the present reaction system. X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have been employed to identify the stabilization of Cu(II) ion on CuHM catalyst by Ce. As confirmed by SR-XRD, the lattice parameters of the unit cell of CeCuHM catalyst are less altered than those of CuHM catalyst without Cc during the course of the catalyst deactivation. Similarly, as identified by XPS, Cu(II) on the surface of CeCuHM catalyst is less transformed to Cu(I) ions. Ce ions and Ce-Cl compounds formed on the catalyst surface may decrease the average electronegativity of the catalyst and increase the charge of the lattice oxygen in the zeolite framework, resulting in an enhancement of the stability of the Cu-O bond in the present catalytic system.

Its detection in environmental samples is not easy when culture methods are used, and molecular techniques such as PCR or ribosomal rRNA probe hybridization (Fluorescent in situ Hybridization, FISH) are outstanding alternatives. The aim of this work was to determine the environmental risk due to the presence of Salmonella spp. in wastewater by culture, PCR and FISH. A new specific rDNA probe for Salmonella was designed and its efficiency was compared with the rest of methods Serotype and antibiotic resistance of isolated strains were determined. Forty-five wastewater samples (collected from two secondary wastewater treatment plants) were analysed. Salmonella strains were isolated in 24 wastewater samples (53%), two of them after disinfection treatment. Twenty-three Salmonella strains exhibited resistance to one or more antimicrobial agent. Analysis of wastewater samples yielded PCR positive results for Salmonella in 28 out of the 45 wastewater samples (62%). FISH analysis allowed for the detection of Salmonella in 27 (60%) samples. By using molecular methods, Salmonella was detected in four samples after disinfection treatment. These results show the prevalence of Salmonella in reclaimed wastewater even after U.V. disinfection, what is a matter of public health concern, the high rates of resistance to antibiotics and the adequacy of molecular methods for its rapid detection. FISH method, with SA23 probe developed and assayed in this work provides a tool for detecting Salmonella in water within few hours, with a high rate of effectiveness.", "label": 0}

The detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts in water samples relies upon the use of fluorescently labelled antibodies, preferably using flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy. Here we demonstrate that four commercially available antibodies recognise a similar set of immunodominant epitopes on the oocyst wall. These epitopes appear to be carbohydrate in nature and are labile to chlorine treatment and oxidising conditions. Sodium hypochlorite and sodium meta-periodate reduced the ability of the antibodies to detect Cryptosporidium oocysts. Damage to the epitopes did not necessarily reduce the viability of oocysts. This finding may be important for the water industry, where naturally occurring oxidising conditions or sanitizing treatments could produce viable oocysts that are undetectable using standard protocols.", "label": 0}

Although Salmonella causes many foodborne disease outbreaks, there is little evidence to support cross-contamination as a major contributing factor. However, the paramount importance of preventing cross-contamination and recontamination in assuring the safety of foodstuffs is well known. Sources and factors linked to cross-contamination and recontamination of Salmonella in foods are reviewed in detail. Those foods which are not submitted to lethal treatment at the end of processing or which do not receive further treatment in the home deserves special attention. Salmonella cross-contamination and recontamination episodes have been connected to the following factors: poor sanitation practices, poor equipment design, and deficient control of ingredients. We also examine potential cross-contamination in the home. Cross-contamination and recontamination events at factory level evidence the difficulty encountered for eradicating this pathogen from the environment and facilities, highlighting the need to reinforce industry preventive control measures such as appropriate and standardized sanitation. Also, at consumer level, Public Health Authorities should install hygiene education programs in order to raise consumer awareness of the risks of cross-contamination in the home and their role in its prevention. Finally, a review on cross-contamination models of Salmonella spp. is presented.", "label": 0}

Meat from feral pigs and kangaroos is obtained from wild animals only, but much or most meat from the other game animals or birds is obtained from farmed animals. The microbiological conditions of meats from hunted animals can be compromised by poor placement of shots, the usual evisceration and sometimes further dressing of carcass in the field, and ageing of carcasses at ambient temperatures. However, the general microbiological conditions of carcasses from farmed game animals or birds slaughtered and dressed at suitable abattoirs can be comparable with or better than the microbiological conditions of carcasses from domestic animals or birds.

Orange juice inoculated with E. coli (106 CFU mL? 1) as a challenge microorganism was treated with ozone at 75\u201378 \u00b5g mL? 1 for different time periods (0\u201318 min). The efficacy of ozone for inactivation of both strains of E. coli was evaluated as a function of different juice types: model orange juice, fresh unfiltered juice, juice without pulp, and juice filtered through 500 \u00b5m or 1 mm sieves. Fast inactivation rates for total reduction of E. coli were achieved in model orange juice (60 s) and in juice with low pulp content (6 min). However, in unfiltered juice inactivation was achieved after 15\u201318 min. This indicated that juice organic matter interferes with antibacterial activity of gaseous ozone. The effect of prior acid (pH 5.0) exposure of E. coli strains on the inactivation efficacy of ozone treatment was also investigated. There was a strain effect observed, where prior acid exposure resulted in higher inactivation times in some cases by comparison with the control cells. However, the overarching influence on inactivation efficacy of ozone was related to the pulp content. Generally, the applied gaseous ozone treatment of orange juice resulted in a population reduction of 5 log cycles. Industrial relevance To facilitate the preservation of unstable nutrients many juice processors have investigated alternatives to thermal pasteurisation, including un-pasteurised short shelf life juices with high retail value. This trend has continued within the European Union. However within the US recent regulations by the FDA have required processors to achieve a 5-log reduction in the numbers of the most resistant pathogens in their finished products. Pathogenic E. coli may survive in acid environments such as fruit juices for long periods. This study demonstrates that the use of ozone as a non-thermal technology is effective for inactivation of E. coli and acid exposed E. coli in orange juice. Information on the design of the ozone treatment for inactivation of E. coli which results into safe juice products is also among the main outputs of this work.

The photo-assisted Fenton process was tested alone under different H2O2 and/or Fe(II) concentrations to assess its ability to inactivate Ascaris suum eggs. The effect of free chlorine alone was also tested. The lowest egg inactivation results were found using Fe(II) or H2O2 separately (5 and 140 mmol L-1, respectively) in dark conditions, which showed about 28% inactivation of helminth eggs. By combining Fe(II) and H2O2 at the same concentrations described earlier, 55% of helminth egg inactivation was achieved. By increasing the reagent's concentration two-fold, 83% egg inactivation was achieved after 120 min of reaction time. Process efficiency was enhanced by solar excitation. Using solar disinfection only, the A. suum eggs inactivation reached was the lowest observed (58% egg inactivation after 120 min (120 kJ L (1))), compared with tests using the photo-Fenton process. The use of the photo-Fenton reaction enhanced the process up to over 99% of egg inactivation after 120 kJ L-1 when the highest Fe(II) and H2O2 concentration was tested. Practically no effect on the helminth eggs was observed with free chlorine alone after 550 mg min L-1 was used.

Murine L-929 cells were co-cultured with CoAW extract to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the corrosion products in vitro. Polarization tests indicated that CoAW is resistant to corrosion in the tested artificial saliva (AS)-based solutions (chloric solution, simple AS, fluorinated AS, and proteincontaining AS), and the amount of toxic copper ions released after immersion was lower than average daily dietary intake levels. The cytotoxicity experiments demonstrated the in vitro biocompatibility of CoAW.

The aim of this study was to evaluate physicochemical and microbial parameters that can be proposed as an indicator for the safety of swimming pools. A total of 234 water samples, over a 10-month period in 2006-2007, were collected from indoor swimming pools in Isfahan. All water samples were analyzed for physicochemical and microbial parameters including temperature, pH, turbidity, conductivity, free chlorine, heterotrophic plate count (HPC), total (TC) and fecal coliforms (FC), fecal streptococci (FS) Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). The highest isolation of microbial indicators was for total coliforms (38%) and the lowest for fecal streptococci (3%). The correlation analyses indicated that free chlorine concentration had a significant negative relationship with the heterotrophic bacteria population and total coliforms. Total coliforms presented a significant correlation with the other microbiological indicators. The results clearly showed that the hygienic quality of the swimming pools was dependent on the efficacy of disinfection. Thus, the free chlorine and pH were good operational indices for the quality control of swimming pools and must be maintained in the recommended range to ensure optimal disinfection. The results also showed that TC and HPC were reliable and practical indicators for routine quality surveillance and assessment of the efficiency of the disinfection process and safety of swimming pools.", "label": 1}

This project evaluated a chlorine dioxide based product (CDBP) (0.3% concentrate) as a hatchery sanitizer in decontaminating microbial populations on the shell surface of hatching eggs (> 18 d old), as well as its impact on hatchability and chick performance. Hatchers (0.20 m2) designed to hold approximately 50 eggs and equipped with circulation fans, heaters, and thermostats were used for the evaluation. For each of the 2 trials conducted, 450 hatching eggs were obtained and incubated in a common setter. Eggs used in trial 1 were floor eggs whereas in trial 2 nest eggs were used. On d 18 of incubation, eggs were removed from the setter, and viable eggs were randomly allocated to 9 hatchers. Pre-treatment egg rinse samples (10 eggs per hatcher) were collected for initial microbial analysis. Three hatchers were treated with CDBP and 3 hatchers with a formaldehyde based product (FBP). Three untreated hatchers served as control (C). Prior to hatch, 10 eggs/incubator, not previously rinsed, were used for post treatment microbial counts.

In this study, we report the first semi-commercial pilot-scale evaluation of a new process aid, T128, for its impact on enhancing the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorinated wash water against pathogen survival and cross-contamination. A non-pathogenic, BSL-1, strain of Escherichia coli O157:H7 was inoculated onto freshly harvested baby spinach leaves and washed with large amounts of freshly cut un-inoculated iceberg lettuce shreds in wash water with free chlorine periodically replenished, in the presence or absence of T128. Changes in water quality and pathogen survival and cross-contamination were monitored at every 2 min intervals for up to 36 min for each treatment during the wash operation. Results indicated that the use of T128 did not significantly (P>0.05) influence the rate of wash water deterioration, nor the pathogen populations remaining on the inoculated spinach leaves. However, in the absence of T128 (control), survival of E. coli O157:H7 in wash water and cross-contamination of un-inoculated lettuce frequently occurred when free chlorine in solution dropped below 1mg/l during the wash process. In contrast, the use of T128 significantly reduced the occurrence of E. coli O157:H7 surviving in wash water and of cross-contamination to un-inoculated shredded iceberg lettuce under the same operational conditions, suggesting that the application of T128 in a chlorine-based fresh produce sanitization system could increase the safety margin of process control on fresh-cut operations.", "label": 1}

Triphosphate derivative of 2CdA is commonly considered to be the agent inducing cell apoptosis resulting from inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerases and DNA repair. Recent studies on toxicity of 2CdA showed that the nucleoside possesses inhibitory activity against enzymes which are responsible for metabolism of deoxyadenosine, which suggests that the mechanism of toxicity by 2CdA includes a block in dAdo metabolic pathways which is very important for normal function of immune system cells. The agent under discussion and two other adenosine analogues (i.e. fludarabine and 2'-deoxycoformycin) which exhibit cytotoxicity against dividing and resting lymphocytes revolutionized the treatment of indolent lymphoid malignancies (i.e. chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cutaneous T cell lymphoma and hairy cell leukemia). Particularly, in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine demonstrated excellent efficacy, achieved after a single 7-day course, with an acceptable tolerability profile, suggesting that cladribine is likely to be more effective than other agents recommended in this disease. Preliminary clinical data, extremely encouraging in the case of 2CdA indicate that biomolecular mechanisms of the drug cytotoxicity is worth wide presentation.

Viable but nonculturable (VBNC) P. aeruginosa undetected by direct culturing following exposure to free chlorine or copper ions can survive in drinking water systems, with potential to recover, multiply, and regain infectivity. Cells were exposed to copper sulfate (0.25 mg Cu(2+) L(-1) ) or free chlorine (initial dose of 2 mg Cl2 L(-1) ) for 24 h. Despite total loss of culturability and a reduction in viability from 1.2 x 10(7) to 4 x 10(3) cells mL(-1) (3.5 log), cells exposed to chlorine recovered viability quickly after the depletion of free chlorine, while culturability was recovered within 24 h.

{"id": "7504", "title": "Impact of human activities on the ecology of nontuberculous mycobacteria", "abstract": "Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are environmental opportunistic pathogens of humans and animals. They are found in a wide variety of habitats to which humans are exposed, including drinking water distribution systems and household water and plumbing. In that regard, they are distinct from their obligate pathogenic relatives, the members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Owing to the presence of NTM in the human environment, human activities have had direct impacts on their ecology and thereby their epidemiology. NTM are oligotrophic, able to grow at low organic matter concentrations and over a wide range of temperatures, and even at low oxygen concentrations. Thus, NTM are normal inhabitants of natural waters and drinking waters. Discovery of the presence of NTM-polluted soils is not surprising in light of the ability of NTM to degrade a variety of hydrocarbon pollutants. A major human activity selecting for the growth and predominance of mycobacteria in habitats is disinfection. In comparison to other bacteria, NTM are disinfectant, heavy metal and antibiotic resistant. Therefore, the use of any antimicrobial agent selects for mycobacteria. Use of disinfectant in drinking water treatment selects for mycobacteria that can grow and come to proliferate in drinking water distribution systems in the absence of disinfectant-sensitive competing microorganisms. NTM selection may also occur as a consequence of antibiotics in drinking water sources.", "label": 1}

The MR rates were either 0.66 kg (MOD) or up to 1.1 kg (HI) of DM daily divided into 2 equal meals fed at 0630 and 1600 h daily. Calves fed MOD received 0.66 kg of DM from d 1 to 25, then 0.33 kg of DM in only the a.m. feeding from d 26 to 28. Calves fed HI received 0.79 kg of DM from d 1 to 7, 1.1 kg of DM from d 8 to 21, 0.66 kg of DM from d 22 to 25, and 0.33 kg of DM in the a.m. only from d 26 to 28. Free?choice starter (20% CP) and water was fed from d 1 to 56. Calves were initially 2 to 4 d of age and 47 \u00b1 1.2 kg. The 2 MR rates and 2 water treatments were analyzed as a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design with repeated measures. Cryptosporidium was the predominate organism found in the fecal samples. There was no effect of sanitation protocol on performance or health of calves. Calves fed HI MR had 18% greater ADG and more medical days over the 56-d trial than calves fed MOD MR, whereas there was no difference in hip width change.", "label": 1}

Cumulative carbonyl groups on the viral capsid protein were labeled using biotin hydrazide, and the biotinylated virions were separated using a spin column filled with avidin-immobilized gel. Rotavirus was treated with free chlorine at an initial concentration of 0.3 mg/L for 3 min, and the log reduction in the infectious titer was 0.19 log (standard deviation, SD = 0.05). The log reduction of rotavirus treated with free chlorine at an initial concentration of 0.6 mg/L for 3 min was 2.6 log (SD = 0.37). No significant reductions in the amplicon copy numbers were observed in these free chlorine-treated samples. The recovery levels of intact virions in the first three fractions after biotin-avidin affinity chromatography were 76, 21, and 2.8%, while those of virions treated with free chlorine at an initial concentration of 0.3 mg/L for 3 min were 70, 23, and 5.6%. These results showed that the proposed approach could discriminate a 0.19 log infectivity-reduced population from an intact population, although no reduction in the amplicon copy number was observed. This novel method could be applied to noncultivatable enteric viruses such as human norovirus and sapovirus, and it could be very helpful for evaluating the viral inactivation efficiencies of intervention measures.", "label": 0}

It contains numerous highly reactive chlorine and oxygen species, including HOCl(-1,) OCl-(1), Cl(-1), Cl(2), O(2-)(1), and O(3). This report presents data on the in vitro microbicidal activity of MDI-P against 4 clinically relevant microbial pathogens that are often difficult to eradicate. METHODS: MDI-P was generated from injection saline by using a patented electrolysis instrument. It was then tested for microbicidal activity at concentrations ranging from 0.01% to 50% against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, and Candida albicans (10(5) to 10(9) colony-forming units/mL). The effect of serum (50% and 90%) and pH on MDI-P activity were also tested. The morphologic effects of MDI-P on microbial cells were studied by light microscopy of cells stained by Gram's method and by transmission electron microscopy. Morbidity, mortality, and the effect of MDI-P on tissues were studied by using a mouse model. RESULTS: The microbicidal activity of MDI-P occurred within the first minute of exposure for all the organisms tested. When 50% MDI-P was tested against cell titers of 10(5) or 10(7) colony-forming units/mL, all test organisms were killed within 1 minute; at lower MDI-P concentrations, C albicans was the most sensitive organism, and L pneumophila was the most resistant. Even with beginning cell titers of 10(9) colony-forming units/mL, killing by 50% MDI-P was >99.9% for all test strains. Furthermore, at the same beginning cell titer, killing of C albicans by MDI-P diluted to 50% with normal human serum rather than injection saline was only slightly reduced. No acute morbidity, mortality, or tissue damage was detected in mice that were intravenously given 17 mL/kg of undiluted MDI-P. CONCLUSIONS: MDI-P is a very fast-acting, broad-spectrum microbicidal material. The lack of evidence for acute morbidity, mortality, or tissue injury, ease of preparation, and low cost suggest that it may be useful for various sterilization and disinfection applications.", "label": 0}

Such methods must be rapid and inexpensive. Coliphages were used as indicators to demonstrate the efficacy of quaternary ammonium compounds and chlorine bleach for the inactivation of viruses in chicken cages. The concentration of indigenous coliphages in chicken litter was found to be 10(4)-10(7) per gram and from 0 to 8,500 per 100 cm 2 of floor surface. To assess the effectiveness of the disinfectants, floor samples were collected pre and post disinfection. These results indicated that chlorine bleach was more effective than quaternary ammonium compounds in reducing the amount of indigenous coliphages. To obtain better quantitative data, MS-2 coliphage was sprayed onto cage floors, left overnight to dry, and then the surfaces disinfected. Similar results were obtained with both indigenous coliphages and MS-2. There appears to be no significant difference in coliphage reduction by increasing the contact time from 10 to 30 min. To ensure at least a 99.9% reduction of virus at least 236 ml of household bleach per 3.78 l should be used.", "label": 1}

There is great interest in developing novel decontamination treatments, which are both safe for consumers and more efficient against foodborne pathogens. In this study, emulsions of essential oils (EOs) from Origanum compactum (oregano), Eugenia caryophyllus (clove), and Zataria multiflora Boiss (zataria) were applied by spray (0.8 ml) after the sanitizing washing step. The aim was to investigate their ability to control the growth of potentially cross-contaminating pathogens and endogenous microbiota in commercial baby leaves, processed in a fresh-cut produce company. Zataria EO emulsions of 3%, 5% and 10% reduced Escherichia coli O157:H7 by 1.7, 2.2 and 3.5 log cfu/g in baby-leaf salads after 5 days of storage at 7 \u00b0C. By contrast, reductions in E. coli O157:H7 counts remained the same when clove was applied at concentrations of 5% and 10% (2.5 log cfu/g reduction). Oregano (10%) reduced inoculated E. coli O157:H7 counts in baby-leaf salads by a maximum of 0.5 log cfu/g after 5 days of storage. Zataria showed strong antimicrobial efficacy against E. coli O157:H7 and also against the endogenous microbiota of baby-leaf salads stored for 9 days. Feline calicivirus (FCV), a norovirus surrogate, survived on inoculated baby-leaf salads during refrigerated storage (9 days at 7 \u00b0C) regardless of treatment. Refrigeration temperatures completely annulled the effectiveness of the EOs against FCV inoculated in baby-leaf salads as occurred in FCV cultures. This study shows that EOs, and zataria in particular, have great potential use as an additional barrier to reduce contamination-related risks in baby-leaf salads. However, further research should be done into foodborne viruses in order to improve food safety.", "label": 0}
{"id": "6657", "title": "Use of DiaCell modules for the electro-disinfection of secondary-treated wastewater with diamond anodes", "abstract": "In this work, the disinfection of the effluent of the secondary treatment of a municipal wastewater treatment plant is studied using two stacks of commercial electrochemical cells powered with very low current densities (0.14-10 A m(-2)), in order to prevent the formation of chlorates and perchlorates during the electrolysis. Results demonstrate that this technology is robust and efficient and it can attain the complete disinfection of wastewater even at very low current densities. These low current densities are high enough to produce hypochlorite and chloramines (when ammonium is present in solution), being the disinfection process more efficient when the concentration of chloramines is higher. Therefore, the presence of hypochlorite together with higher concentrations of chloramines significantly improve the removal of microorganisms. In comparing the two stacks studied in this work, it was obtained that commercial DiaCell stacks containing bipolar connected electrodes are more efficient than those containing monopolar-connected electrodes for the disinfection. Differences are explained in terms of the higher cell voltage applied in that stack (higher current density in bipolar stack) that results in (1) an improved reduction of nitrates to ammonium (BDD cathode in bipolar stack) with the latter formation of chloramines as the main positive effect and (2) in the increase in the power consumed as the primary negative consequence.

Both assays were used to screen a panel of 38 faecal samples known to contain 17 different norovirus strains and 131 clinical samples collected from 60 gastroenteritis outbreaks of unknown aetiology. The NASBA assay detected 13 out of the 17 strains of norovirus in the characterised panel, failing to detect a single GII strain and three GI strains. There was 90% agreement between the two assays used to detect norovirus in clinical samples from outbreaks. NASBA detected norovirus RNA in all 64 samples positive by RT-PCR and also detected norovirus RNA in additional 13 samples that were negative by RT-PCR. The sensitivity and specificity of NASBA was 100% and 80%, respectively, compared to RT-PCR results. The norovirus NASBA assay was shown to be highly sensitive and specific, and its ease of use and rapid turnaround time makes it a favourable alternative to RT-PCR for the investigation of norovirus outbreaks.", "label": 0}

Methods: Eighty-five women, 26-28 weeks pregnant, were recruited for routine oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT); 45 had normal OGTT results and 40 were diagnosed with GDM. Electrolyte levels, including ionized and total Mg, were analyzed. Results: Gestational age and BMI were similar between the two groups (p = 0.800, p = 0.025). Multivitamin use was higher in the control group (p = 0.036). Fasting blood glucose was higher in the GDM group (p < 0.001). The median total Mg levels were 1.9 mg/dl (range 1.6-2.2) in the control group and 1.8 mg/dl (range 1.2-2.1) in the GDM group (p < 0.001). The median ionized Mg levels were 0.5 mmol/l (range 0.4-0.6) in the control group and 0.4 mmol/l (range 0.4-0.5) in the GDM group (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our study revealed a relationship between low total and ionized Mg levels and GDM, as in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The literature regarding type 2 DM and our findings suggest that Mg is the key ion in the pathophysiology of GDM. Low-dose Mg supplementation was not related to GDM; however, pharmacological doses in the various stages of pregnancy could be beneficial and should be investigated.", "label": 0}

In general, we quantify the degree of cross-contamination in terms of model parameters. Applying these results in the case of Escherichia coli O157:H7 contamination of fresh-cut romaine lettuce, we identify the mean wash time and free chlorine concentration as critical parameters.

Furthermore, unlike meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), MDE encompass several genera and multiple resistance mechanisms, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases, which complicate detection in the routine diagnostic laboratory. Current measures to contain spread in many hospitals are somewhat ad hoc as there are no formal national or international guidelines. Aim We sought to establish what should be the priorities for the prevention and control of MDE and what is feasible for implementation. We also identify areas for further research. Methods We reviewed the published literature and other sources e.g. national agencies, for measures and interventions used to control MDE. Findings Certain categories of at risk patients should be screened, especially in critical care areas, using appropriate laboratory methods. Standard and contact precautions are essential and hand hygiene compliance requires continued emphasis and high compliance levels. As MDE may persist on environmental surfaces for weeks, environmental decontamination could also be an effective control intervention. There are limited options for decolonisation with inadequate studies to date and antibiotic stewardship within and outside the hospital remains important.

To minimize such cases, chemical sanitations are applied. While chlorine is commonly used, concerns with its effectiveness and health implication have prompted researchers to seek alternatives. Peroxyacetic acid (PAA) has shown efficacy in inactivating foodborne pathogens on fresh vegetables, and hence could be considered as an alternative. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of chlorine and PAA in inactivating Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and natural microflora on mung bean sprouts. Resistance of non- and acid-adapted pathogens to these sanitizer treatments was also evaluated. Un-inoculated and inoculated sprouts were treated with chlorine at 106, 130 and 170 ppm and PAA at 25, 51 and 70 ppm for 90 and 180 s at room temperature. Overall, the greater log reductions were obtained with the increase in the sanitizer concentration. For 180 s, chlorine treatment at 170 ppm reduced 2.0, 1.3, 1.5, 0.9-logs and PAA treatment at 70 ppm resulted in 2.3, 1.8, 2.1, 1.1-log reductions for non-adapted E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and natural microflora, respectively. These results revealed that the efficacy of PAA was significantly better than or similar to that of chlorine. For acid-adapted cells, these sanitizer treatments were less effective with the ranges of 1.0-1.2-log reductions for chlorine and 1.1-1.6-log reductions for PAA compared to non-adapted cells, indicating that acid-adapted cells were more resistant to the sanitizing treatment. These data suggest that PAA may replace chlorine in the disinfection of mung bean sprouts and that acid-adapted pathogens should be used to design an effective sanitizing strategy.", "label": 1}

The efficacy of EP vapors for reducing E. coli O157:H7((GFP)) populations on green onions and baby spinach at 4 and 10 degrees C was monitored for 7 and 5 days, respectively. The lowest EP concentration (42 mg/liter) resulted in 1.7-log reduction of E. coli O157:H7((GFP)) on green onions after 7 days at 4 degrees C and a 1.9-log reduction after 5 days at 10 degrees C (P < 0.05). In baby spinach, the same concentration resulted in 0.9-log and 1.4-log reductions (P < 0.05) of E. coli O157:H7((GFP)) after 7 days at 4 degrees C and 5 days at 10 degrees C, respectively. On green onions, the highest concentration of EP (420 mg/liter) reduced the population of E. coli O157:H7((GFP)) by >4.7 log CFU/g after 7 days at 4 degrees C and 5 clays at 10 degrees C. The same concentration was also effective for reducing E. coli O157:H7((GFP)) populations in baby spinach by 4.3 log CFU/g after 7 days at 4 degrees C and by >6.5 log CFU/g after 3 days at 10 degrees C. Although the successful EP treatments minimally affected the sensory attributes of green onions, the treatments resulted in significant changes in the sensory attributes of baby spinach samples stored at 4 and 10 degrees C.

On a pilot-plant scale, lettuce heads were shredded with or without pre-washing (50 degrees C, no chlorine; 4 and 50 degrees C 200 mg/l free chlorine; 60 s). After shredding, lettuce was washed for 90 s (tap water, 4 degrees C, spin-dried, packaged in 200 g consumer-sized bags, and stored at 4 degrees C for <= 9 days. Samples were analyzed for their headspace 0, and CO, levels, sensory properties, microbiological status, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity at regular intervals throughout processing and storage. Parallelly, instrumental color and texture measurements were performed. All pre-washing procedures of lettuce heads lowered the initial counts of total aerobic bacteria, pseudomonades, and Enterobacteriaceae by >= 1.63, >= 1.55, and >= 1.85 log(10) cfu/g, respectively, while the single-wash of shredded lettuce in tap water without any pre-washing resulted in significantly smaller reduction rates (0.23, 0.11, and 0.71 log(10) cfu/g, respectively). During storage, all pre-washing procedures had a persistent effect on bacterial counts of the RTU lettuce. Furthermore, all pre-washing procedures delayed vascular tissue browning at cut edges and retarded the decline in the overall visual quality of the samples. Whereas wound-induced PAL synthesis was reduced by the use of warm water (+/- chlorine), O-2 depletion and CO, evolution in the corresponding bags were slightly enhanced, thus proving that processing kept the food as a living tissue.

The method includes bacterial cell concn. through membrane filtration, a short (6 h) culture-enrichment step, DNA extn. and its amplification through a Real-Time PCR assay. The performance of the mol. approach was evaluated on 44 samples of swimming pool water and compared with the ref. method UNI EN ISO 16266:2008. Positivity rates of 6% and 74% in pool and inlet water, resp., with the std. culture method, and of 23% and 74% with the mol. method were found. Statistical anal. indicated \"substantial agreement\" (Cohen's Kappa index: 0.6831) between the two approaches. RAPD typing of P. aeruginosa isolates showed identical fingerprint profiles, indicating their epidemiol. correlation. The developed protocol showed very high specificity and a detection limit of 10 genomic units. This technique has the potential to screen large nos. of environmental samples, and could be proposed as part of a self-monitoring plan for recreational facilities, improving surveillance and early warning systems.

{"id": "1289", "title": "Design, function and structure of a monomeric ClC transporter", "abstract": "Channels and transporters of the ClC family cause the transmembrane movement of inorganic anions in service of a variety of biological tasks, from the unusual-the generation of the kilowatt pulses with which electric fish stun their prey-to the quotidian-the acidification of endosomes, vacuoles and lysosomes. The homodimeric architecture of ClC proteins, initially inferred from single-molecule studies of an elasmobranch Cl- channel and later confirmed by crystal structures of bacterial Cl-/H+ antiporters, is apparently universal. Moreover, the basic machinery that enables ion movement through these proteins-the aqueous pores for anion diffusion in the channels and the ion-coupling chambers that coordinate Cl- and H+ antiport in the transporters-are contained wholly within each subunit of the homodimer. The near-normal function of a bacterial ClC transporter straitjacketed by covalent crosslinks across the dimer interface and the behaviour of a concatemeric human homologue argue that the transport cycle resides within each subunit and does not require rigid-body rearrangements between subunits. However, this evidence is only inferential, and because examples are known in which quaternary rearrangements of extramembrane ClC domains that contribute to dimerization modulate transport activity, we cannot declare as definitive a -? parallel-pathways-\u2122 picture in which the homodimer consists of two single-subunit transporters operating independently. A strong prediction of such a view is that it should in principle be possible to obtain a monomeric ClC. Here we exploit the known structure of a ClC Cl -/H+ exchanger, ClC-ec1 from Escherichia coli, to design mutants that destabilize the dimer interface while preserving both the structure and the transport function of individual subunits. The results demonstrate that the ClC subunit alone is the basic functional unit for transport and that cross-subunit interaction is not required for Cl-/H+ exchange in ClC transporters. \u00a9 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here the aim was to demonstrate the influence of surface finish of AISI 316 SS on colonization, biofilm formation and susceptibility of Salmonella Typhimurium to disinfection. Initial attachment of S. Typhimurium on surfaces of SS was four times lower, when surface was polished by Bright-Alum (BA) or Electropolishing (EP), as compared to Mechanical Sanded (MS) or the untreated surface (NT). The correlation between roughness and initial bacterial attachment couldn't account on its own to explain differences seen. Biofilms with similar thickness (15-18 mum) were developed on all surfaces 1-day post inoculation, whereas EP was the least covered surface (23%). Following 5-days, biofilm thickness was lowest on EP and MS (30 mum) and highest on NT (62 mum) surfaces. An analysis of surface composition suggested a link between surface chemistry and biofilm development, where the higher concentrations of metal ions in EP and MS surfaces correlated with limited biofilm formation. Interestingly, disinfection of biofilms with chlorine was up to 130 times more effective on the EP surface (0.005% surviving) than on the other surfaces. Overall these results suggest that surface finish should be considered carefully in a food processing plant.", "label": 0}

We included studies performed in acute-care hospitals. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS. We included studies conducted on hospitalized patients that investigated the impact of specific interventions on CDI rates. INTERVENTIONS. We used the QI-Minimum Quality Criteria Set (QI-MQCS) to assess the quality of included studies. Interventions were grouped thematically: environmental disinfection, antimicrobial stewardship, hand hygiene, chlorhexidine bathing, probiotics, bundled approaches, and others. A meta-analysis was performed when possible. RESULTS. Of 3,236 articles screened, 261 met the criteria for full-text review and 46 studies were ultimately included. The average quality rating was 82% according to the QI-MQCS. The most effective interventions, resulting in a 45% to 85% reduction in CDI, included daily to twice daily disinfection of high-touch surfaces (including bed rails) and terminal cleaning of patient rooms with chlorine-based products. Bundled interventions and antimicrobial stewardship showed promise for reducing CDI rates. Chlorhexidine bathing and intensified hand hygiene practices were not effective for reducing CDI rates. CONCLUSIONS. Daily and terminal cleaning of patient rooms using chlorine-based products were most effective in reducing CDI rates in hospitals. Further studies are needed to identify the components of bundled interventions that reduce CDI rates.", "label": 0}

This study investigated the effects of chlorine and ClO2 on purified HRV by using cell culture and RT-PCR to assess virus infectivity and genetic integrity, respectively. The disinfection efficacy of ClO2 was found to be higher than that of chlorine. According to the efficiency factor Hom model, Ct value (mg/L min) ranges required for a 4-log reduction of HRV at 20 degrees C by chlorine and ClO2 were 5.55-5.59 and 1.21-2.47 mg/L min, respectively. Detection of the 11 HRV genome segments revealed that damage to the 1227-2354 bp of the VP4 gene was associated with the disappearance of viral infectivity by chlorine. However, no complete accordance between culturing and RT-PCR assays was observed after treatment of HRV with ClO2. These results collectively indicate that the current practice of chlorine disinfection may be inadequate to manage the risk of waterborne HRV infection, and offer the potential to monitor the infectivity of HRV adapting PCR-based protocols in chlorine disinfection.", "label": 1}

The aim of this study was to develop and investigate the antibacterial function of chitosan-silver nano composites (CAgNCs) against fish pathogenic Aliivibrio salmonicida. Zeta potential and average size of synthesized CAgNCs were + 32.1 mV and 281 nm, respectively. The Ag content of the CAgNCs was 0.643 \u00b1 0.012% (w/w). Antibacterial results revealed that CAgNCs could inhibit the A. salmonicida growth which indicates minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) at 50 ?g/mL and 100 ?g/mL, respectively. We confirmed the attachment of AgNPs on the surface of A. salmonicida which indicates the interaction of CAgNCs with the bacterium. Propidium iodide (PI) uptake results suggested that CAgNCs has affected to permeability of cell membrane of A. salmonicida. Also, CAgNCs induced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in concentration and time dependent manner (up to 3 h) suggesting that it may generate oxidative stress leading to bacterial cell death. Also, the level of protein was decreased in A. salmonicida cells after CAgNCs (50 ?g/mL) treatment. DNA fragmentation assay results confirmed that CAgNCs can cause extensive DNA degradation of A. salmonicida which may inhibit the expression and production of bacterial proteins. Toxicity and safety results prove that CAgNCs is not toxic to zebrafish (Danio rerio) at 12.5 mg/kg of body weight/day as a feed ingredient and rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) testis cells up to 50 ?g/?L.

DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial over 20 weeks. SETTING: Family compounds, each containing several houses, in rural western Kenya. PARTICIPANTS: 6650 people in 605 family compounds. INTERVENTION: Water treatment: flocculant-disinfectant, sodium hypochlorite, and usual practice (control). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of diarrhoea and all cause mortality. Escherichia coli concentration, free residual chlorine concentration, and turbidity in household drinking water as surrogates for effectiveness of water treatment. RESULTS: In children < 2 years old, compared with those in the control compounds, the absolute difference in prevalence of diarrhoea was -25% in the flocculant-disinfectant arm (95% confidence interval -40 to -5) and -17% in the sodium hypochlorite arm (-34 to 4). In all age groups compared with control, the absolute difference in prevalence was -19% in the flocculant-disinfectant arm (-34 to -2) and -26% in the sodium hypochlorite arm (-39 to -9). There were significantly fewer deaths in the intervention compounds than in the control compounds (relative risk of death 0.58, P = 0.036). Fourteen per cent of water samples from control compounds had E coli concentrations < 1 CFU/100 ml compared with 82% in flocculant-disinfectant and 78% in sodium hypochlorite compounds. The mean turbidity of drinking water was 8 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) in flocculant-disinfectant households, compared with 55 NTU in the two other compounds (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In areas of turbid water, flocculant-disinfectant was associated with a significant reduction in diarrhoea among children < 2 years. This health benefit, combined with a significant reduction in turbidity, suggests that the flocculant-disinfectant is well suited to areas with highly contaminated and turbid water.", "label": 1}

An outbreak investigation was initiated with the objective of describing the epidemiological features of the hepatitis outbreak. Materials and Methods: House-to-house visits were undertaken to identify symptomatic cases. The outbreak was described in terms of person, place and time. Hypothesis was generated based on findings from descriptive study, laboratory investigation of water samples, and environmental observations. A case-control study was designed to test the hypothesis. Chi-square test, univariate analysis, and logistic regression to identify the risk factors associated with hepatitis A infection were done. Results: Line list generated consisted of 45 cases. Attack rate was the highest among the age group 15-24 years (4.6%) followed by 5-14 years (3.1%). The geographical distribution of the cases suggested a clustering around the water supply through the pipeline and epidemic curve showed a sharp rise in cases suggestive of a common source outbreak. Water samples collected form pipeline showed evidence of fecal contamination and absence of residual chlorine.

Most laboratories use approximately 25 to 50 ppm unbuffered chlorine solution for 5 to 10 min. Treatment of embryos with chlorine has significant germicidal effects for many Gram-negative bacteria, viruses, and trophozoite stages of protozoa, but is less effective against cyst or spore stages of protozoa and certain Mycobacterium spp. Therefore, we evaluated the toxicity of unbuffered and buffered chlorine solutions to embryos exposed at 6 or 24 h post-fertilization (hpf) to determine whether higher concentrations can be used for treating zebrafish embryos. Most of our experiments entailed using an outbred line (5D), with both mortality and malformations as endpoints. We found that 6 hpf embryos consistently were more resistant than 24 hpf embryos to the toxic effects of chlorine. Chlorine is more toxic and germicidal at lower pH, and chlorine causes elevated pH. Consistent with this, we found that unbuffered chlorine solutions (pH ca. 8-9) were less toxic at corresponding concentrations than solutions buffered to pH 7. Based on our findings here, we recommend treating 6 hpf embryos for 10 min and 24 hpf embryos for 5 min with unbuffered chlorine solution at 100 ppm.", "label": 0}

Animals were envenomated by intramuscular injection of SSV at a dosage of 0.34 mg/kg. Systemic hemodynamics showed no significant changes except for a tendency of decrease in cardiac output (CO). The glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the rate of urine flow (V) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), and effective renal blood flow (ERBF) significantly decreased, while filtration fraction (FF) significantly increased at 180 min after envenomation. Envenomated animals showed a reduction in renal fraction (RF), while renal vascular resistance (RVR) increased stepwise throughout the experimental periods. Animals pretreated with sodium bicarbonate showed no significant changes of CO, TPR MAP, HR, and packed cell volume (PCV) while receiving sea snake venom. Animals pretreated with sodium bicarbonate showed no changes in GFR, ERPF, ERBF, RF, and RVR after envenomation. The rate of urine flow markedly increased in envenomated animals which received pretreatment with bicarbonate. After envenomation alone, there were no differences in the plasma concentration of sodium (PNa) and chloride (PCl) as compared to the control value, whereas the plasma concentration of potassium (PK) increased at 180 min after envenomation. Animals pre-treated with bicarbonate showed a stepwise increase in both UNaV, FE(NA), U(Cl)V, and FE(Cl) accompanying SSV injection. Neither PNa nor PCl were affected, while PK significantly decreased in animals given SSV with bicarbonate loading. UKV and FEK increased stepwise in envenomated animals treated with bicarbonate throughout the period of study. All groups of animals given SSV, with or without NaHCO3 infusion, showed a marked elevation of the concentration of urinary myoglobin (U(Mb)), plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and plasma creatine phosphokinase (CPK) throughout experimental periods. The urinary myoglobin excretion markedly increased in animals after SSV injection accompanied by NaHCO3 infusion. It can be concluded that large amounts of myoglobin present in the renal tubules in envenomated animals can precipitate, particularly under acidic conditions, resulting in increased intratubular pressure and subsequently decreased renal hemodynamics including GFR and ERBF. An infusion of NaHCO3 to render urine more alkaline could have a protective role against depression of renal function following sea snake venom administration.", "label": 0}

However, mechanical operations of cutting and peeling induce the liberation of cellular contents at the site of wounding that can promote the growth of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms. In addition, rates of tissue senescence can be enhanced resulting in reduced storage life of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables. Chlorine has been widely adopted in the disinfection and washing procedures of fresh-cut produce due to its low cost and efficacy against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Continuous replenishment of chlorine in high organic wash water can promote the formation of carcinogenic compounds such as trihalomethanes, which threaten human and environmental health.

{"id": "1414", "title": "Inactivation of foot-and-mouth disease virus by commercially available disinfectants and cleaners", "abstract": "Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is an animal pathogen of great concern. It is contagious to cloven-hoofed animals and affects animals in extensive areas worldwide. In general, the primary eradication strategies for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Japan are stamping out the disease and restriction of movement. It is also important to completely disinfect the infected area to prevent the spread of FMDV, including vehicles and people as well. However, there is no report on the effect of commercially available disinfectants against FMDV in a short contact time. In this study, we evaluated the virucidal effect of thirteen commercially available products, and got the following results: acidic ethanol disinfectants, alkaline cleaners and sodium hypochlorite had great effect (>3.0 log<inf>10</inf> reduction in titer) against FMDV. On the other hand, neutral ethanol disinfectants, hand soaps, and quaternary ammonium compound sanitizers did not show great effect against FMDV. Therefore, it is presumed that acidic ethanol disinfectants are effective for human use and alkaline cleaners are effective for use in the infected environment for the control of a FMD outbreak.", "label": 1}

To study the effect of inoculum size, red, ripe tomatoes were spot-inoculated with bacterial suspensions (10(5) and 10(8) CFU/fruit) and stored at 22degreesC under 100% relative humidity. The effects of temperature (12, 22, and 30degreesC) and relative humidity (75, 85, and 97%) on attachment of the pathogen (10(7) CFU/fruit) to tomatoes (red and green) and ripe tomatillos were also evaluated. Inoculated fruits were stored for 90 min at all combinations of temperature and relative humidity, and after rinsing with water, the number of cells attached to the surface was determined. Salmonella Montevideo attached to the surface of tomatoes within 90 min. A direct correlation between the number of attached cells and the population in the inoculum was observed. The percentage of cells that attached immediately after inoculation was approximately 0.3% for the three test products. After storage for 90 min at various temperature and relative humidity conditions, the number of adhering cells ranged from 4.0 to 5.4 log CFU/fruit (1.2% of inoculum). Both the type of product and the temperature/relative humidity combination had a significant (P < 0.05) effect on attachment of Salmonella Montevideo to the surfaces of tomatoes and tomatillos. Scanning electron micrographs of the cuticles of inoculated washed tomatoes and tomatillos revealed typical skin cell patterns, and only a few randomly dispersed Salmonella Montevideo were observed. Deposition of Salmonella Montevideo on the surface of tomatoes and tomatillos could result in attachment and subsequent colonization under suitable conditions.", "label": 0}

The liposome surface was covered with polyethylene glycol to avoid migration toward the reticuloendothelial system and to prolong its presence in the bloodstream. Liposome-infused doxorubicin hydrochloride (DXR), an anthracycline was used as an anticancer antibiotic substance. Methods: Each AJ mouse was transplanted with 1 \u00d7 105 C-1300 murine neuroblastoma cells subcutaneously in the thigh. The experiment was conducted when the maximum tumor dimension was 1 cm. The control group was given only physiological saline solutions, the second group was given DXR alone, and the third group received liposomeinfused DXR (Lip-DXR). The survival and doubling times were measured. One, 12, and 24 hours after the injection the DXR concentration in the cardiac tissues was measured for statistical comparison. Results: The survival time of the mice was found to be 27 \u00b1 5.10 days in the control group, 31.40 \u00b1 3.15 days in the DXR group, and 43.86 \u00b1 2.13 days in the Lip-DXR group. The Lip-DXR group showed the longest survival time. The tumordoubling time was found to be 9.07 \u00b1 2.30, 10.75 \u00b1 3.49, and 19.80 \u00b1 3.26 days, for each group, respectively. When comparing the DXR concentration in the heart tissues, the Lip-DXR-administered mice showed significantly lower DXR accumulation in the cardiac tissues after 1 and 12 hours than the DXR-administered mice. Conclusion: This study proved that liposome-infused DXR could be used effectively on murine neuroblastoma (C-1300 tumor cell model) and may reduce the incidence of cardiac toxicity as compared with DXR alone.", "label": 0}

It is the second most potent mutagenic disinfection by-product of chlorination ever reported. Six of seven new synthetic analogs of this compound are direct-acting mutagens in Ames tester strain TA-100. Computed energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (E(LUMO)) and of the radical anion stability (DeltaH(f)(rad)-DeltaH(f)) from MNDO-PM3 for the chloroimides show a quantitative correlation with the Ames TA-100 bacterial mutagenicity values. The molar mutagenicities of these direct acting mutagenic imides having an exocyclic double bond fit the same linear correlation (lnM(m) vs. E(LUMO); lnM(m) vs. DeltaH(f)(rad)--DeltaH(f)) as the chlorinated 2(5H)-furanones, including the potent mutagen MX, 3-chloro-4-(dichloro-methyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone, a by-product of water chlorination and paper bleaching with chlorine. Mutagenicity data for related haloimides having endocyclic double bonds are also given. For the same number of chlorine atoms, the imides with endocyclic double bonds have significantly higher Ames mutagenicity compared to their structural analogs with exocyclic double bonds, but do not follow the same E(LUMO) or DeltaH(f)(rad)-DeltaH(f) correlation as the exocyclic chloroimides and the chlorinated 2(5H)-furanones.", "label": 0}
{"id": "6535", "title": "Assessment of anoxia tolerance and photoperiod dependence of GABAergic polarity in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis", "abstract": "The pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis is reported to be anoxia-tolerant and if the tolerance mechanism is similar to that of the anoxia-tolerant painted turtle, GABA should play an important role. A potentially confounding factor investigating the role of GABA in anoxia tolerance are reports that GABA has both inhibitory and excitatory effects within L. stagnalis central ganglion. We therefore set out to determine if seasonality or photoperiod has an impact on: 1) the anoxia-tolerance of the intact pond snail, and 2) the response of isolated neuroganglia cluster F neurons to exogenous GABA application. L. stagnalis maintained on a natural summer light cycle were unable to survive any period of anoxic exposure, while those maintained on a natural winter light cycle survived a maximum of 4h. Using intracellular sharp electrode recordings from pedal ganglia cluster F neurons we show that there is a photoperiod dependent shift in the response to GABA. Snails exposed to a 16h:8h light:dark cycle in an environmental chamber (induced summer phenotype) exhibited hyperpolarizing inhibitory responses and those exposed to a 8h:16h light:dark cycle (induced winter phenotype) exhibited depolarizing excitatory responses to GABA application. Using gramicidin-perforated patch recordings we also found a photoperiod dependent shift in the reversal potential for GABA. We conclude that the opposing responses of L. stagnalis central neurons to GABA results from a shift in intracellular chloride concentration that is photoperiod dependent and is likely mediated through the relative efficacy of cation chloride co-transporters. Although the physiological ramifications of the photoperiod dependent shift are unknown this work potentially has important implications for the impact of artificial light pollution on animal health.", "label": 0}

Because of the importance of this sector in the Brazilian economy, food safety must be ensured by control and monitoring of the production stages susceptible to contamination, such as the chilling process. The goal of this study was to evaluate changes in microbial levels on chicken carcasses and in chilling water after immersion in a chilling system for 8 and 16 h during commercial processing. An objective of the study was to encourage discussion regarding the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture Livestock and Food Supply regulation that requires chicken processors to completely empty, clean, and disinfect each tank of the chilling system after every 8-h shift. Before and after immersion chilling, carcasses were collected and analyzed for mesophilic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, and Escherichia coli. Samples of water from the chilling system were also analyzed for residual free chlorine. The results do not support required emptying of the chiller tank after 8 h; these tanks could be emptied after 16 h. The results for all carcasses tested at the 8- and 16-h time points indicated no significant differences in the microbiological indicators evaluated. These data provide both technical and scientific support for discussing changes in federal law regarding the management of immersion chilling water systems used as part of the poultry processing line.", "label": 0}

Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents with a large share of industrial input of different sampling dates were evaluated for mutagenic activity by the Ames Fluctuation Test and chemically characterized by a screening for suspected pro-mutagens and non-targeted software-based peak detection in full scan data. Areas of automatically detected peaks were used as predictor matrix for partial least squares projections to latent structures (PLS) in combination with measured mutagenic activity. Detected peaks were successively reduced by the exclusion of all peaks with lowest variable importance until the best model (high R(2) and Q(2)) was reached. Peaks in the best model co-varying with the observed mutagenicity showed increased chlorine, bromine, sulfur, and nitrogen abundance compared to original peak set indicating a preferential selection of anthropogenic compounds. The PLS regression revealed four tentatively identified compounds, newly identified 4-(dimethylamino)-pyridine, and three known micropollutants present in domestic wastewater as co-varying with the mutagenic activity. Co-variance between compounds stemming from industrial wastewater and mutagenic activity supported the application of \"virtual\" EDA as a statistical tool to separate toxicologically relevant from less relevant compounds.", "label": 0}

Sodium hypochlorite was used for chlorinating the DMH coated fabric in order to introduce antibacterial properties. An orthogonal array testing strategy (OATS) was used in the finishing process for finding the optimum treatment conditions. After finishing, UV-Visible spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) were employed to characterise the properties of the treated cotton fabric, including the concentration of chlorine, morphological properties, and functional groups. The results show that cotton fabric coated with DMH followed by plasma treatment and chlorination can inhibit S. aureus and that the antibacterial property is regenerable.", "label": 0}

This phage was chosen because of its structural characteristics and former investigations conducted in this laboratory. F116 was shown to be sensitive to a sodium hypochlorite concentration of 0.0075 gl-1 (available chlorine) which produced a 5 log10 reduction in titre in a suspension test. Survival bacteriophages challenged with this sodium hypochlorite concentration were isolated, propagated and challenged again with the same and higher concentrations of the biocide. It was observed that progeny virions were becoming increasingly resistant to sodium hypochlorite challenges up to a concentration of 0.0175 gl-1 of available chlorine. It was also noticed that 1-2 log10 of F116 virions from resistant phage lysates remained sensitive to the biocide. An electron microscopical investigation of F116 resistant lysates showed that the phage resistance to sodium hypochlorite was not caused by F116 particles aggregation. Furthermore, no morphological difference between the sensitive and resistant F116 particles to sodium hypochlorite was identified.", "label": 1}

First, it was shown that CAR 1,9a-dioxygenase (CARDO) catalyzed angular dioxygenation of all mono- to triCDF/Ds investigated in this study, but DF 4,4a-dioxygenase (DFDO) did not degrade 2,7-diCDD. Secondly, degradation of CDF/Ds by the sets of three enzymes (angular dioxygenase, extradiol dioxygenase, and meta-cleavage compound hydrolase) was examined, showing that these enzymes in both strains were able to convert 2-CDF to 5-chlorosalicylic acid but not other tested substrates to the corresponding chlorosalicylic acid (CSA) or chlorocatechol (CC). Finally, we tested the potential of both wild-type strains for cooxidation of CDF/Ds and demonstrated that both strains degraded 2-CDF, 2-CDD, and 2,3-diCDD to the corresponding CSA and CC. We investigated the sites for the attack of angular dioxygenases in each CDF/D congener, suggesting the possibility that the angular dioxygenation of 2-CDF, 2-CDD, 2,3-diCDD, and 1,2,3-triCDD (10 ppm each) by both DFDO and CARDO occurred mainly on the nonsubstituted aromatic nuclei.", "label": 0}

It is increasingly used for the disinfection of homes and other indoor environments afflicted by mold. However, little is known regarding the interaction of chlorine dioxide and indoor materials, particularly as related to the removal of chlorine dioxide from air. Such removal may be undesirable with respect to the subsequent formation of localized zones of depleted disinfectant concentrations and potential reductions in disinfection effectiveness in a building. The focus of this paper is on chlorine dioxide removal from air to each of 24 different indoor materials. Experiments were completed with materials housed in flow-through 48-L stainless steel chambers under standard conditions of 700 ppm chlorine dioxide inlet concentration, 75% relative humidity, 24 degrees C, and 0.5 h(-1) air changes. Chlorine dioxide concentration profiles, deposition velocities, and reaction probabilities are described in this paper. Deposition velocities and reaction probabilities varied over approximately 2 orders of magnitude across all materials. For most materials, deposition velocity decreased significantly over a 16-h disinfection period; that is, materials became smaller sinks for chlorine dioxide with time. Four materials (office partition, ceiling tile, medium density fiberboard, and gypsum wallboard) accounted for the most short- and long-term consumption of chlorine dioxide. Deposition velocity was observed to be a strong function of chlorine dioxide inlet concentration, suggesting the potential importance of chemical reactions on or within test materials.", "label": 0}

HAV and HRV showed little inactivation in all conditions. PV showed more than a 4 log10 titer reduction in the presence of copper and silver combined with 0.5 mg of FC per liter or in the presence of 1 mg of FC per liter alone. Human adenovirus persisted longer than PV with the same treatments, although it persisted significantly less than HRV or HAV. The addition of 700 micrograms of copper and 70 micrograms of silver per liter did not enhance the inactivation rates after the exposure to 0.5 or 0.2 mg of FC per liter, although on some occasions it produced a level of inactivation similar to that induced by a higher dose of FC alone. Virus aggregates were observed in the presence of copper and silver ions, although not in the presence of FC alone. Our data indicate that the use of copper and silver ions in water systems may not provide a reliable alternative to high levels of FC for the disinfection of viral pathogens. Gene probe-based procedures were not adequate to monitor the presence of infectious HAV after disinfection. PV does not appear to be an adequate model viral strain to be used in disinfection studies. Bacteroides fragilis bacteriophages were consistently more resistant to disinfection than PV, suggesting that they would be more suitable indicators, although they survived significantly less than HAV or HRV.", "label": 1}

Viral and bacterial pathogens account for the majority of cases that have an infectious cause; however, intestinal protozoan parasites are important but often under-recognized etiologic agents for infectious diarrhea. Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia lamblia are the most common intestinal protozoal infections in both resource-limited and resource-abundant countries and predominately affect children, usually those between ages 1\u20139\u00a0years and most often in children less than 4\u00a0years of age. Both Cryptosporidium and Giardia are ubiquitous in the environment and transmit primarily through the fecal-oral route after ingestion of oocysts/cysts in contaminated water or food or direct person-to-person contact. Both are environmentally hardy. The chlorine-tolerant Cryptosporidium oocysts in particular have led to more diarrheal outbreaks due to treated recreational water exposure than any other pathogen. Despite notifiable diseases in the USA, reporting is very low and thus general awareness of epidemiology and clinical manifestations is limited. Underdiagnosis can further contribute to under-reporting, especially in asymptomatic patients and where specialty consultation and reliable diagnostics are absent. Once a diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis has been confirmed, in addition to appropriate case reporting and treatment considerations, it is essential to provide educational support to children and their parents or caregivers to prevent further transmission of the disease within the household and throughout the community.", "label": 1}

The use of such packaging materials is not meant to be a substitute for good sanitation practices, but it should enhance the safety of food as an additional hurdle for the growth of pathogenic and/or spoilage microorganisms. Studies have focused on establishing methods for coating low-density polyethylene film or barrier films with methyl cellulose as a carrier for nisin. These films have significantly reduced the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in solutions and in vacuum packaged hot dogs. Other research has focused on the use of chitosan to inhibit L. monocytogenes and chlorine dioxide sachets for the reduction of Salmonella on modified atmosphere-packaged fresh chicken breasts.

For this Special Issue, graphic profiles have been prepared of the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity data available in the submissions to OPP. Also, a discussion is presented about how toxicity data are used to help establish tolerances (limits of pesticide residues in foods). The mutagenicity results submitted by registrants are supplemented by data on these chemicals from the open literature to provide a full perspective of their genetic toxicology. The group of chloroacetanilides reviewed here display a consistent pattern of mutagenic activity, probably mediated via metabolites.

This study examined the effects of different concentrations of NaCl on the survival of murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1), which was used as a human NoV surrogate, and HAV in experimentally contaminated raw oysters during 72-h storage at 10 \u00b0C. Both MNV-1 and HAV titers significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased by stepwise increases in NaCl and storage time; however, MNV-1 was more resistant to NaCl than HAV. The overall reductions in MNV-1 and HAV titers in oysters incubated with 10%, 7%, 5%, 3%, and 0% NaCl were 0.61 and 1.20, 0.50 and 0.89, 0.35 and 0.64, 0.25 and 0.42, and 0.07 and 0.25 log10 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/mL, respectively. A 1.23 log (94.11%) reduction of MNV-1 and 2.45 log (99.65%) reduction of HAV survival also occurred in 10% NaCl-containing oysters at 72 h of storage. Using the first-order reaction model, we determined that the MNV-1 decimal reduction time (D-value) was 64 h at 10% NaCl, whereas D-values of 63 h, 47 h, and 31 h were obtained for HAV at 5%, 7%, and 10% NaCl, respectively. This study suggests that NaCl concentrations of ? 10% could be potentially used for inactivation of NoV and HAV in traditional Korean foods, including those containing raw oysters such as Eoriguljeot and fermented Jeotgals.", "label": 0}

The biosensor consisted of a bioluminescent bioreporter (Pseudomonas fluorescens 5RL), an optical transducer (photomultiplier tube), and a light-tight chamber housing, the bioreporter and the transducer. The bioluminescent recombinant P. fluorescens 5RL in the biosensor allowed for online monitoring of bioluminescence during ClO(2) gas disinfection. Experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of the two key physical parameters associated with ClO(2) disinfection: relative humidity (40, 60, 80%) and ClO(2) gas concentration (0.5, 1.0, 1.6, 2.1 mg/l) on the bioreporter. Results showed that increasing concentrations of ClO(2) gas corresponded to a faster decrease in luminescence. The rates of luminescence decrease from P. fluorescens 5RL, and the log reduction time (LRT, time required to obtain 1-log reduction in luminescence) were calculated for each treatment tested. The LRT values of luminescence were 103, 78, 53, and 35 s for 0.5, 1.0, 1.6, and 2.1 mg/l of ClO(2) gas treatment, respectively, at 78% relative humidity. The gas concentration which caused a tenfold change in LRT (z value) for luminescence of P. fluorescens 5RL was 3.4 mg/l of ClO(2). The prototype biosensor showed potential for many applications, such as monitoring real-time microbial inactivation and understanding parameters that influence the efficacy of gaseous decontamination procedures.", "label": 0}

Salmonella was inoculated onto whole cantaloupe and honeydew melon to a final concentration of 4.65 log10 CFU/cm2 and 3.13 log10 CFU/g, respectively. Inoculated whole melons stored at 5\u00b0C for up to 7 days were washed with water, 2.5% and 5% hydrogen peroxide at day 0 and 5. Hydrogen peroxide (2.5% and 5%) treatments of whole melon for 5 min caused a 3 log10 CFU/cm2 reduction of the indigenous surface microflora and a 3.0 log10 CFU/cm2 reduction in Salmonella spp. on all melon surfaces. The efficacy of the hydrogen peroxide treatments was less when the interval between inoculation and treatment of cantaloupe exceeded 24 h. Unlike cantaloupe fresh-cut pieces, Salmonella was not recovered from fresh-cut pieces prepared from treated whole honeydew melon. Growth of Salmonella occurred in cantaloupe fresh-cut pieces stored at 10 or 20 \u00b0C, and by 2 weeks, levels reached approximately 1 log CFU/g. A rapid decline in appearance and overall acceptability was observed in fresh-cut pieces prepared from untreated whole cantaloupe. While Salmonella was recovered from fresh-cut pieces from and whole treated cantaloupe, sanitizing the surface of contaminated whole melons with hydrogen peroxide before and after cutting and storage of the fresh-cut pieces at 5 \u00b0C can enhance the microbial safety and acceptability rating for about 2 weeks after processing.", "label": 0}

In this context, several animal and plant peptides with potential bioactivity have been reported. Milk proteins and peptides have received much attention as a source of health-enhancing components to be incorporated into nutraceuticals and functional foods. By using this source, 24 peptides have been fractionated and purified from human milk using RP-HPLC. Multifunctional roles including antimicrobial, antioxidant and growth stimulating activity have been evaluated in all 24 fractions. Nevertheless, only four fractions show multiple combined activities among them. Using a proteomic approach, two of these four peptides have been identified as lactoferrin derived peptide and kappa casein short chain peptide. Lactoferrin derived peptide (f8) is arginine-rich and kappa casein derived (f12) peptide is proline-rich. Both peptides (f8 and f12) showed antimicrobial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Fraction 8 (f8) exhibits growth stimulating activity in 3T3 cell line and f12 shows higher free radical scavenging activity in comparison to other fractions. Finally, both peptides were in silico evaluated and some insights into their mechanism of action were provided. Thus, results indicate that these identified peptides have multiple biological activities which are valuable for the quick development of the neonate and may be considered as potential biotechnological products for nutraceutical industry.", "label": 0}

In all, eight MX derivatives were assayed. Several were studied together in at least one assay. In addition to MX, the seven included 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (RMX, 2), 3-chloro-4-(chloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (3), 3-chloro-4-(chloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (4), 4-(chloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (5), 4-chloromethyl-2(5H)-furanone (6), and 4-(dichloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (8). Compounds 1-6 were mutagenic. Compound 8 gave erratic results. 4-(Acetoxymethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (11) was nonmutagenic. The largest drop in mutagenicity amounted to a factor of about 10(2) for the replacement of the hydroxyl group or a C-3 chlorine atom from 3. Other replacements of the hydroxyl group or a C-3 or C-6 chlorine atom amounted to mutagenicity diminished by a factor of only 10. On the basis of the rates of UV spectral changes under assay conditions, chemical half-life values ((c)t1/2) for 1-6 and 8 were estimated as indicators of compound stability. However, mutagenicity differences were shown to result prinicipally from the intrinsic mutagenicities of the six compounds 1-6 rather than from differences in stability. Plots of mutagenicity against the C-13 chemical shifts for C-2, C-3, and C-4 (delta-C-2, delta-C-3, delta-C-4) in compounds 1-6 resulted in each case in a linear dependency. Plots of mutagenicity against delta-C-2 and delta-C-4 had negative slopes. The plot of mutagenicity against delta-C-3 gave a positive slope. The correlations were attributed to the dependence of mutagenicity on electron density at C-2, C-3, and C-4.", "label": 0}

However, much of the research on the disinfection of bacterial cells by UV has focused on planktonic cells. Many bacterial cells in nature are present in clumps or aggregates, and these aggregates, which are more resistant to disinfection than their planktonic counterparts, can be problematic in engineered water systems. The current research used Pseudomonas putida ( P. putida) CP1, an environmental and non-pathogenic microorganism which autoaggregates when grown under certain conditions, as a model organism to simulate aggregated cells. The study investigated the response of both the planktonic and the aggregated forms of the bacterium to UV-C ( lambda = 253.7 nm) and UV-A/B ( lambda > 300 nm) disinfection at laboratory scale in a minimal medium. The planktonic cells of P. putida CP1 were inactivated within 60 s by UV-C and in 60 min by UV-A/B; however, the aggregated cells required 120 min of UV-C treatment and 240 min of UV-A/B radiation to become inactive. The size of the aggregate was reduced following UV treatment. Although all the cells had lost culturability, viability as measured by the LIVE/DEAD (R) stain and epifluorescence microscopy was not completely lost and the cells all demonstrated regrowth after overnight incubation in the dark.", "label": 0}

Preliminary studies indicated that water washes, EDTA (0.002 to 0.2 M) or nisin (5 to 10 ?g/mL) were not effective in reducing the microflora of whole melon when used individually. Nisin-EDTA and chlorine treatments were significantly (P < 0.05) more effective in reducing native microflora than water washes. Nisin-EDTA treatments were significantly (P < 0.05) more effective than chlorine in reducing populations of yeast and mold and Pseudomonas spp. on whole melon surfaces but were not as effective as chlorine treatments for reducing aerobic mesophilic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and total gram-neg. bacteria. Microbial contaminants on fresh-cut pieces washed with 50 ppm chlorine or nisin-EDTA were further reduced. However, microbial populations increased throughout refrigerated storage irresp. of treatments. Odor, appearance, and overall acceptability ratings for cantaloupe and honeydew fresh-cut pieces treated with nisin-EDTA or chlorine were not significantly (P > 0.05) different from each other throughout the storage period (15 to 21 days). However, both treatments led to significantly (P < 0.05) improved ratings compared to the controls for the fresh-cut pieces at 9 to 12 days of storage and thereafter. The results of this study suggest that treatments with nisin-EDTA before and after fresh-cut processing would improve the quality and extend the shelf-life of fresh-cut melon.

We compared the levels of reduction in infectivities of CSV and Aichi virus (AiV) after exposure to extreme pHs, 56 degrees C heating, alcohols, chlorine on surfaces, and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP), using the same matrix and identical test parameters for all viruses, as well as the reduction of human norovirus RNA levels under these conditions. At pH 2, FCV was inactivated by 6 log10 units, whereas MNV, TuV, and AiV were resistant. All CSV were completely inactivated at 56 degrees C within 20 min.

Strawberry puree was inoculated with ~ 106 PFU/g of MNV-1 and treated at 350 MPa for 2 min at initial sample temperatures of 0, 5, 10 and 20 \u00b0C. MNV-1 became more sensitive to HHP as initial sample temperature decreased from 20 to 0 \u00b0C. To determine the effect of pressure cycling on MNV-1 inactivation, inoculated puree samples were treated at 300 MPa and 0 \u00b0C with 1, 2 and 4 cycles. Pressure cycling offered no distinct advantage over continuous HHP treatment. To determine the effect of presence of water during HHP on MNV-1 inactivation, strawberries inoculated with ~ 4 \u00d7 105 PFU/g of MNV-1 were either pressure-treated directly (dry state) or immersed in water during pressure treatment. MNV-1 was very resistant to pressure under the dry state condition, but became sensitive to pressure under the wet state condition. The inactivation curves of MNV-1 in strawberry puree and on strawberries were obtained at 300 and 350 MPa and initial sample temperature of 0 \u00b0C. Except for the curve of strawberries treated at 350 MPa which had a concave downward shape, the other three curves were almost linear with R2 value of 0.99.

{"id": "1929", "title": "Characterisation of potential virulence markers in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from drinking water", "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from tap water, mineral water, and artesian well water were investigated for their ability to produce different potential virulence factors or markers such as hemolysins, hemaglutinins, cytotoxins and their ability to adhere to epithelial cells and to abiotic surfaces. The susceptibility to antibiotics, human serum sensitivity and the survival of P. aeruginosa isolates in a chlorinated environment were also examined. Of the 30 isolates tested, 16 possessed the capacity to adhere to abiotic surfaces, and 28 to adhere to epithelial cells; 30 were capable of producing hemolysins, 27 produced cytotoxins, 9 hemagglutinins, and 18 were classified as serum-resistant. For the lowest concentration of chlorine (0.2 mg/l) tested, no killing of biofilm bacteria could be discerned, even after prolonged exposure to the agent. Although all the drinking water isolates were susceptible to aztreonam, cefepime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and polymyxin, the P. aeruginosa isolates were resistant to one or more antibiotics. The increasing prevalence of resistance in the isolates from environmental sources may have important therapeutic implications. A notable proportion of the P. aeruginosa isolates from drinking water were able to develop virulence factors, and the incidence of virulence properties was not statistically different among the three sources. A more extensive study of the virulence properties of this bacterium by toxic assays on animals should be explored. Still more interesting would be toxicity assays on immuno-deficient animals with isolates from drinking water in order to better understand the health risk these bacteria may present.", "label": 1}

Cantaloupes (Cucumis melo L. var. reticulates) were immersed in an inoculum containing Salmonella enterica serovar Poona or Pantoea agglomerans at ca. 10(4) to 10(5) CFU/ml. An efficient method for the recovery of bacteria from the cantaloupe surface was developed and validated. The method consisted of washing the entire melon with Butterfield's buffer containing 1% Tween 80 in a plastic bag placed inside a plastic pail affixed to an orbital shaker. Levels of S. enterica Poona recovered by washing the entire melon were significantly higher than those recovered by the more common laboratory method of blending the rind. P. agglomerans can be used as a non-pathogenic proxy for S. enterica Poona. A three-compartment surface sanitization method consisting of washing with an antimicrobial soap solution, scrubbing with a brush in tap water, and immersion in 150 ppm of sodium hypochlorite reduced the initial level of recoverable viable bacteria by 99.8%. When examined separately, scrubbing with a vegetable brush in tap water, washing with soap, and dipping in chlorine were found to reduce the bacterial load by 70, 80, and 90%, respectively.", "label": 1}

When L. pneumophila colonizes an aquatic installation, it can persist for years despite repeated treatments with disinfectants. We hypothesized that freshwater amoebae play an important role in bacterial resistance to disinfectants, and in subsequent resuscitation of viable non-culturable (VNC) L. pneumophila that results in re-emergence of the disease-causing strain in the disinfected water source. Our work showed that in the absence of Acanthamoeba polyphaga, seven L. pneumophila strains became non-culturable after treatment by 256 p.p.m. of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). In contrast, intracellular L. pneumophila within A. polyphaga was resistant to 1024 p.p.m. of NaOCl. In addition, L. pneumophila-infected A. polyphaga exhibited increased resistance to NaOCl. When chlorine-sterilized water samples were co-cultured with A. polyphaga, the non-culturable L. pneumophila were resuscitated and proliferated robustly within A. polyphaga. Upon treatment by NaOCl, uninfected amoebae differentiated into cysts within 48 h. In contrast, L. pneumophila-infected A. polyphaga failed to differentiate into cysts, and L. pneumophila was never detected in cysts of A. polyphaga. We conclude that amoebic trophozoites protect intracellular L. pneumophila from eradication by NaOCl, and play an essential role in resuscitation of VNC L. pneumophila in NaOCl-disinfected water sources. Intracellular L. pneumophila within trophozoites of A. polyphaga block encystation of the amoebae, and the resistance of both organisms to NaOCl is enhanced. To ensure long-term eradication and complete loss of the VNC state of L. pneumophila, we recommend that Legionella-protozoa co-culture should be an important tool to ensure complete loss of the VNC state of L. pneumophila.", "label": 1}

Then, samples were packaged in 50 ?m polypropylene bags and stored at 5 \u00b0C for 12 days, followed by an evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of the treatments. Various quality and safety parameters, such as gas compn., color, off-odor, elec. cond. and microbial nos., were evaluated during storage. Results revealed insignificant differences in gas compn., and no off-odor was obsd. in any of the samples during the storage period.

Amongst the invasive treatments, botulinum toxin-A injections in submandibular and parotid glands and various surgical techniques are worth mentioning. There are no studies in Mexico on the usefulness of surgery to manage sialorrhoea. Objective To evaluate the usefulness of submandibular gland resection in improving sialorrhoea in patients with cerebral palsy and with a poor response to botulinum toxin. Material and methods Experimental, clinical, self-controlled, prospective trial was conducted to evaluate the grade of sialorrhoea before surgery, and 8, 16 and 24 weeks after. Statistical analysis was performed using a non-parametric repetitive measure assessment, considering a p &lt; 0.05 as significant. Complications and changes in salivary composition were evaluated. Results Surgery was performed on 3 patients with severe sialorrhoea, and 2 with profuse sialorrhoea, with mean age of 10.8 years. The frequency and severity of sialorrhoea improved in the 5 patients, with mean of 76.7 and 87.5% improvement, respectively. The best results were seen after 6 months of surgery, with a statistically significant difference between the preoperative stage and 6 months after the procedure (p = 0.0039, 95% CI). No significant differences were observed in complications, increase in periodontal disease or cavities, or salivary composition. Conclusions Submandibular gland resection is an effective technique for sialorrhoea control in paediatric patients with cerebral palsy, with a reduction in salivary flow greater than 80%. It has a low chance of producing complications compared to other techniques.

Despite technological break-through on the instrumental side, metabolite identification still requires tedious manual data inspection and interpretation of huge analytical datasets. The process of metabolite identification has become largely facilitated and partly automated by cheminformatics approaches such as knowledge base metabolite prediction using, for example, Meteor, MetaDrug, MetaSite and StarDrop that are typically applied pre-acquisition. Likewise, emerging new technologies in postacquisition data analysis like mass defect filtering (MDF) have moved the technology driven analytical methodology to metabolite identification toward generic, structure-based workflows. The biggest challenge for automation however remains the structural assignment of drug metabolites. Software-guided approaches for the unsupervised metabolite identification still cannot compete with expert user manual data interpretation yet. Recently MassMetaSite has been introduced for the automated ranked output of metabolite structures based on the combination of metabolite prediction and interrogation of analytical mass spectrometric data.

We found that adult rat cardiomyocytes accumulate vitamin C by transporting dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), the oxidized form of vitamin C, but do not transport ascorbic acid. Loading cells with vitamin C by DHA treatment resulted in resistance to hypoxia- and hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell death associated with the quenching of reactive oxygen species. When rats were injected with DHA before coronary occlusion, the ascorbic acid content in the heart was six to eight times higher than in untreated controls and myocardial infarction was reduced by 62%. DHA also provided significant protection when administered intravenously 2 h after coronary occlusion. In cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation, DHA treatment resulted in decreased apoptosis associated with inhibition of Bax expression, caspase-3 activation, and cytochrome c translocation into the cytoplasm.

Greywater irrigation of food crops is widely practised but its effects on African leafy vegetables (ALVs), which hold potential for cultivation to improve food security, are unknown. This study investigated the effects of synthetic greywater irrigation on germination in three ALVs, viz., Amaranthus dubius, Cleome gynandra and Solanum nigrum, and subsequent seedling growth in A. dubius and S. nigrum. Seeds and seedlings were treated with chlorinated and dechlorinated greywater and tap water, supplemented with nutrients. Greywater application decreased germination capacity (by 23-25%) when assessed in Petri dishes in A. dubius only. However, greywater application was less harmful to A. dubius seeds sown in soil. Vigour was compromised in greywater-treated seeds of all three species but greywater can be used to irrigate freshly-sown seeds of A. dubius without reducing percentage seedling production. However, greywater irrigation reduced capacity (by 21-23%) and rate of shoot emergence in S. nigrum, and growth and chlorophyll content in both species. These negative effects were accompanied by increased soil electrical conductivity (after 21 d) and pH (after 14 d). The reduced growth under greywater irrigation was most likely based on a reduction in light-harvesting capacity and/or nutrient availability. Overall, S. nigrum seedlings were significantly more sensitive to the negative effects of greywater, possibly due to increased transpirational water loss under greywater irrigation. The effects of greywater were largely independent of chlorine content. Applying greywater in excess of plant requirements and/ or alternating greywater irrigation events with freshwater watering events could promote leaching of salts found in greywater. The effects of greywater irrigation on soil water and nutrient availability demand further investigation for ALVs.", "label": 0}

Evaluations included Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) oocyst inactivation, disinfection byproduct formation, and distribution system impacts. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}
{"id": "289", "title": "Antimicrobial activity of controlled-release chlorine dioxide gas on fresh blueberries", "abstract": "The effect of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas on the safety and quality of blueberries was studied. In vitro studies revealed that both ClO2 gas fumigation and ClO2 direct contact in water killed food pathogen bacterium Escherichia coli and fruit decay pathogen fungus Colletotrichum acutatum. In vivo studies were conducted using noninoculated berries and berries inoculated with postharvest decay and foodborne pathogens. Berries were inoculated with either E. coli (5.2 log CFU/g) or C. acutatum (3.9 log CFU/g). Inoculated fruit were dried for 2 h at room temperature in a climate-controlled laboratory and packed in perforated commercial clamshells, with or without ClO2 pads, and stored at 10 degrees C for up to 9 days. The effects of ClO2 on microbial populations and fruit firmness were monitored during storage. In the inoculation experiment, treatment with ClO2 reduced populations of E. coli and C. acutatum by 2.2 to 3.3 and 1.3 to 2.0 log CFU/g, respectively. For the noninoculated blueberries, the initial total aerobic bacteria count and the yeast and mold count were 4.2 and 4.1 log CFU/g, respectively. ClO2 treatment reduced total aerobic bacteria count and yeast and mold count by 1.5 to 1.8 and 1.3 to 1.7 log CFU/g, respectively. The firmness of both inoculated and noninoculated blueberries was maintained by ClO2 treatment. Thus, controlled-release ClO2 gas fumigation technology shows promise as an effective and practical antimicrobial agent in commercial clamshell packaging of blueberry and other fruits.", "label": 0}

The investigations evaluated the efficacy of these formulations against amoebic cysts and trophozoites. METHODS AND RESULTS: Laboratory challenges against protozoa isolated from cooling towers using chlorine, bromine and isothiazolinone biocides showed that all were effective after 4 h. The presence of molybdate and organic phosphates resulted in longer kill times for bromine and isothiazolinones. All treatments resulted in no detectable viable protozoa after 4 h of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The chemical disinfection of planktonic protozoa in cooling water systems is strongly influenced by the residence time of the formulation and less so by its active constituent. Bromine and isothiazolinone formulations may require higher dosage of concentrations than currently practiced if used in conjunction with molybdate- and phosphate-based scale/corrosion inhibitors. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Cooling water systems are complex microbial ecosystems in which predator-prey relationships play a key role in the dissemination of Legionella. This study demonstrated that at recommended dosing concentrations, biocides had species-specific effects on environmental isolates of amoebae that may act as reservoirs for Legionella multiplication in cooling water systems.", "label": 0}

Modern sachet production lines are prone to the development of biofilms, and traditional microbiological indicators of fecal water contamination may not capture all the potential risks to human health in such a widely-consumed product. This study tested a sample of 80 sachets purchased along two commercial transects in low-income neighborhoods of Accra, Ghana, for total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), Escherichia coli (EC), total heterotrophic bacteria (THB), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), and examined the relationships between these indicators and brand reputation. Just 5% of samples tested positive for TC, and none tested positive for FC and EC, yet 41% of samples tested positive for PA. After controlling for one popular brand, a negative brand reputation was associated with both THB presence (P\u00a0=\u00a00.015) and the number of samples with THB\u00a0&gt;\u00a0500\u00a0CFU/mL (P\u00a0=\u00a00.038), but PA was found in brands of both positive and negative reputations, and was only correlated with THB counts.

{"id": "2921", "title": "Inactivation Mechanism of Escherichia coli Induced by Slightly Acidic Electrolyzed Water", "abstract": "Foodborne disease outbreak caused by food microbiological contamination is a serious public health problem. Slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW), a new ultra-high effect and wide-spectrum disinfectant that is colourless, odourless, and harmless to humans and the environment, is directly used on food surfaces in Japan and America. However, the underlying inactivation mechanism remains unknown. In this study, biochemical and cellular changes were observed to investigate the bactericidal mechanism of SAEW against Escherichia coli (E. coli). The results indicated that SAEW with a pH of 6.40, an oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) of 910 mV, an available chlorine concentration (ACC) of 60 mg/L, and a volume ratio of 20:1, produced the most effective sterilization action. A fluorescence-based live-dead assay was further used to demonstrate the sterilized effect and the cell esterase activity damage caused by SAEW. During the observation period, within 10 min, the cell morphology changed, which was characterized by cell expansion, cell elongation and increased membrane permeability. Meanwhile, reactive oxygen substances (ROS) were released in the bacterial cells. E. coli inactivation and apoptosis induced by SAEW were observed. Our findings illustrate that the bactericidal effects of SAEW against E. coli occurred through cellular and biochemical mechanisms of cell necrosis and apoptosis.", "label": 1}
{"id": "8455", "title": "UV inactivation and resistance of rotavirus evaluated by integrated cell culture and real-time RT-PCR assay", "abstract": "Rotaviruses are double-stranded RNA viruses which are among the most resistant water-borne enteric viruses to UV disinfection. An integrated cell culture and real-time RT-PCR (ICC real-time RT-PCR) assay was developed to detect the infectivity of rotaviruses in water, which uses real-time RT-PCR to detect RNA produced by infectious rotaviruses during replication in host cells. Detection of rotaviral RNA in host cells provides direct evidence of the presence of infectious rotavirus rather than just the presence of rotavirus RNA. Using this newly developed method the inactivation and resistance of rotavirus to UV treatments at various doses was evaluated. With an initial concentration of 2 x 10(4) PFU/ml simian rotavirus (SA11), a first-order linear relationship was obtained at UV dose range of 0-120 mJ cm(-2), and the inactivation rate constant was estimated to be 0.0343 cm(2) mJ(-1) (R(2) = 0.966). The dose-inactivation curve tailed off and reached plateau as the UV dose increased from 120 to 360 mJcm(-2), indicating resistance phenomena of sub-populations of SA11 at very high UV doses. A maximal reduction of 4.8 log(10) was observed. Through parallel comparison with traditional culture assay, the ICC real-time RT-PCR method demonstrated more effective, sensitive and faster infectivity detection of rotavirus and, the results reveal that rotaviruses are more resistant to UV irradiation than previously reported with traditional cell culture assays.

The formation of THMs and HAAs are impacted by total org. carbon, bromide, pH, temp., chlorine dose, and contact time. As the elevation of Lake Mead continues to decrease due to drought, these water quality parameters will result in changes more conducive to forming THMs and HAAs potentially near the MCL. The current regulations coupled with water quality changes have prompted the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) to investigate various strategies to reduce THM and HAA concns. Bench scale expts. were performed to identify ways to optimize the current treatment plant performance without a major capital improvement. Results showed ozonization reduced THM concns. 4-7% at a 1.0-log Cryptosporidium inactivation, and 7-17% at a 2.0-log Cryptosporidium inactivation. Biol. filtration did not provide any substantial THM (<5%) or HAA (<10%) redn. Rechlorination results lowered THM concn. by 10-15% when a 1.8 mg/L free chlorine residual was rechlorinated with 0.7 mg/L Cl2 after 48 h, compared to an initial free chlorine residual of 2.5 mg/L. A temp. increase from 16.7\u00b0C to 23.7\u00b0C increased the chlorine decay rate 30-40% and increased THM formation by 30%. These bench scale results provide SNWA alternatives to continue compliance with the Stage 1 DBP Rule and proposed Stage 2 DBP rule without requiring a major capital improvement.

Ceramic tiles were inoculated with the test organisms and, once dried, were subjected to Sterilox fogging using a stationary vaporizing machine sited at a distance of 3 m for 10 min and then left for a further hour. In a second experiment using the same organisms, the first 10-min fogging period was followed by a directed fogging period of 30 s at a distance of 1 m. Organisms were cultured from the tiles, plated on to tryptone soya agar and incubated for 48 h. Initial counts of approximately 109 colony-forming units/mL for both organisms were reduced approximately 104 fold for MRSA and 105.8 fold for A. baumannii when using a single fogging. The second fogging resulted in 106.8-fold reductions for both organisms. Sterilox fog is safe and simple to use, and can reduce levels of nosocomial pathogens by a factor of almost 107. It is worthy of clinical evaluation in clinical settings to determine whether it maintains its microbicidal effects against a variety of organisms on different surfaces.", "label": 0}

All treatment combinations involving chlorine and/or lactic acid reduced carcass contamination. The reductions in mean log(10) CFU/cm(2) for carcass aerobic plate count (APC) data ranged from 0.4 to 1.8. The treatment combination using lactic acid at both spray times (Let) resulted in the greatest reduction. Additionally, treatment combinations involving lactic acid at either time and in combination with water or chlorine tended to reduce APCs more than those treatment combinations without acid. Browning of blood splashes was observed on carcasses sprayed with lactic acid and persisted until fabrication at 72 h postmortem. A companion study was designed, in conjunction with the carcass decontamination study, to evaluate effect of carcass treatment on the microbiological quality of subprimal subdivisions derived from treated carcasses. A facet of the subprimal study evaluated chlorine spray (200 ppm) and microwave radiation as approaches to improving subprimal shelf life and safety. Cuts taken from sprayed carcasses were vacuum packaged with or without intervention treatments, stored at 1 to 2 degrees C and evaluated for both APC and pathogen populations at specified intervals of up to 120 days. These results demonstrated that neither carcass nor intervention treatment had any significant (P > 0.05), beneficial effect on the microbiological quality of subprimal cuts.", "label": 1}

Different concentrations of iodine (from 1.0 to 10 mg/l) were employed to inactivate E. coli in these samples at three pHs (6.0, 7.5 and 9.0) and three temperatures (5, 20 and 35\u00b0C). The results obtained were compared with those of an arbitrarily selected standard of 1.0 mg/l chlorine. Under all the conditions, for which dosages of 3.0 mg/l iodine were used in the samples containing stream sediments, a water with virtually no E. coli was obtained within a 30 min contact time. For the samples containing digested sludge, a dosage of 8.0 mg/l iodine was required to achieve the same quality water, whereas for the samples containing raw sludge, a dosage of 10 mg/l was only sufficient at the lowest investigated turbidities (5-7 NTU). Disinfectant capabilities of both iodine and chlorine declined with increasing temperature, pH and turbidity. The efficiency of 1.0 mg/l chlorine was slightly better than that of iodine in the samples containing stream sediments, but in the samples containing digested sludge and raw sludge the efficiency of iodine was to be found better than that of the chlorine especially at the higher temperature and pH values. Correlations were obtained between percentage removal of E. coli, the amount of disinfectant employed, the temperature and the quality of the water represented by pH and total oxidized carbon level.", "label": 1}

Changes in pathogen population, COD, pH, temperature, redox potential, and free and total chlorine were monitored in process wash water during treatments. Considering the specific characteristics of the washing step included in the fresh-cut processing, the disinfection of process wash water should be of fast action. A biphasic with a shoulder model was used to estimate shoulder length (Sl), log-linear inactivation rates (kmax1, kmax2), lowest population (Nf) and highest log reduction (HLR). Current density clearly influenced Sl, and kmax2; recirculation flow rate influenced Sl, kmax1, kmax2 and COD depletion; and doping level influenced Nf. No relationship was observed between inactivation parameters and chlorine concentration. Conditions including high current density (180 mA/cm2), high flow rate (750 l/h) and high doping level (8 000 ?mol/mol) seems to provide a disinfection efficiency suitable to decrease the chance of bacterial cross contamination in the fresh-cut industries while saving on water consumption and decreasing the amount of wastewater effluents.", "label": 1}

Bactericidal behaviour of the products on bacterial strain was tested by selecting Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) as model pathogenic bacteria. Antibacterial assessment, including the plate counting technique, zone of inhibition study, and antibacterial kinetic test, demonstrated that amine N-halamine microspheres exerted powerful bactericidal capability. Effects of the contacting period, particle size, and oxidative chlorine content on antimicrobial activity were also established.

Abstr.: Amines and biofertilizers play an important role in a plant's response to adverse environmental conditions including salt and osmotic stress. This study investigates the integration effect of putrescine amine (Put), biofertilizers, and mycorrhizae (My) on the date palm zaghloul genotype irrigated by saline water and grown in reclaimed saline soil. The data collected indicates that selected plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, in the presence of Put, enables the date palm zaghloul genotype to increase its tolerance and adapt to stress conditions in the reclaimed saline soil. Overall, treatments reduced salt-induced oxidative damage in the date palm, resulting in increased productivity and improved fruit quality. The results obsd. may be a consequence of the increase in photosynthetic pigments, activities of antioxidant enzymes, org. solutes and/or promoting growth substances such as gibberellic acid (GA3), auxins (IAA) and cytokinin. Moreover, a decrease in the levels of lipid peroxidn. and inhibitor substances such as abscisic acid (ABA) may be related. The most effective interaction treatments were seen at 2.5 mM Put due to an increase in the activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) while a decrease in lipid peroxidn. was noticed. The combination of Put with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) at a 5 mM concn. as biofertilizer increased diamine oxidase (DAO) and polyamine oxidase (PAO) activities when compared to the other treatments. The activity of these two enzymes can produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which may act in structural defense as a signal mol. and decrease the prodn. of polyamines against salt-induced oxidative damage in date palm.

The leaves that were analyzed were collected from trees with and without signs of damage that were all growing in the same salt stress conditions. The reason for undertaking these investigations was the observations over many years that indicated that there are trees that present a healthy appearance and trees that have visible symptoms of decay in the same habitat. Leaf samples were collected from trees growing in the median strip between roadways that have been intensively salted during the winter season for many years. The sodium content was determined using atomic spectrophotometry, chloride using potentiometric titration and poly-isoprenoids using HPLC/ UV. AGPs and pectins were determined using immunohistochemistry methods. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that rhamnogalacturonans I (RG-I) and homogalacturonans were differentially distributed in leaves from healthy trees in contrast to leaves from injured trees. In the case of AGPs, the most visible difference was the presence of the JIM16 epitope. Chemical analyses of sodium and chloride showed that in the leaves from injured trees, the level of these ions was higher than in the leaves from healthy trees. Based on chromatographic analysis, four polyisoprenoid alcohols were identified in the leaves of T. x euchlora. The levels of these lipids were higher in the leaves from healthy trees. The results suggest that the differences that were detected in the apoplast and symplasm may be part of the defensive strategy of T. x euchlora trees to salt stress, which rely on changes in the chemical composition of the cell wall with respect to the pectic and AGP epitopes and an increased synthesis of prenyl lipids.", "label": 0}

A major element of the EPA (US EPA) strategy for controlling C. parvum (oocysts) in drinking water is the possible use of Ct (concentration of disinfectant in mg/L times time in minutes) values. To support this strategy a Ct equation, based on first-order kinetics, is proposed to provide guidance to drinking water utilities for the application of chlorine dioxide for controlling C. parvum oocysts. The equation is based on standard statistical techniques using available bench scale data. It can predict mean inactivation levels as well as a statistically conservative upper bound Ct value. This upper bound could be used to insure an appropriate safety factor for the protection of public health.", "label": 0}

The populations of total aerobic bacteria, yeast and mould, and coliform decreased with increasing aqueous ClO2 and fumaric acid concentrations and increasing UV-C irradiation dose. However, the increase in the UV-C irradiation dose had a negative effect on the sensory quality. Therefore, the optimal combined treatment condition of 100ppm aqueous ClO2, 0.31% fumaric acid and 1.9 kJm(-2) UV-C was selected for the buckwheat sprouts by providing reductions of 3.9, 1.8 and 2.4 log CFUg(-1) on the populations of total aerobic bacteria, yeast and mould, and coliform, respectively. The combined treatment also maintained an acceptable sensory quality. These results suggest that the optimised combined treatment can be used as a microbial inactivation method for buckwheat sprouts.", "label": 0}

There is a great need to revalidate the effectiveness of the intervention strategies commonly used in food processing environments for multidrug-resistant strains. The purpose of this study was to det. the survival of antibiotic-resistant O26 and O103 Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains to lactic acid (2.5, 3.5, 5%), sodium hypochlorite (0.2, 0.5, 1 ppm free chlorine), and heat (60, 61, 62.5 \u00b0C) treatments. Six strains from STEC serotypes O26 and O103 with three distinctive antibiotic-resistant profiles (susceptible, low and high resistance) were selected for the study. As expected, the rates of inactivation were faster at increasing biocide concns. or temp. level. The Weibull model provided a better fit than the traditional log-linear model due to the appearance of nonlinear patterns. A 5% lactic acid treatment for 10 min reduced the population of all STEC strains by 5 log CFU/mL. Sodium hypochlorite treatment (1 ppm for 5 min) achieved a similar redn. Thermal D values for O26 and O103 serotypes ranged from 0.37 to 2.09 and 0.37-1.71 min, resp. No statistical differences (P > 0.05) in tolerance were found between the two STEC serotypes to the different treatments. The antibiotic profile was not related to the ability to tolerate any of the treatments. Only the susceptible strain showed a relative higher resistance to the lactic acid and lower resistance to sodium hypochlorite treatment. These results would contribute to assess the risk for the presence of STEC strains in food processing environments. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}

Approximately 900,000 teenagers become pregnant each year. Research indicates that these pregnancies often limit future educational and economic opportunities for mother, father, and child. Sexually transmitted infections also pose a major threat to adolescents. For example, during a 3-year study of sexually active women at a major university, 60% were infected with human papillomavirus. Research indicates that adolescents, especially female ones, are physically more susceptible to sexually transmitted infections than adults. There have been a number of attempts by the medical and public health communities to confront these problems. In fact, the most popular strategy of the past 15 years has relied on increasing contraceptive use. For reduction of sexually transmitted infections, this approach depends on condoms, and for reduction of pregnancy, on oral contraceptives. The problem with condom-based approaches, however, is that physicians are often unaware of the limitations in the protection provided by condoms from sexually transmitted infections. For example, condoms offer inadequate protection from 3 of the most common sexually transmitted infections\u2014human papillomavirus, type 2 herpesvirus, and chlamydia. By helping adolescents delay their sexual debut, we can offer hope to the greatest number of teens. Physicians can take the lead in emphasizing this approach both with their patients and in their medical organizations. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:334-9.)", "label": 0}

The greatest synergism was observed when chlorine dioxide was used as a primary disinfectant followed by secondary disinfection with free chlorine. A lesser synergistic effect was observed when ozone was used as the primary disinfectant, but no synergism was observed when UV was used as the primary disinfectant. When free chlorine was used as the primary disinfectant (i.e., sequential application in the reverse order), the synergistic effect was shown only when chlorine dioxide was applied as the secondary disinfectant. The synergistic effect observed could be related to damage to the spore coat during primary disinfection, suggested by the loss of proteins from spores during disinfectant treatment. The greatest synergism observed by the chlorine dioxide/free chlorine pair suggested that common reaction sites might exist for these disinfectants. The concept of percent synergistic effect was introduced to quantitatively compare the extent of synergistic effects in the sequential disinfection processes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The first cases were recognized in 1973, but the disease remained very rare until the 1980s, when an increase in incidence mainly associated with contact lens wear was reported. There is an increased risk when contact lens rinsing and soaking solutions are prepared with nonsterile water and salt tablets. The clinical picture is often characterized by severe pain with an early superficial keratitis that is often treated as herpes simplex infection. Subsequently a characteristic radial perineural infiltration may be seen, and ring infiltration is common. Limbitis and scleritis are frequent. Laboratory diagnosis is primarily by culture of epithelial samples inoculated onto agar plates spread with bacteria. Direct microscopy of samples using stains for the cyst wall or immunostaining may also be employed. A variety of topically applied therapeutic agents are thought to be effective, including propamidine isethionate, clotrimazole, polyhexamethylene biguanide, and chlorhexidine. Various combinations of these and other agents have been employed, often resulting in medical cure, especially if treatment is commenced early in the course of the disease.

Genetic improvement of salt tolerance is essential for sustainable soybean prodn. in saline areas. In this study, we isolated a gene (Ncl) that could synchronously regulate the transport and accumulation of Na+, K+, and Cl- from a Brazilian soybean cultivar FT-Abyara using map-based cloning strategy. Higher expression of the salt tolerance gene Ncl in the root resulted in lower accumulations of Na+, K+, and Cl- in the shoot under salt stress. Transfer of Ncl with the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method into a soybean cultivar Kariyutaka significantly enhanced its salt tolerance. Introgression of the tolerance allele into soybean cultivar Jackson, using DNA marker-assisted selection (MAS), produced an improved salt tolerance line. Ncl could increase soybean grain yield by 3.6-5.5 times in saline field conditions.

In vitro exposure of mouse, rat and human blood cells to ClO2 and the reduction by-product, chlorite (ClO2-) resulted in the formation of methemoglobin, a decrease in the activities of glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and in the content of reduced glutathione (GSH), and an increase in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) formation and hemolysis. The H2O2 formation and hemolysis induced by ClO2 and ClO2- in mouse blood cells were the highest among cells tested, and human blood cells were more resistant to the oxidative stress than rat and mouse blood cells. Both compounds also showed more toxic responses to E. coli mutants lacking production of catalase DSH19 (katEG), superoxide dismutase DSH56 (sodAB) and both of them DSH67 (katEG sodAB) than the wild strain DSH7 by Kat-sod assay, as a biological detection method for reactive oxygen species, suggesting the production of H2O2 and superoxide anion. For subchronic study of ClO2, mice received drinking water containing 100, 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg/l ClO2 in the presence of the stabilizer, 1200 mg/l of sodium bicarbonate ad libitum for 30, 60 or 90 days. Statistically significant hematological changes were observed in animals exposed to more than 1000 mg/l ClO2, which showed augmented G-6-PD activity in erythrocytes and increased resistance to hemolysis in hypotonic solution. The results of this study therefore indicate that ClO2 acutely causes hematotoxicity toward mice by producing reactive oxygen species and by weakening the protection systems to oxidative stress in erythrocytes, although the latter may be induced by long term exposure, while humans appear to be more resistant to this hematotoxicity.", "label": 0}

The dosages required to achieve varying levels of Giardia and Cryptosporidium inactivation based on CT values were examd., as well as the subsequent byproduct concns. Typically 1.5 to 2 mg/L of applied chlorine dioxide was capable of 3-log Giardia inactivation at 1\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C, and at both pH 6 and 9. Chlorine dioxide dosages of up to 3 mg/L were required to achieve 0.5-log Cryptosporidium inactivation using a simple CT model developed for this study on the basis of published inactivation data. Greater chlorine dioxide dosages were typically required at 1\u00b0C compared to 25\u00b0C, and at pH 9 when compared to pH 6, to provide the same level of microbial inactivation.

The effects of growth temperature, growth rate, and growth mode (suspended growth versus growth in biofilms) on inactivation kinetics of Escherichia coli exposed to monochloramine were studied in order to understand growth conditions that may reduce susceptibility of bacteria to disinfectants in DWDS. Cells grown at a suboptimal temperature (20 degrees C) were significantly less sensitive to monochloramine inactivation (using 0.5 and 5.0 mg/L monochloramine (as Cl-2)) than cells grown at an optimal temperature (37 degrees C). Cells grown in biofilms were also significantly less sensitive than cells grown in suspension. No difference in inactivation kinetics was observed for cells grown in monolayer versus multilayer biofilms and between cells grown at different growth rates in chemostat bioreactors. Biofilm cells were estimated to grow at specific growth rates (mu) averaging between mu = 0.08 and 0.13 h(-1), which were approximately within the range of tested suspended growth conditions (mu = 0.04-0.10 h(-1)) using fluorescence in situ hybridizations targeting 16S rRNA. This result indicates that the reduced susceptibility of biofilm cells to monochloramine inactivation is not related to their specific growth rate within the range tested in this study. This work suggests that growth at suboptimal temperatures and growth in biofilms are important factors contributing to reduced susceptibility of bacteria to inactivation with monochloramine.", "label": 0}

This study also evaluated the efficiency of combined PAA/ultraviolet irradiation (UV) and H2O2/UV treatments to determine if the microbial inactivation was synergistic. Microbial cultures were added into a synthetic wastewater-like test medium and treated by chemical disinfectants with a 10 min contact time, UV irradiation or the combination of chemical and UV treatments. A peracetic acid dose of 3 mg/l resulted in approximately 2-3 log enteric bacterial reductions, whereas 7-15 mg/l PAA was needed to achieve 1-1.5 log coliphage MS2 reductions. Doses of 3-150 mg/l hydrogen peroxide achieved below 0.2 log microbial reductions. Sodium hypochlorite treatments caused 0.3-1 log microbial reductions at an 18 mg/l chlorine dose, while 2.6 log reductions of E. faecalis were achieved at a 12 mg/l chlorine dose. The results indicate that PAA could represent a good alternative to chlorine compounds in disinfection procedures, especially in wastewaters containing easily oxidizable organic matter. Hydrogen peroxide is not an efficient disinfectant against enteric microorganisms in wastewaters. The combined PAA/UV disinfection showed increased disinfection efficiency and synergistic benefits with all the enteric bacteria tested but lower synergies for the coliphage MS2. This suggests that this method could improve the efficiency and reliability of disinfection in wastewater treatment plants.

In this study, the implicated alfalfa seed lot (no. 8,119) was confirmed to be contaminated with Salmonella Mbandaka at a detection frequency of approximately 72% per replicated 100 g of seed. The sensitivity of detection was improved by a combination of nonselective and selective enrichment of 5.0 ml of germination effluent, followed by immunomagnetic separation. Detection of low levels of viable cells with nonselective enrichment, employed to enhance the recovery of stressed or injured cells, was facilitated by the application of Salmonella-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). With PCR assays, Salmonella Mbandaka was detectable on seed stored at 5 degrees C for at least 11 months, but at an increasingly diminishing frequency. Using conventional techniques, viable populations were detected in the seed germination effluent from seeds stored for up to 8 months. Seed treatments with buffered (to pH 7) and unbuffered solutions of calcium hypochlorite, providing approximately 2,000 and 20,000 ppm of free chlorine, for 10 min were equally effective in eliminating viable populations of Salmonella Mbandaka.

Two virulence plasmid-bearing strains. A. Y. enterocolitica W1024 0:9--a reference strain--and B. Y. enterocolitica B1 0:5 Lis Xz--a strain isolated from food in San Luis, Argentina, were assayed. Counts of both strains at 6 degrees C did not present significant changes during the first 4 days, but increased until day 15. Both strains were able to grow on tomatoes stored at 22 degrees C and 35 degrees C. At 22 degrees C maximum values were obtained on days 3 and 4, with a subsequent significant decrease. Highest counts were obtained at 37 degrees C. No detectable levels of viable cells were observed by using 500 ppm free chlorine washing solution. Non-inoculated tomatoes were analyzed for Y. enterocolitica with negative results. Zero tolerance for pathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains has been recommended for ready-to-use vegetables. Therefore, sanitary measures should be taken in the manipulation and storage of fresh tomatoes.", "label": 1}

In this work we investigated the effect of low concentrations of 0.2, 1 and 5 mu g/ml of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (2,4,5-TCP), pentachlorophenol (PCP), 4,6-dichloroguaiacol (4,6-DCG), tetrachloroguaiacol (TeCG), 4,5-dichlorocatechol (4,5-DCC) and tetrachlorocatechol (TeCC) on DNA bases oxidation in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The analysis was performed using alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (the comet assay). To detect oxidized pyrimidynes and purines we used the repair enzymes such as endonuclease III and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase. DNA oxidation was expressed as a percentage of comet tail, which was formed after the xenobiotics treatment. The obtained results showed that all the compounds examined were able to oxidize DNA bases in human lymphocytes. It was also observed that pyrimidine bases were more strongly oxidized in comparison to purine ones. Finally, it was found that chlorinated catechols and TeCC in particular, revealed a higher oxidative potential in comparison to chlorophenols and chloroguaiacols, and a rise in the number of chlorine atoms in the compound from each group examined led to an increase in DNA bases damage.

However, fresh produce has contributed to many outbreaks of Listeria monocytogenes, which can form a mature biofilm within 24 h. Recent control strategies have proved ineffective in ensuring safe food prodn. This study focuses on L. monocytogenes biofilms formed on lettuces and cabbages using a viable plate count method and field emission electron microscopy. We investigated the redn. efficacy of treatment with 200 ppm (ppm) chlorine, 2% each of citric, lactic, and malic acids, 32 Hz ultrasonication (US), 390 mJ/cm2 UV-C (UV-C), or 750 mJ/cm2 cold oxygen plasma (COP) on L. monocytogenes biofilms. Following treatment, the quality of the vegetables was analyzed with std. procedures. UV-C and COP showed the best CFU redn., regardless of the nature of the vegetable surface, while US failed to produce any significant redn. (P > 0.05). Furthermore, chem. treatments reduced count by < 1 log colony forming unit (CFU)/cm2 on lettuces, whereas a > 2 log redn. was obsd. on cabbages. The effect of chem. treatment largely depended on the particular vegetable, while UV-C and COP achieved high redn. regardless of the vegetable, and had no effect on quality. We, therefore, speculate that UV-C and COP show promise in overcoming L. monocytogenes biofilms on food produce. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}

L. monocytogenes is ubiquitous in nature and has the ability to persist in food processing environments for extended periods of time by forming biofilms and resisting industrial sanitization. Human listeriosis outbreaks are commonly linked to contaminated dairy products, ready-to-eat meats and in recent years, fresh produce such as lettuce and cantaloupes. We identified a putative Crp/Fnr family transcription factor Lmo0753 that is highly specific to human-assocd. genetic lineages of L. monocytogenes. Lmo0753 possesses two conserved functional domains similar to the major virulence regulator PrfA in L. monocytogenes. To det. if Lmo0753 is involved in environmental persistence-related mechanisms, we compared Lmo0753 deletion mutants with resp. wild type and complementation mutants of two fully sequenced L. monocytogenes genetic lineage II strains 10403S and EGDe for the relative ability of growth under different nutrient availability and temps., soil survival, biofilm productivity and attachment to select fresh produce surfaces including romaine lettuce leaves and cantaloupe rinds. Our results collectively suggested that Lmo0753 plays an important role in L. monocytogenes biofilm prodn. and attachment to fresh produce, which may contribute to the environmental persistence and recent emergence of this pathogen in human listeriosis outbreaks linked to fresh produce.

Hg(0) by mercury-resistant bacteria was used to remove mercury from wastewater of a chlor-alkali electrolysis plant. The development of a microbial demercurization process for wastewater from chlor-alkali electrolysis using the amalgam route requires biomass. The demercurization process essentially consists of a pretreatment step for pH adjustment and a fixed-bed bioreactor with pumice granules as a carrier for the immobilized mercury-resistant bacteria, followed by an activated carbon. The microorganism performing the desired biotransformation must be stably and stationarily fixed in the reactor by immobilization or growth on a suitable support matrix, such as Siran, wood, and cellulose compds. The wastewater treatment plant was on stream for eight months at ECI Ibbenbueren, Germany, and is currently in operation at the chlor-alkali electrolysis factory of Spolchemie in the Czech Republic.

The HNMs are structurally similar to halomethanes, but have a nitro-group in place of hydrogen bonded to the central carbon atom. Since little information exists on the genotoxic potential of HNMs, a study has been carried out with two HNM compounds, namely trichloronitromethane (TCNM) and bromonitromethane (BNM) by using human cells. Primary damage induction has been measured with the Comet assay, which is used to determine both the repair kinetics of the induced damage and the proportion of induced oxidative damage. In addition, the fixed DNA damage has been evaluated by using the micronucleus (MN) assay. The results obtained indicate that both compounds are genotoxic, inducing high levels of DNA breaks in the Comet assay, and that this DNA damage repairs well over time. In addition, oxidized bases constitute a high proportion of DNA-induced damage (50-75%). Contrarily, no positive effects were observed in the frequency of micronucleus, which measures both clastogenic and aneugenic effects, neither using TK6 cells nor peripheral blood lymphocytes. This lack of fixed genetic damage would minimize the potential mutagenic risk associated with HNMs exposure. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.", "label": 0}

The purpose of this study was optimizing a new antiseptic formulation specifically targeted at intact skin disinfection and evaluating its in vitro microbicidal activity and in vivo efficacy. Methods: The biocidal properties of the antiseptic solution containing 0.5% chloramine-T diluted in 50% isopropyl alcohol (Cloral; Eurospital SpA Trieste, Italy) were measured in vitro versus gram-positive-, gram-negative-, and acid-alcohol-resistant germs and fungi with standard suspension tests in the presence of fetal bovine serum. Virus-inhibiting activity was evaluated in vitro against human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, poliovirus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. Tests used different methods for the different biologic and in vitro replication capacity of these human viruses. Lastly, Cloral tolerability and skin colonization retardation efficacy after disinfection were studied in vivo. Results: The antiseptic under review showed fast and sustained antimicrobial activity. The efficacy of Cloral against clinically important bacterial and viral pathogens and fungi was highlighted under the experimental conditions described in this article. Finally, microbial regrowth lag and no side effects were documented in vivo after disinfection of 11 volunteers.

Relative mutagenicity was studied with and without S9 activation in Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100, as well as in the nitroreductase deficient strains TA98/NR and TA100/NR. Chromosomal aberrations in the bone-marrow cells of mice following intraperitoneal administration of the nitrostilbenes were observed as an indicator of in vivo genotoxicity. All of the compounds were active in TA98 and TA100 without S9 activation, with the exception of 4-amino-4'-nitrostilbene in TA100. Mutagenic activity was greatly reduced or eliminated in the NR strains, which is consistent with metabolic activation of the compounds by bacterial reductase. The presence of S9 lowered the activity of most of the nitrostilbenes presumedly by enzymatic detoxication. Hammet values of substituents, partition coefficients and frontier orbital energies (ELUMO and EHOMO) were studied for correlations with mutagenicity of the eleven E-stilbenes. Correlations could be established between mutagenicity in TA98 without S9 activation and the Hammet values. The same mutagenicity could also be correlated to ELUMO. Rationales for these correlations include the concept that electron-withdrawing groups which lower ELUMO should facilitate the reduction of the nitro group, leading to the proximate mutagen hydroxylamine. The correlations are also explained by the concept that electron-withdrawing groups should help stabilize the hydroxylamine intermediate and make the ultimate mutagenic species, the nitrenium ions, more reactive toward DNA. The relationship between mutagenicity and electronic effects of substituent groups found in vitro could not be extended to the in vivo results. However, except for the dinitrostilbenes, where insolubility prevented their testing, all the nitrostilbenes produced a statistically significant increase in chromosomal aberrations compared to the negative solvent control.

To reduce the risk of toxicity to dental patients when water coolants are used, numerous chemical agents have been tested. In a series of trials, the authors investigated the recurrence of microbial growth after treating DUWLs with sodium hypochlorite (bleach), or B; glutaraldehyde, or G; or isopropanol 15.3 percent, or I. Methods The authors excised tubing sections from dental units in a general clinic. The tubing sections were evaluated at baseline and after overnight treatment. Effluent water samples and biofilm samples from tubing sections also were evaluated, by culture, at baseline and after treatment with the chemical agents. Biofilm within the tubing was examined by scanning electron microscopy, or SEM, and the authors identified bacterial isolates using standard techniques. The authors performed minimum inhibitory concentration tests on identified isolates pre- and posttreatment and compared the results to determine possible differences in resistance. Results In baseline evaluations, the authors determined that the effluent and biofilm matrix harbored an average of 1 \u00d7 105 colony-forming units, or CFU, per square centimeter and 1 \u00d7 104 CFU/cm2 recoverable mi-croorganisms, respectively. A single overnight treatment of the DUWLs with B, G or I rendered effluent and biofilm samples that were free of recoverable bacteria. The number of viable bacteria in the effluent and the biofilm of B- or I-treated DUWLs returned to pre-treatment levels by day six and day 15, respectively. DUWLs treated with G showed evidence of bacterial recurrence in the effluent and the biofilm to pretreatment levels by day three. The authors compared recurrence of biofilm and effluent posttreatment with untreated control tubing. The lower recurrence of viable bacteria in both biofilm and effluent samples for tubing treated with B and I was significant (P &lt; .05). No evidence of resistance to the agents was noted during the study. Multiple treatments held the bacterial population to below recoverable levels but failed to remove the biofilm matrix, as evidenced by SEM. Conclusion B, G and I eliminated recoverable bacteria after treatment and inhibited their recurrence in DUWL. Recolonization rates varied by agent. Clinical Implications The residual effect of these agents raises concerns about the slow release of potentially toxic substances from the residual biofilm matrix. These agents reduce microorganisms in effluent water but do little to destroy the biofilm matrix in the DUWL, even with periodic treatments. Bacterial populations in the dental unit water rapidly recolonize the DUWL. Chemical agents or agents that potentially could be trapped in the matrix can represent an additional risk to the patient.", "label": 1}

The surface water both before and after disinfection was concentrated by adsorption on C(18) silica cartridges and the concentrates containing non-volatile organics were divided into different portions for chemical analyses and biological assays. The following in vitro tests were conducted on the water concentrates dissolved in DMSO: the Salmonella mutagenicity assay with S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100; the SOS Chromotest with Escherichia coli, the Microtox and Mutatox assays with Vibrio fischeri; and gene conversion, point mutation and mitochondrial DNA mutability assays with D7 diploid Saccharomices cerevisiae strain. The results show that the SOS Chromotest and the yeast assays are highly sensitive in detecting genotoxicity. The surface-water extracts were very often toxic to most of the test organisms considered, partially masking their potential mutagenic activity. Therefore, the assays with E. coli and with S. cerevisiae are more likely to show a mutagenic effect because these organisms are generally less sensitive to most toxic compounds. Among the tested disinfectants, NaClO and ClO(2) increased water genotoxicity, whereas PAA was able to slightly reduce raw water activity. However, because the organic compounds in the lake water varied with the season of the year, the disinfection processes, at times, both increased and decreased the raw water activity.", "label": 0}

Analysis of cross-resistance to PDT in cells with different MDR pathways and resistance levels seems to be advantageous for elucidating the general mechanisms of cancer cell resistance to various treatment modalities. AIM: The aim of the study was to clarify whether the Jurkat/A4 leukemia cells with MDR phenotype are cross-resistant to PDT. METHODS: Human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia line Jurkat and Jurkat/A4 subline with MDR phenotype were used. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and Photolon (a complex of chlorine-e6 and polyvinylpyrrolidone; PL) or gold nanocomposite of PL were applied as photosensitizers. The cells were pretreated with photosensitizers and exposed to laser radiation at corresponding wavelengths. The phototoxicity was assessed in trypan blue exclusion test. The hypodiploid cell fraction was analyzed by flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained cells. Expression of genes related to PDT resistance was analyzed by microarray technique with Affymetrix U133A chips. RESULTS: ALA-mediated PDT resulted in dose-dependent cell death in both lines, the relative photodynamic efficacy in Jurkat/A4 cells being inferior to that in the parental Jurkat cells. There was no correlation between phototoxicity and apoptosis induction both in Jurkat and Jurkat/A4 cells. PL-mediated general phototoxicity in Jurkat cells amounted up to 75% at the maximal photosensitizer dose with about 40% of apoptotic death fraction. PL-phototoxicity in Jurkat/A4 cells was considerably lower. In contrast to Jurkat cells, PL-gold composite did not increase the efficacy of photosensitization as compared to free PL in Jurkat/A4 cells.

In this study, the potential of the recently emerging chip calorimetry for this purpose was analysed. The activity of biofilms of Pseudomonas putida PaW340 was monitored chip-calorimetrically and compared with counts of colony forming units (CFU), bioluminescence-based ATP measurements, and quantitative confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The biofilms were treated with antibiotics differing in their mechanisms of action (bactericidal kanamycin vs. bacteriostatic tetracycline) and referenced to untreated biofilms. For untreated biofilms, all methods gave comparable results. Calorimetric killing curves, however, reflecting metabolic responses to biofilm eradication non-invasively in real time, differed from those obtained with the established methods. For instance, heat signals increased right after addition of the antibiotics. This transient increase of activity was not detected by the other methods, since only calorimetry delivers specific information about the catabolic part of the metabolism. In case of the bactericidal antibiotic, CFU misleadingly indicated successful biofilm eradication, whereas calorimetry revealed enduring activity. Our results show that calorimetry holds promise to provide valuable mechanistic information, thereby complementing other methods of biofilm analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

We found that differences in the distribution of the aluminum hydrolyte species in the coagulant affected the removal of these enteroviruses during coagulation: the removal ratios of PV and CV observed with polyaluminum chloride (PACl) with a high colloidal aluminum content and a basicity of 2.1 (i.e., PACl-2.1c) were larger than those observed with high monomeric aluminum content coagulant (i.e., AlCl3 solution) and with high polymeric aluminum content coagulant PACl (PACl-2.1b). Unlike AlCl3 or PACl-2.1b, PACl-2.1c contains Al-30 species, indicating that Al-30 species probably play a major role in the removal of enteroviruses. The PV and CV removal ratios were almost identical, regardless of the coagulant type or viral quantification method used (plaque-forming unit method or real-time polymerase chain reaction method), suggesting that PV and CV behaved similarly during the coagulation process. We also experimentally confirmed that the main mechanism for virus removal was coprecipitation into growing aluminum hydroxide during charge neutralization; virus adsorption onto formed aluminum hydroxide flocs also contributed to virus removal, but played a limited role.

Pathogens including Escherichia coli O157:H7 have been responsible for spinach outbreaks across the United States. In this study, hurdles, including those currently used with produce safety, such as MAP and chlorine, were combined with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to inhibit pathogens. Spinach was coinoculated with E. coli O157:H7 and Clostridium sporogenes, a surrogate for C. botulinum, and treated with water or a hurdle that included water, chlorine, and LAB. Spinach from treatments were packaged in air (traditional), oxygen (80% O(2), 20% CO(2)), or nitrogen (80% N(2), 20% CO(2)) and stored in a retail display case for 9 d at 4 to 7 degrees C. The hurdle inhibited E. coli O157:H7 and C. sporogenes compared to controls with reductions of 1.43 and 1.10 log (P < 0.05), respectively. The nitrogen atmosphere was outperformed by air and oxygen in the reduction of E. coli O157:H7 (P < 0.05) with a decrease of 0.26 and 0.15 logs. There were no significant differences among the 3 atmospheres on C. sporogenes survival. Relative to these hurdles, we also chose to evaluate the potential benefits of LAB in pathogen control. The survival of LAB in interventions demonstrates implementation of LAB into produce could control pathogens, without damaging produce or altering organoleptic properties. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The goal of our work was to identify methods that could reduce food-borne pathogens in packaged spinach products. Using current industry techniques in combination with unique methods, such as the use of beneficial bacteria, our research identified whether harmful microorganisms could be eliminated.

Here we show that AtPHT4;4, a member of the phosphate transporter 4 family of Arabidopsis thaliana, functions as an ascorbate transporter.

The two nodavirus isolates showed no significant differences in response to the procedures examd. Nodavirus held in cell culture medium contg. 5% fetal bovine serum was effectively inactivated within 4 days at 37\u00b0C and 3 mo at 25\u00b0C but showed no significant loss of titer over 6 mo at 15\u00b0C and still retained a measurable level of infectivity after storage for 1 yr at this temp. Virus suspensions in distd. water tolerated exposure to pH 2-11 with no significant loss of titer over 24 h. Thereafter, a steady diminution in infectivity was noted at pH 11 from day 3 and at pH 2 from day 15 onwards, but no loss of titer was recorded between pH 3-7 over 6 wk storage. Infectivity titers fell gradually at a very similar rate for virus held at 15\u00b0C in balanced salt soln. and full- and half-strength seawater over a 6-mo test period. Virus held in freshwater, however, was markedly less stable and no viable virus could be detected after 6 mo storage. SBNN was susceptible to heat treatment at 60\u00b0C within 30 min with no viable virus detected after 1 h. UV irradn. at an intensity of 440 ?W/cm2 resulted in a 99.9% linear redn. in virus titer after 8 min exposure. Treatment with 2% formalin was not totally effective even after 6 h exposure at 15\u00b0C although virus titer was reduced. The effect of chlorine, iodine and peroxygen on SBNN at 15\u00b0C was noticeably different when org. matter in the form of fetal bovine serum (FBS) was present in the virus diluent. Suspensions of virus in distd. water were completely inactivated within 5 min by 50 ppm chlorine and 25 ppm iodine. Virus in Hanks' BSS+FBS, however, showed only a marginal loss in infectivity following similar treatments and significant levels of infectivity were still detectable after 30 min exposure to 100 ppm of either disinfectant. Treatment with an acid peroxygen disinfectant rapidly reduced virus infectivity in both distd. water and serum supplemented diluent within 5 min but infectious virus was not totally eliminated even after exposure for 30 min.

The specificity of BphD for other 2-hydroxy-6-oxohexa-2,4-dienoates (HODAs) decreased markedly with the size of the C6 substituent; 6-methyl-HODA, the meta cleavage product of 3-methylcatechol, was hydrolyzed approximately 2300 times less specifically than 6-phenyl-HODA, By comparison, the homologous hydrolase from the toluene degradation pathway, TodF, showed highest specificity for 6-methyl- and 6-ethyl-HODA (k(cat)/K-m of 2.0 (+/- 0.05) x 10(6) M-1 s(-1) and 9.0 (+/- 0.5) x 10(6) M-1 s(-1), respectively). TodF showed no detectable activity toward 6-phenyl-HODA and 6-tert-butyl-HODA, Neither BphD nor TodF hydrolyzed 5-methyl-HODA efficiently. The k(cat) of BphD determined by monitoring product formation was about half that determined by monitoring substrate disappearance, suggesting that some uncoupling of substrate utilization and product formation occurs during the enzyme catalyzed reaction.

Probiotics have been introduced to replace antibiotics commonly used for treatment of bacterial infection in aquaculture. This study was conducted to isolate, screen, and evaluate the probiotic Bacillus spp. for potential use as a feed supplement to enhance fish growth, disease resistance and innate immunity of Pla-mong Pangasius bocourti. Bacillus aerius strain B81e was selectively isolated from the intestine of healthy catfish and chosen based on its probiotic properties both in vitro and in vivo. This bacterium produced a bacteriocin-like substance and exhibited a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria especially the fish pathogens Aeromonas hydrophila and Streptococcus agalactiae. The susceptibility to all 8 antibiotics tested implies that it is unlikely to be an antibiotic-resistant bacterium. B. aerius strain B81e possessed interesting adhesion properties as shown by its high percentages of hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with fish pathogens A. hydrophila FW52 and S. agalactiae F3S and mucin binding. The strain B81e survived simulated gastrointestinal conditions, producing protease and lipase but not ?-haemolysin. The study also evaluated the effects of dietary supplementation with strain B81e on growth performance, innate immunity, and the disease resistance of P. bocourti against A. hydrophila infection. Fish with a mean body weight of 69\u00a0g were fed strain B81e at 0 (control) and 107\u00a0CFU\u00a0g?1 feed (test) for 60 days. Various growth and immune parameters were examined at 30 and 60 days post-feeding. Fish were challenged with A. hydrophila 60 days post-feeding and mortalities were recorded over 14 days post-infection. Results showed that the administration of strain B81e for 60 days had significant effects (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05) on weight gain, specific growth rate and feed utilization efficiency of P. bocourti. Dietary administration of strain B81e increased the serum lysozyme and bactericidal activities of P. bocourti significantly throughout the experimental period whereas the alternative complement, phagocytic and respiratory burst activities were significantly (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05) higher in the test fish compared to the control fish after 60 days of feeding. In addition, the fish fed a strain B81e supplemented diet had a significantly higher (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05) post-challenge survival rate than the control fish. The results in this study indicate that B. aerius B81e has beneficial effects on growth performance, innate immunity and disease resistance of P. bocourti.

This process is effective and reproducible, but it is also long and costly and precludes the use of heat-labile materials. The need for an alternative to dry-heat microbial reduction has been identified by space agencies. Investigations assessing the biological efficacy of two gaseous decontamination technologies, vapor hydrogen peroxide (Steris) and chlorine dioxide (ClorDiSys), were undertaken in a 20-m(3) exposure chamber. Five spore-forming Bacillus spp. were exposed on stainless steel coupons to vaporized hydrogen peroxide and chlorine dioxide gas. Exposure for 20 min to vapor hydrogen peroxide resulted in 6- and 5-log reductions in the recovery of Bacillus atrophaeus and Geobacillus stearothermophilus, respectively. However, in comparison, chlorine dioxide required an exposure period of 60 min to reduce both B. atrophaeus and G. stearothermophilus by 5 logs. Of the three other Bacillus spp. tested, Bacillus thuringiensis proved the most resistant to hydrogen peroxide and chlorine dioxide with D values of 175.4 s and 6.6 h, respectively. Both low-temperature decontamination technologies proved effective at reducing the Bacillus spp. tested within the exposure ranges by over 5 logs, with the exception of B. thuringiensis, which was more resistant to both technologies. These results indicate that a review of the indicator organism choice and loading could provide a more appropriate and realistic challenge for the sterilization procedures used in the space industry.", "label": 0}

Fruit were treated at room temperature for 30 min while with the fogger operating and for an additional 30 min in the fog consisting of disinfectants. Treated fruit were stored at 1 \u00b0C for 5 days and an additional 2 days at 20 \u00b0C. The percentage of infected fruit and microorganism populations on the surface of the fruit and in the storage air were evaluated to determine the efficacy of treatments. Chlorine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, citric acid and ethanol significantly reduced the percentage of infected fruit. The percentage of decay was reduced to 14.5% from 83.2% by the hydrogen peroxide treatment at 2000 ?L L?1 and to 32.5% by sodium hypochlorite at 2000 ?L L?1 in the first experiment. In addition, all chemicals significantly reduced the total number of microorganisms on the fruit surface and in the storage atmosphere.

The basal nitrite release and mucosal cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) production were similar in control and BH4-deficient ileum. Mucosally added Escherichia coli heat-stable toxin (STa, 55 ng ml-1) increased the nitrite release, cyclic GMP levels and the Isc in control ileum, but its secretory actions were reduced in BH4-deficient ileum. L-Arginine (1 mM) increased the nitrite release, cyclic GMP production and the Isc in control ileum, but the actions were reduced in BH4-deficient ileum. Serosal carbachol (1 mM) stimulated maximum short-circuit currents of similar magnitude in both control and BH4-deficient ileum, whilst nitrite release and cyclic GMP production were minimal. E. coli STa and L-arginine increased electrogenic Cl- secretion across intact mouse ileum in vitro by releasing nitric oxide and elevating mucosal cyclic GMP.

On the other hand, in the case of a greater supply of L. monocytogenes (108 CFU ml?1), the results showed that the early reduction of L. monocytogenes counts was relatively slow and was followed by a stabilisation of the population, leading to the establishment of a great number of resident cells in the biofilm (105 to 106 CFU cm?2).

{"id": "9241", "title": "Assembly and heterologous expression of the coumermycin A(1) gene cluster and production of new derivatives by genetic engineering", "abstract": "Many secondary metabolites of clinical importance have been isolated from different Streptomyces species. As most of the natural producers remain difficult to handle genetically, heterologous expression of an entire biosynthetic gene cluster in a well characterised host allows improved possibilities for modifications of the desired compound by manipulation of the biosynthetic genes. However, the large size of a functional gene cluster often prevents its direct cloning into a single cosmid clone. Here we describe a successful strategy to assemble the entire coumermycin A, biosynthetic gene cluster (38.6 kb) into a single cosmid clone by A RED recombination technology. Heterologous expression of the reconstituted gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M572 resulted in the heterologous production of coumermycin A(1). Inactivation of the methyltransferase gene couO-responsible for the C-methylotion at the 8-positions of the aminocoumarin moieties in coumermycin A(1)-and heterologous expression of the modified cluster resulted in an accumulation of a C-8-unsubstituted coumermycin A, derivative. Subsequent expression of the halogenase gene clo-hal from the clorobiocin gene cluster in the heterologous producer strain led to the formation of two new hybrid antibiotics, containing either one or two chlorine atoms. The identities of the new compounds were verified by LC-MS, and their antibacterial activities were tested against Bacillus subtilis in an agar diffusion assay.", "label": 0}
{"id": "8916", "title": "Does the major aluminium-resistance gene in wheat, TaALMT1, also confer tolerance to alkaline soils?", "abstract": "Aim: A major limitation to plant growth in acid soils is the prevalence of toxic Al3+. Most genotypic variation for acid soil-tolerance in wheat is linked with the Al3+-activated efflux of malate anions from roots which is controlled by TaALMT1 on chromosome 4DL. Recent studies have also linked TaALMT1 with tolerance to high pH solns. and alk. soils. This study tested the hypothesis that an Al3+-resistant allele of TaALMT1 also confers tolerance to alk. conditions. Methods: The near-isogenic wheat lines, ET8 (Al3+-resistant) and ES8 (Al3+-sensitive), have different alleles of the TaALMT1 gene and contrasting resistance to Al3+ toxicity. Growth of these lines was compared in acid and alk. soils with contrasting mineralogy and in a range of high pH hydroponic solns. of varying compn. Results: No consistent differences in root or shoot growth were detected between the lines in the alk. soils or in the high pH hydroponic treatments. Malate efflux was detected from ET8 in acidic soln. with Al3+ but no substantial malate efflux was detected at pH 9.0 treatment with added Na2SO4. Conclusion: The results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the TaALMT1 gene confers an advantage to wheat on alk. soils. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 0}

{"id": "2568", "title": "Non-conventional methods for the control of post-harvest pear diseases", "abstract": "Pears are highly perishable products, especially during the post-harvest phase, when considerable losses can occur. Among the fungal diseases, blue mold caused by Penicillium expansum, grey mould caused by Botrytis cinerea, Mucor rot caused by Mucor piriformis are common on pear fruits. Other (weak) pathogens like Phialophora malorum, Alternaria spp., and Cladosporium herbarum tend to infect wounds and senescent fruits. A post-harvest fungicide treatment can reduce decay but effectiveness decreases with the appearance of resistant strains. There is a clear need to develop new and alternative methods of controlling post-harvest diseases. The emerging technologies for the control of post-harvest fungal diseases are essentially threefold: application of antagonistic microorganisms, application of natural antimicrobial substances and application of sanitizing products. Two biological control products, Aspire (Candida oleophila I-182) (Ecogen, Langhorne, PA, USA) and Bio-Save 110 (Pseudomonas syringae) (EcoScience, Worcester, MA, USA; formerly Bio-Save 11) are currently registered in the USA for post-harvest application to pears. Other potential biocontrol agents have been isolated from fruit and shown to suppress post-harvest decay in pear. It is important that evaluation of these microorganisms be carried out in a product formulation because the formulation may improve or diminish antagonistic efficacy depending on the concentration of chemical product and the duration of exposure to the treatment. Plants produce a large number of secondary metabolites with antimicrobial effects on post-harvest pathogens. Detailed studies have been conducted on aromatic compounds, essential oils, volatile substances and isothiocyanates, with encouraging results. In particular, allyl-isothiocyanate used as a volatile substance, controls blue mould in 'Conference' and 'Kaiser' pear inoculated with a thiabendazole-resistant strain. Sanitizing products such as chlorine dioxide, peracetic acid and ozone have considerable fungicidal activity against P. expansum and M. piriformis, depending on the concentration of chemical product and the duration of exposure to the treatment. Sanitizing solutions can be integrated easily with current handling and storage practices; however, further research is required to define the effective procedures better.", "label": 0}

{"id": "6689", "title": "Human biomonitoring: State of the art", "abstract": "Human biomonitoring (HBM) of dose and biochemical effect nowadays has tremendous utility providing an efficient and cost effective means of measuring human exposure to chemical substances. HBM considers all routes of uptake and all sources which are relevant making it an ideal instrument for risk assessment and risk management. HBM can identify new chemical exposures, trends and changes in exposure, establish distribution of exposure among the general population, identify vulnerable groups and populations with higher exposures and identify environmental risks at specific contaminated sites with relatively low expenditure. The sensitivity of HBM methods moreover enables the elucidation of human metabolism and toxic mechanisms of the pollutants. So, HBM is a tool for scientists as well as for policy makers. Blood and urine are by far the most approved matrices. HBM can be done for most chemical substances which are in the focus of the worldwide discussion of environmental medicine. This especially applies for metals, PAH, phthalates, dioxins, pesticides, as well as for aromatic amines, perfluorinated chemicals, environmental tobacco smoke and volatile organic compounds. Protein adducts, especially Hb-adducts, as surrogates of DNA adducts measuring exposure as well as biochemical effect very specifically and sensitively are a still better means to estimate cancer risk than measuring genotoxic substances and their metabolites in human body fluids. Using very sophisticated but nevertheless routinely applicable analytical procedures Hb-adducts of alkylating agents, aromatic amines and nitro aromatic compounds are determined routinely today. To extend the spectrum of biochemical effect monitoring further methods should be elaborated which put up with cleavage and separation of the adducted protein molecules as a measure of sample preparation. This way all sites of adduction as well as further proteins, like serum albumin could be used for HBM. DNA-adducts indicate the mutagenicity of a chemical substance as well as an elevated cancer risk. DNA-adducts therefore would be ideal parameters for HBM. Though there are very sensitive techniques for DNA adduct monitoring like P32-postlabelling and immunological methods they lack specificity. For elucidating the mechanism of carcinogenesis and for a broad applicability and comparability in epidemiological studies analytical methods must be elaborated which are strictly specific for the chemical structure of the DNA-adduct. Current analytical possibilities however meet their borders. In HBM studies with exposure to genotoxic chemicals especially the measurement of DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes and 8-hydroxy-2?-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in white blood cells has become very popular. However, there is still a lack of well-established dose\u2013response relations between occupational or environmental exposures and the induction of 8-OHdG or formation of strand breaks which limits the applicability of these markers. Most of the biomarkers used in population studies are covered by standard operating procedures (SOPs) as well as by internal and external quality assessment schemes. Therefore, HBM results from the leading laboratories worldwide are analytically reliable and comparable. Newly upcoming substances of environmental relevance like perfluorinated compounds can rapidly be assessed in body fluids because there are very powerful laboratories which are able to elaborate the analytical prerequisites in due time. On the other hand, it is getting more and more difficult for the laboratories to keep up with a progress in instrumental analyses. In spite of this it will pay to reach the ultimate summit of HBM because it is the only way to identify and quantify human exposure and risk, elucidate the mechanism of toxic effects and to ultimately decide if measures have to be taken to reduce exposure. Risk assessment and risk management without HBM lead to wrong risk estimates and cause inadequate measures. In some countries like in USA and in Germany, thousands of inhabitants are regularly in estigated with respect to their internal exposure to a broad range of environmentally occurring substances. For the evaluation of HBM results the German HBM Commission elaborates reference- and HBM-values.", "label": 0}

Active derivatives induced frameshift mutations in TA98 strain, and differences in the chemical structure resulted in up to 15-fold changes in mutagenic activity. The non-mutagenic compounds are the unsubstituted parent compound and derivatives with para-chloro, para-fluoro, para-diethylamino, meta-bromo and para-dimethylamino groups. They do not show any activity even in strains with higher level of nitroreductase or O-acetyltransferase. The addition of S9 fraction decreases the mutagenic potential or gives comparable results to those obtained without metabolic activation. For electron-donating substituents, the meta-isomers display the greatest mutagenic potency, whereas the transfer of the group to the para-position leads to less active or unactive molecules. All active nitrobenzothiophenes are substrates for bacterial nitroreductase and O-acetyltransferase, as shown by the reduced mutagenicity in the deficient strains and increased mutagenicity in the corresponding overproducing bacteria. Previous reports have pointed out interest in nitrothiophene analogues with para-chloro and para-fluoro substituents as promising anti-inflammatory drugs.

The system was tested with swine wastewater (?15,000 mg/L volatile solids). The COD and solids in the wastewater were reduced by 89% to 97%, and total coliforms and E. coli were reduced by 1 log CFU after treatment with the ASBR and SBRs.

Investigating the underlying mechanisms, we find that poliovirus binds bacterial surface polysaccharides, which enhances virion stability and cell attachment by increasing binding to the viral receptor. Additionally, we identified a poliovirus mutant, VP1-T99K, with reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding. Although T99K and WT poliovirus cell attachment, replication, and pathogenesis in mice are equivalent, VP1-T99K poliovirus was unstable in feces following peroral inoculation of mice. Consequently, the ratio of mutant virus in feces is reduced following additional cycles of infection in mice. Thus, the mutant virus incurs a fitness cost when environmental stability is a factor. These data suggest that poliovirus binds bacterial surface polysaccharides, enhancing cell attachment and environmental stability, potentially promoting transmission to a new host.", "label": 0}

Fruit surfaces spot inoculated with cocktail strains of E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes were exposed to UV-C doses up to 11.9 kJ/m2 at 23 \u00b0C. Fruit surface roughness, contact angle, and surface energy were determined and correlated with UV-C inactivation kinetics. Results demonstrate that bacterial pathogens on fruit surfaces respond differently to UV-C light exposure. E. coli O157:H7 on apple and pear surfaces was reduced by 2.9 and 2.1 log CFU/g, respectively when treated with UV-C light at 0.92 kJ/m2 (60 s). For berries, the reduction of E. coli O157:H7 was lower with 2.0 (strawberry) and 1.1 log CFU/g (raspberry) achieved after UV-C treatment at 7.2 kJ/m2 (8 min) and at 10.5 kJ/m2 (12 min), respectively. Similarly, a higher reduction of L. monocytogenes was observed on apple (1.6 log CFU/g at 3.75 kJ/m2) and pear (1.7 log CFU/g at 11.9 kJ/m2) surfaces compared to cantaloupe and strawberry surfaces (both achieved 1.0 log CFU/g at 11.9 kJ/m2). L. monocytogenes shows more resistance than E. coli O157:H7. Inactivation rates were higher for less hydrophobic fruits with smoother surfaces (apples and pears) as compared to fruits with rougher surfaces (cantaloupe, strawberry and raspberry). Findings indicate that UV-C light can effectively reduce E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes populations on fruit and berry surfaces.

However, a significant proportion of patients show regression, which is commonly associated with comeal haze. This study aims to determine whether biologic and environmental factors influence the outcome of PRK. Methods: One hundred patients prospectively underwent -3.00 or -6.00-diopter corrections. Three months after surgery, 100% of patients answered a questionnaire that recorded their biologic characteristics, medical and ocular history, and postoperative exposure to physical and chemical insults. Multivariable analysis identified those factors associated with regression. Results: Multivariable analysis showed that the risk of regression was increased significantly in patients who underwent higher dioptric or smaller diameter treatments (P = 0.045) and in those who had had regression after treatment of the first eye (P = 0.019). There was no difference between the sexes, but regression was 13.5 times more likely in females who were taking oral contraceptives. Regression was increased in those exposed to solar radiation (odds ratio, 7.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.82\u201332.22) and sun beds (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-9.39), and was significantly greater in patients with ocular-surface disorders (on univariable analysis only; P = 0.034). Regression was not associated with previous contact lens wear, swimming, cigarette smoking, or minor ocular trauma. Conclusion: The questionnaire identified biologic and environmental risk factors for regression. The biologic risk factors may be used preoperatively to counsel patients and, where necessary, advise them against surgery.

One such strain was shown to be a hyper-efficient coloniser of chickens, as it was able to displace other colonising strains, as well as maintain itself in the chicken intestinal tract for the duration of the 56-day broiler production cycle. Once colonisation was established, this hyper-colonising C. jejuni strain, 331, could not be displaced by other colonising or hyper-colonising strains. We proposed that a defined, hyper-colonising strain, or a cocktail of defined strains with a similar phenotype, could form the basis for biological control of unknown/uncharacterised Campylobacter strains from the environment that continuously colonise chicken flocks. To validate this approach, three different chicken infection trials were carried out. These trials demonstrated that the dominant strain of C. jejuni was able to colonise broiler chickens consistently and for the entire life of the birds irrespective of the day of inoculation and antimicrobial agents used in the feed to control other pathogenic micro-organisms. In addition, we have shown that the bio-control strain was able to replace other colonising strains at various points of a 56-day broiler production cycle irrespective of time and type of inoculation.

These Type 021N bacteria were found to be resistant to chlorination, maintaining cell integrity at a dosage of up to 80 mg Cl/gSS. An alternative biocidal agent, cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), exhibited a much stronger biocidal effect on these filaments, which significantly improved sludge settleability. Type 021N with filamentous index of 5 was selectively killed, but floc-formers recovery their activity after CTAB termination. The study implied that CTAB might have more penetration capacity to cell wall of chlorine-resistant Type 021N bacteria.

BACKGROUND DATA: Er:YAG irradiation laser is expected to enhance acid resistance and to produce morphological changes on the enamel surface. METHODS: One hundred twenty samples of human enamel were divided into four groups (n = 30): Group I was the control (no laser irradiation), and Groups II, III, and IV were irradiated with Er:YAG laser at 100 mJ (12.7 J/cm(2)), 100 mJ (7.5 J/cm(2)), and 150 mJ (11 J/cm(2)), respectively, at 10 Hz and with water spray. The samples were placed in an acid solution, and the released calcium was quantified by atomic absorption spectrometry. The weight percentages of calcium, phosphorus, oxygen, and chlorine on the enamel surface were determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The morphological changes were observed by scanning electron microscopy. One-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed (p <or= 0.05) to distinguish significant differences among groups. RESULTS: The weight percentage of calcium in the samples obtained from EDS and the amount of calcium in the solution did not show any significant difference. All irradiated samples showed morphological changes on the enamel surface compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that acid resistance of enamel due to subablative Er:YAG laser irradiation on the samples did not increase as expected.

A flow cytometer was used to track changes in the fluorescence intensity distribution due to exposure to the chemical disinfectant. Microsphere 'survival ratios' (N/No) were calibrated by selecting an appropriate fluorescence intensity threshold to replicate the inactivation of different C. parvum oocysts strains. Results showed that fluorescent microspheres displayed synergistic effects in the presence of two sequential disinfectants. In addition, microsphere structural tests showed that the polystyrene surface was damaged due to exposure to ozone. This polystyrene damage enhanced the diffusion of the secondary disinfectant into the microsphere, where dye was degraded in the opened polymer layer.

Cotton fabric treated with nitrogen plasma and chlorination effectively blocked microorganism growth. The resistance to Staphylococcus aureus bacteria was regenerable, and nitrogen plasma treatment showed no noticeable influence on the tearing strength of the cotton fabric.", "label": 0}
{"id": "9283", "title": "Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to evaluate hydrogen peroxide as a biofouling control agent in membrane treatment systems", "abstract": "Hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) is widely used in water treatment for biofouling control and, in conjunction with catalysts, as a powerful oxidant for contaminant destruction. H2 O2 could potentially serve as an antifouling agent in reverse osmosis systems in lieu of chlorine-based disinfectants. The dependence of the biocidal efficiency of H2 O2 on cell density, temperature and H2 O2 concentration by determining the growth, attachment and viability of the model bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was studied. For controlling growth of planktonic PAO1 cells, the minimally required H2 O2 concentration depends on the cell density and temperature. The effect of H2 O2 to remove the existing biofilm was found to be effective in the presence of a high concentration bicarbonate (8.4 g l(-1) ), which forms peroxymonocarbonate, a strong oxidant and disinfectant. Treatment with H2 O2 -bicarbonate reduced the density of live PAO1 cells, removed extracellular polymeric substances and lowered the average biofilm thickness while maintaining the integrity of the membrane, suggesting that this type of treatment may be a suitable 'in-place-cleaning' procedure for biofouled membranes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: H2 O2 is evaluated as a potential replacement for chlorine to control biofouling in membrane-based water treatment systems. The biocidal efficacy of H2 O2 was evaluated as a function of H2 O2 concentration, cell density and temperature using the model organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Results demonstrated that at low temperatures and low cell densities, bacterial growth and membrane biofouling can be prevented by low H2 O2 concentrations, and existing biofilms could be removed by H2 O2 -bicarbonate mixtures. Findings suggested that H2 O2 could be used as a low cost agent for prevention and controlling biofouling in reverse osmosis applications.", "label": 0}

{"id": "483", "title": "Monte Carlo Simulation of Bacterial Disinfection: Nonlinear and Time-Explicit Intensity of Transition", "abstract": "Bacteria being disinfected in fluid media are discrete entities and mesoscopic in size; moreover, they are incessantly as well as irregularly in motion and in collision among themselves or with the surrounding solid surfaces. As such, it is highly likely that some of the attributes of the bacterial population, for example, their number concentration, will fluctuate randomly. This is especially the case at the tail-end of disinfection when the population of bacteria is sparse. It might be effectual, therefore, to explore the resultant random fluctuations via a stochastic paradigm. Proposed herein is a Markovian stochastic model for the rate of bacterial disinfection, whose intensity of transition takes into account the contact time of the bacteria with the disinfecting agent to eliminate any given percentage of the bacteria in terms of a nonlinear function of time. The model's master equation has been simulated by resorting to the Monte Carlo method to circumvent the undue complexities in solving it analytically or numerically via conventional numerical techniques. For illustration, the mean, the variance (standard deviation), and the coefficient of variation of the number concentration of bacteria during disinfection have been estimated through Monte Carlo simulation. The results of simulation compare favorably with the available experimental data as well as with those computed from the corresponding deterministic model.

Therefore,this study evaluated the microbial flora of produced drinking water of RO treatment system in Kashan city during summer and autumn 2015. In this study the census method have used and the sampling have done from all the RO water treatment centers of the city. Three input,output and after storage,samples have taken. The evaluation of the temperature,residual chlorine,TDS,the storage time,and RO membrane operation time in samples have done. The HPC test has done on the samples in the laboratory and the positive plates have identified in terms of bacterial spices. The tests have repeated in four months of the year from July to October. The results showed 95% residual chlorine in the input samples and the HPC test for these samples showed no contamination. The sample contamination after treatment and the tank were 8 and 15% respectively. In addition,the most contamination level have related to September,which the samples temperature in this month reach its highest level. The Pearson coefficient results showed that there was a significant relation between the Heterotroph colonies number and the residual chlorine and temperature parameters,which was consistent with Karami et al. in Kermanshah and Dobaradaran et al. in Esfahan studies.

The initial structure-activity relationship showed that compounds with a chlorine substitution at position 7 have a higher activity compared with regioisomers or other substituents. Methods The present study evaluated more analogues with a 7-chlorine-substitution in vitro against a broad panel of clinically relevant fungal species. The Microsporum canis model in guinea pigs was used to assess the in vivo efficacy after oral and topical administration. Results IC50 values in the low micromolar range (IC50 0.6-8.0 ?M for dihydro-PBDs; 0.1-0.7 ?M for oxidized PBDs) confirmed the potent and selective in vitro activity of PBDs against dermatophytes, while the activity against A. fumigatus and Candida parapsilosis was slightly lower. For dihydro-PBDs, para-substitution showed superior activity, while oxidized compounds with a meta-substitution performed best. Oxidized Compound O with meta-CF2CH3-substitution showed excellent IC50 values of 0.6 ?M against M. canis, 2.0 ?M against Trichophyton mentagrophytes and 0.7 ?M against Trichophyton rubrum, matching or outperforming the activity of itraconazole (IC50 values of 2.0, 0.4 and 0.6 ?M, respectively). In vivo, topical application of a 0.25% formulation of Compound O gave a lesion reduction of >90% compared with placebo-treated animals. Oral administration of this compound at 20 mg/kg showed superior therapeutic efficacy compared with the reference drug itraconazole. Conclusions In conclusion, PBDs with a chlorine atom at position 7 are very promising antifungal candidates with convincing in vitro and in vivo activity particularly against dermatophytes and should be studied in greater detail to explore their full potential in the treatment of dermatophytoses. \u00a9 The Author 2014.

Samples from GAC columns with empty-bed contact times 7.5, 15, 30, and 60 min were analyzed for heterotrophic plate counts and total coliforms. Effluent samples were also exposed to chloramines and Cl for 60 min (pH 8.2, 23\u00b0). Bacterial identifications were performed on the disinfected and nondisinfected effluents. Studies were conducted to assess the bacteriol. activity assocd. with released GAC particles. The results indicated that heterotrophic plate counts in the effluents from all columns increased to 105 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL within 5 days and subsequently stabilized at 104 CFU/mL. The heterotrophic plate counts did not differ at different empty-bed contact times. Coliforms (identified as Enterobacter species) were recovered from the nondisinfected effluent on only 2 occasions. The disinfection results indicated that 1.5 mg of chloramines/L inactivated ?50% more bacteria than did 1.0 mg Cl/L after 1 h of contact time. Chloramines and Cl selected for the development of different bacterial species Pseudomonas and Flavobacterium, resp. C particles were recovered in the effluent at levels of 10-62 particles/L. SEM revealed that 8% of the particles had no detectable colonized bacteria, 77% were colonized with 1-50 bacterial cells, and 8% were colonized with several hundred to several thousand bacterial cells. On one occasion, a fecal coliform identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae was desorbed from a C particle. Disinfection studies indicated that bacteria attached to the GAC particles were extremely resistant to Cl and chloramines at 1.5 mg/L, even after 40 min of exposure. The findings suggest that chloramines may be more effective than Cl in controlling the heterotrophic plate counts resulting from GAC treatment when the bacterial population is predominantly composed of non-Pseudomonas. These studies also indicate that bacterially colonized GAC particles released into the product water are extremely resistant to disinfection. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}

These items were washed with automatic (49 degrees C) and manual (43 degrees C) dishwashers then treated with electrolyzed-oxidizing water (EO), quaternary ammonium compound, sodium hypochlorite and an acidic sanitizer. For the lowest efficacies, after six and eight manual washing cycles in the same solution, >= 5 log reductions were achieved on both E. coli K12 contaminated trays and plates, respectively, exposed to the chlorine and quaternary ammonium sanitizers. For automatic washing with chlorine sanitizer, the minimum wash cycles for the bacteria were seven and nine for the trays and plates, respectively. For drinking glasses contaminated with bacteria, 14 and 17 washing cycles produced >= 5 log reductions for manual and automatic washings, respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Resistance to disinfectants is mainly attributed to the association of cells with amoebae, but biofilms are also thought to provide some degree of protection. In the present work, a two-stage chemostat was used to form heterotrophic biofilms from drinking water to study the influence of chlorine on the presence of naturally occurring L. pneumophila. The pathogen was tracked in planktonic and sessile biofilm phases using standard culture recovery techniques for cultivable cells and a peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridisation assay for total cells. The results showed that the total number of L. pneumophila cells in biofilms was not affected by the concentrations of chlorine tested, and the presence of L. pneumophila could not be detected by culturing. To restrict the outbreaks of disease caused by this bacterium, efforts need to be concentrated on preventing L. pneumophila from re-entering an infectious state by maintaining residual disinfectant levels through the entire DWDS network so that the resuscitation of cells via contact with amoebae is prevented.", "label": 0}

After primary and secondary treatments, the wastewater underwent filtration through sand/hydroanthracite filters. A total of 20 samplings were made, each consisting of two instant samples (secondary effluent and filtered effluent). Each of the 40 samples was tested for: total and faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci and somatic coliphages. The mean concentrations detected in the secondary effluent were in the order of 5 log for the total and faecal coliforms, 4 log for enterococci and Escherichia coli, and approx. 3 log for the coliphages. The filtration showed a higher efficacy in the reduction of faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli and in particular total coliforms. The results obtained for enterococci and coliphages were significantly lower. Filtration alone was not enough to reduce the bacterial indicators to within Italian legal limits, and showed a poor capacity to abate coliphages. However, by performing the filtration before disinfection, secondary effluents require a lower dose of disinfectant. This results in less pollution of surface waters from by-products and a consequent reduction in the chemical risk for the general population.", "label": 0}

The efficacy of treatments varied with exposure time, application rate, water type and the pathogen and propagule. Cl. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, Ph. cinnamomi and Py. aphanidermatum propagules were most sensitive to all treatments, while propagules of Ch. elegans, Ca. pauciramosa and F. oxysporum required the highest rates and longest exposure times to chlorine, chlorine dioxide and UV to kill >99 % CFUs.

This research aimed to optimize and evaluate the concentration of free chlorine (hypochlorous acid [HOCl]) used as a sanitizer to prevent cross-contamination of tomatoes inoculated with a cocktail of five rifampin-resistant Salmonella enterica serovars in a laboratory-based model flume system. Organic load, prepared using sterilized Scotts Premium Topsoil, was added in different quantities to the flume wash water to simulate real-world packinghouse conditions. In a typical packinghouse operation utilizing a recirculating flume system, the organic matter washed from tomato surfaces accumulates over time. In this study, different concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 ppm) of HOCl were used as sanitizers under three organic load conditions (0, 650, and 1,000 mg/L chemical oxygen demand). Results showed that 100 ppm of HOCl was necessary to prevent Salmonella cross-contamination of uninoculated tomatoes in the model flume system in the presence of organic loading. Also, when treated with 100 ppm of HOCl, Salmonella levels were reduced by >4.5 log CFU per tomato from inoculated tomatoes in the presence of organic load. At 75 ppm of HOCl, Salmonella cross-contamination was prevented, but only in the absence of organic loading. In studies in which plate counts were negative, whole tomato enrichment studies were performed. No cross-contamination of uninoculated tomatoes was recorded when 100 ppm of HOCl was used, even in the presence of high organic load (1,000 mg/L chemical oxygen demand).

The mutagenicity of the chlorinated solutions generally reached a peak level shortly after chlorination and then declined afterwards, a pattern different from that of chloroform generation.

The effect of layer-by-layer coatings of polyelectrolytes on the chlorine loading and antibacterial efficacy of sutures was evaluated. The straight-pull and knot-pull strength tests performed on the sutures reported slight decline in tensile properties after chlorination treatment. The in vitro hemolysis and cytocompatibility tests revealed that the N-halamines-based antibacterial sutures were biocompatible. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

Methods and Results : A total of 10 and 36 samples were collected from two domestic water supplies and four spa facilities, resp. Simkania negevensis was isolated in Acanthamoeba castellanii monolayers and detected by Gimenez staining and immunofluorescence test. Simkania negevensis DNA, extd. from the pos. samples, was confirmed by a nested PCR assay followed by sequencing. Simkania negevensis was detected in 41\u00b73% of samples (domestic water: 50%; untreated spa supply water: 25%; chlorinated spa pool water: 42\u00b79%) from all the examd. water systems in successive samplings performed in 1 yr. The presence of S. negevensis was not correlated with the counts of Heterotrophic Bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Unlike Legionella spp., which were never isolated from the swimming-pool water samples, S. negevensis was also detected in chlorinated spa water. Conclusions : This investigation shows that Simkania is widespread in natural and man-made aquatic environments, which may represent possible sources of infection: in the swimming pools, in particular, the aerosol generated by the water movement could increase the risk of inhalation of infected particles. Significance and Impact of the Study : This study represents the first evidence of the presence of S. negevensis in spa pool water. Sero-epidemiol. surveys on spa users could help to clarify its transmission in this environment. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}

(typhimurium NRRL-B-4420 and S. typhimurium CCM 583 at the level of approximately 106 cfu/ml. The samples were treated with koruk juices produced by different methods (by using mortar and electrical blender) for 0, 15, 30 and 60 min. Salmonella cells were counted by using direct surface plating (on Tryptone Soya Agar, Bismuth Sulphite Agar or Xylose Desoxylate Agar with 50ppm, nalidixic acid;, TSAN, BSAN or XLDN) and overlay plating (on TSAN/BSAN) methods. Counts on TSAN/BSAN or TSAN, BSAN and XLDAN were not significantly different (P > 0.05). So, further experiments were done with direct surface plating on TSAN and BSAN. Overall statistical analysis indicated that, the antimicrobial effect of koruk juice was found to be dependent on the culture strains and products used (P < 0.05). Koruk juice exerted an immediate antimicrobial effect contact with the test microorganisms causing 1-1.5 log cfu/g reductions in initial populations. However, cell reductions in samples exposed to koruk juice for 15, 30 and 60 min varied between 2 and 3.5 logcfu/g depending on the microorganism and test sample used. There was no significant difference in cell reduction in samples exposed to koruk juices for 15, 30 and 60 min (P > 0.05) whereas reduction obtained at 0 time differed significantly (P < 0.05). On the other hand, no significant differences were found between the antimicrobial effects of koruk juices prepared by different methods. Results of the study showed that koruk juice used as flavouring and acidifying agent in Turkish kitchens, may be considered to be an alternative potential antimicrobial agent at household level for salad vegetables.

The objective of this study was the assessment of phys., chem. and bacteriol. quality of the drinking water in the city of Tetova and several surrounding villages in the Republic of Macedonia for the period May 2007-2008. The sampling and anal. are conducted in accordance with State Regulation No. 57/2004, which is in compliance with EU and WHO stds. A total of 415 samples were taken for chem., phys. and bacteriol. anal. We had used the Canadian Drinking Water Quality Index (DWQI) for the quality assessment of drinking water. The results of the samples taken in Tetova point to better hygienic and sanitary conditions than in the rural drinking network, mainly due to improper disinfection practices. The results show that the highest water quality was recorded at the SEEU (DWQI = 92.69), whereas the lowest quality at Shipkovica (DWQI = 63.18). This study strongly recommends the immediate correction of these issues to protect the health of population from water borne diseases as well as regular monitoring of the drinking water quality in the region.

When both cultivars were subjected to seawater stress, the leaves of the Helan No. 3 spinach preferred potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and sulfate (SO4(2-)) over sodium (Na+) and chlorine (Cl-) to keep high ratios of K/Na, Mg/Na, Ca/Na, and SO4(2-)/Cl- compared with the Yanye spinach. Moreover, those of the Helan No. 3 spinach under the seawater stress showed high efficiency of accumulation of compatible solutes (sugars and proline), low degradation of proteins, and suppression of free amino acids. However, the activities of plasma membrane H+ -ATPase and tonoplast H+ -ATPase in the leaves of spinach with the stress were enhanced. Taken together, the Helan No. 3 spinach under the seawater stress seems to acquire a high tolerance to the seawater salinity by inducing a high ion uptake, low concentration of Na+ and Cl-, efficient accumulation of compatible solutes, low decomposition of proteins, and suppression of free amino acids in the leaves.", "label": 0}

Due to the low reactivity of dT toward a platinum source, we chose dT8 and dT15 as our initial synthetic targets for platination. Post-synthetic reaction of the platinum reagent with the diamino oligothymidine generates the diamino dichloro platinum-DNA conjugate that can be used for DNA duplex targeting by oligodeoxyncleotide-mediated triplex formation. The dT8 sequence is not sufficiently long to facilitate triplex formation and Pt-cross-linking, whereas with a dT15 sequence cross-linking between the third strand and the duplex occurs exclusively with the duplex target strand directly involved in triplex formation. No examples of cross-linking to the complementary target strand, or of cross-linking to both target strands are observed. Most efficient cross-linking occurs when the dinucleotide d(GpG) is present in the target strand and no cross-linking occurs with the corresponding 7-deazaG dinucleotide target. Cross-linking is also observed when dC or dA residues are present in the target strand, or even with a single dG residue, but it is not observed in any cases to dT residues. Triplex formation provides the ability to target specific sequences of double-stranded DNA and the orientational control arising from triplex formation is sufficient to alter the binding preferences of platinum. Conjugates of the type described here offer the potential of delivering a platinum complex to a specific DNA site.", "label": 0}

A synergetic disinfection effect was observed when HPU was combined with peroxyacetic acid (PAA) or a commercial mix of organic acids and phenolic compounds (OA/PC). In recycled water (RW) with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 500\u00a0mg O2/l, PAA inactivated 2 log units of Escherichia coli O157:H7 at concentrations of 3.2, 6.4, 16\u00a0mg/l after 7\u00a0min, 2\u00a0min, 29\u00a0s, respectively. The OA/PC or HPU treatments alone needed 26\u00a0min treatments to achieve the same reduction. The addition of TiO2 (5\u00a0g/l) to HPU (sonocatalysis) did not improve E.\u00a0coli O157:H7 inactivation. However, when HPU was combined with a residual concentration of PAA (3.2\u00a0mg/l), the total inactivation of E.\u00a0coli O157:H7 and Salmonella (6 log unit reductions) occurred after 11\u00a0min, but for Listeria monocytogenes only 1.7 log reductions were detected after 20\u00a0min. When HPU was combined with OA/PC, a synergistic effect for the inactivation of E.\u00a0coli O157:H7 was also observed, but this sanitizer significantly modified the physical-chemical quality characteristics of the RW. These results show that the residual PAA concentration that can be found in the wash water combined with HPU could result in an environmentally friendlier and toxicologically safer strategy for water reconditioning of the fresh-cut industry. The use of the sanitizer alone requires higher concentrations and/or longer contacts times. Even though the residual PAA in combination with HPU was adequate for water reconditioning, it is not appropriate for the process wash water because this wash water must be instantaneously disinfected.", "label": 0}

AIT was encapsulated in calcium alginate beads (AIT beads) and the release of AIT as affected by temperature and relative humidity (RH) was determined. The release rate of AIT from beads increased with increased temperature, but was not significantly affected by RH. A low-density polyethylene (LDPE) sachet containing AIT beads (Air sachet) was prepared and the rate of release of AIT as affected by film thickness and temperature was studied. The release of AIT from sachets increased significantly with decreased LDPE thickness and increased temperature. Finally, antimicrobial effects of the AIT sachet against Escherichia coli 0157:H7 and molds and yeasts (MY) on fresh spinach leaves were determined. E. coli 0157:H7 and MY had similar sensitivities to Art vapor. The number of E. coli 0157:H7 on spinach leaves (5.6 log CFU/leaf) decreased by 1.6-2.6 log CFU/leaf at 4 degrees C and 2.1-5.7 log CFU/leaf at 25 degrees C within 5 days. The reduction of E. coli 0157:H7 was significantly greater at 85% RH than at 43% RH. Reductions on control leaves (no AIT sachet) did not exceed 1.2 log CFU/leaf under any of the test conditions.

This study was initiated in 24 outdoor lysimeters to determine effects of salinity and varying concentrations of nitrogen on the growth, yield, and ion relations of stock [Matthiola incana (L.) R. Br.] cultivar Cheerful White. The experiment was a 4 x 4 factorial, partially replicated design with four irrigation water salinities (2, 5, 8, and 11 dS.m(-1)) and four nitrate concentrations (2.5,3.6, 5.4, and 7.1 mmol.L-1; N = 35, 50, 75, and 100 ppm). Ammonium nitrogen was included in the nutrient solutions. Stem lengths were measured three times weekly. Measurements at final harvest were stem and inflorescence lengths, stem and floret diameters, number of axillary buds and florets, and shoot and root fresh weights. Time course of stem elongation was quantified as a function of thermal time with a phasic growth model. Salinity significantly delayed initiation of the exponential growth phase, shortened its duration, and reduced the rate of plant development. The overall effect was to delay time to harvest of marketable stems. Although length of the flowering stems decreased with increasing salinity, marketable stems (approximate to 60 cm) were produced in all treatments. Mineral ion relations in the plant tissues were influenced significantly, but independently, by both salinity and nitrogen. Leaf sodium, magnesium, and chlorine concentrations increased with increasing salinity; calcium and potassium decreased. In response to increasing external nitrogen, both potassium and chlorine decreased; sodium increased, whereas calcium and magnesium were unaffected. We conclude that in closed-loop irrigation systems, the nitrogen requirements for stock are low and that growers could minimize costs and limit off-site pollution by reducing nitrogen inputs.", "label": 0}

Results indicated that SD had higher ability to inactivate E. coli than the others, indicating there was a positive synergistic effect on chlorine disinfection by prior dosing with a low level of chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)). The ONPG assay suggested that the permeability of cell wall rather than the viability of E. coli were changed under 0.02 mg/l ClO(2) treatment. The coexistence of residual ClO(2) and free chlorine also plays an active synergistic effect.

Control specimens exposed to a solution of aqueous 25 microM CHX (equivalent to the residual aqueous CHX present with the NPs) did not exhibit CHX release. CHX HMP NP-coated surfaces exhibited antimicrobial efficacy against oral primary colonising bacterium Streptococcus gordonii within 8 h.

Despite a growing awareness and intensified research many uncertainties remain, especially with respect to the risk of potential zoonotic transmission. Water supplies can be monitored for cysts using automated cytofluorimetric immunoassays, but this does not measure infectivity. Filtration provides the best protection, because cysts are highly resistant to chlorine and ozone. Other incompletely elucidated aspects include mechanisms of pathogenicity, host reaction to infection, immunity and parasite control using vaccines or antigiardial compounds; the 5-nitroimidazole metronidazole is the most effective of these. Molecular typing of various isolates indicates that most animal parasites are not infective to humans, but those that are can be genotypically classified as assemblage A or B. The phylogeny of the organism remains uncertain, but there is a growing opinion that Giardia is not an ancient primitive eukaryote, but that it is derived from a more complex mitochondria-containing protozoon.", "label": 1}

Commercially processed and eviscerated broiler carcasses were collected from a commercial processing plant, individually bagged, and transported to the pilot processing plant. In experiment 1, carcasses were air chilled to 4 degrees C. In experiment 2, carcasses were immersion chilled with or without chlorine. After air chilling, Salmonella was detected on 78% of NS and 89% of WCE samples. Only one Salmonella serogroup was detected from each of 13 Salmonella-positive NS samples, and two serogroups were detected on 1 Salmonella-positive NS sample. Only one Salmonella serogroup was detected from each of 13 Salmonella-positive WCE samples, and two serogroups were detected from 3 Salmonella-positive WCE samples. After immersion chilling without chlorine, Salmonella was detected on 38% of NS, 45% of WCR, and 100% of WCE samples. Without chlorine, the 15 Salmonella-positive NS samples included 14 samples with one serogroup and 1 sample with two serogroups. Only one Salmonella serogroup was detected from WCR samples after immersion chilling. Of 40 Salmonella-positive WCE samples, 23 had a one, 14 had two, and 3 had three Salmonella serogroups. After immersion chilling with chlorine, Salmonella was detected on 35% of NS, 0% of WCR, and 90% of WCE samples. With chlorine, the 14 Salmonella-positive NS samples included 11 samples with one serogroup and 3 samples with two serogroups. No Salmonella serogroups were detected from WCR samples after immersion chilling with 20 mg/liter free chlorine. The 36 Salmonella-positive WCE samples included 21 samples with one serogroup and 15 samples with two serogroups.

The impact of these species on the host and their potential contributions to mucosal immune homeostasis remain poorly studied. Here, we show that the protozoan Tritrichomonas musculis activates the host epithelial inflammasome to induce IL-18 release. Epithelial-derived IL-18 promotes dendritic cell-driven Th1 and Th17 immunity and confers dramatic protection from mucosal bacterial infections. Along with its role as a \u201cprotistic\u201d antibiotic, colonization with T.\u00a0musculis exacerbates the development of T-cell-driven colitis and sporadic colorectal tumors. Our findings demonstrate a novel mutualistic host-protozoan interaction that increases mucosal host defenses at the cost of an increased risk of inflammatory disease.", "label": 0}

In attempting to achieve this balance, the U.S. EPA will propose three rules: an information collection (ICR); an enhanced surface water treatment rule (ESWTR) and a two-stage D/DBP rule. Controlling D/DBP will have a major impact on drinking water utilities in the United States. There are several options for D/DBP control, including moving the point of disinfection, removal of by-products once they are found, removing precursor material or natural organic matter before it interacts with the disinfectant, or use of a disinfectant that minimizes the formation of by-products. The least-expensive approach to D/DBP control is to move the point of disinfection or the use of an alternative disinfectant. The least desirable approach is to remove disinfection by-products once they are formed. Overall, the most effective approach to D/DBP control is to remove precursor before it reacts with the disinfectant. The choice of any given strategy is very site specific.", "label": 1}

After 15 weeks of storage at 7.2 \u00b0C, the combination of PS treatment (3 min dip in 3% solution at 21 \u00b0C) and CA storage was as effective as the combination of heated fludioxonil (30 s dip in 0.6 g L?1 of active ingredient at 49 \u00b0C) and air storage. Mixtures of PS with SB or SC did not improve the efficacy of either treatment alone. In tests conducted in commercial facilities, decay development and external and internal fruit quality were assessed on naturally infected pomegranates stored in either air or CA after application of a selected postharvest antifungal combined treatment (CTrt) integrating PS, SB + chlorine, and fludioxonil. CTrt was effective in controlling natural gray mold after 6 weeks of storage at 8.9 \u00b0C, but lacked persistence and it was not effective after 14 weeks. CA storage greatly enhanced decay control ability of CTrt. Skin red color was better maintained in CA-stored than in air-stored fruit.

However, due to public health and environmental concerns, alternative disinfectants are required. In this study, the control of Pseudomonas fluorescens planktonic and biofilm cells was assessed with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), SH, 3-bromopropionyl chloride (BPC) and 3-bromopropionic acid (BPA). Their effects were tested against planktonic cells in terms of antimicrobial efficiency and changes on cell surface. CTAB had the lowest min. inhibitory concn. or min. bactericidal concn.

Their action was also assessed in the control of flow-generated biofilms. Modest killing and removal was achieved (max. killing of 1 log and 16% of total biofilm removal) due to the characteristics of the biofilm. In general, both BPC and CTAB had antimicrobial activities similar to SH and therefore demonstrated potential as alternatives to SH in P. fluorescens control. Practical Applications : The potential environmental and health problems caused by the uncontrolled use of sodium hypochlorite (SH) have led to the search for alternatives, maintaining the antimicrobial efficacy. In fact, SH is included in the indicative list of the Directive on Industrial Emissions (2010/75/EU) as a major pollutant for water emissions and on the formation of carcinogenic and mutagenic products in the presence of org. matter. Therefore, in this study, the antimicrobial potential of selected halogen-based products was assessed in order to compare their efficacy with SH in the control of planktonic and biofilm cells. All products caused apparent membrane pore formation as well as hydrophobicity and surface charge modification against planktonic cells. Addnl., 3-bromopropionyl chloride and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide demonstrated similar action to SH in the control of biofilms mimicking an industrial scenario. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}

The correlation between dynamic FC concentrations and bacterial survival was investigated during commercial washing of chopped Romaine lettuce, shredded Iceberg lettuce, and diced cabbage as pathogen inoculation study during commercial operation is not feasible. Wash water was sampled every 30 min and assayed for organic loading, FC, and total aerobic mesophilic bacteria after chlorine neutralization. Water turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, and total dissolved solids increased significantly over time, with more rapid increases in diced cabbage water. Combined chlorine increased consistently while FC fluctuated in response to rates of chlorine dosing, product loading, and water replenishment. Total bacterial survival showed a strong correlation with real-time FC concentration. Under approximately 10 mg/L, increasing FC significantly reduced the frequency and population of surviving bacteria detected. Increasing FC further resulted in the reduction of the aerobic plate count to below the detection limit (50 CFU/100 mL), except for a few sporadic positive samples with low cell counts. This study confirms that maintaining at least 10 mg/L FC in wash water strongly reduced the likelihood of bacterial survival and thus potential cross contamination of washed produce.", "label": 1}

The incidence and severity have been increasing. Elderly persons are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality from C. difficile infection (CDI). Relatively few advances have been made in the treatment of CDI since it was first identified as a cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea more than 30 years ago. Objective This article reviews CDI and provides an update on its treatment, including recently published clinical practice guidelines and the recently approved drug, fidaxomicin. Methods English-language literature was identified through a search of PubMed (1966\u2013October 2011), Iowa Drug Information Service (1966\u2013October 2011), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970\u2013October 2011). Key search terms included Clostridium difficile, Clostridium infections, pseudomembranous colitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, elderly, geriatric, epidemiology, microbiology, diagnosis, risk factors, treatment, drug therapy, vancomycin, metronidazole, and fidaxomicin. Results Metronidazole and vancomycin remain the mainstays of CDI treatment. Current guidelines recommend oral metronidazole for initial mild to moderate episodes or first recurrence. Oral vancomycin is recommended for initial severe episodes, or first or second recurrence. Fidaxomicin was approved in 2011 for treatment of CDI, but its place in therapy has yet to be determined. Other antibiotics have been used with variable success. Saccharomyces boulardii is the only probiotic that has shown efficacy in CDI. Fecal transplants have been used successfully in some patients, but randomized studies are needed. Immune therapy with a vaccine and monoclonal antibodies is being studied in clinical trials. Conclusions Treatment of CDI is challenging due to the limited number of drugs that have proven to be effective, concerns about antibiotic resistance, and recurring disease. The recent approval of fidaxomicin provides a new alternative. Immune therapy will likely play a greater role in the future.", "label": 0}

Algae and equipment-clogging biofilms also result from high microbial levels in irrigation water. The literature was reviewed on the effectiveness of water treatment options to control waterborne microbes. Water treatments included chemicals (chlorine, bromine, chlorine dioxide, ionized copper, copper salts, ionized silver, ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and peroxyacetic acid), non-chemical or physical treatments (filtration, heat, and ultraviolet radiation) and ecological alternatives (constructed wetlands, biosurfactants, and slow sand filtration). The objective was to summarize the effective dose for controlling target waterborne microorganisms. The effective dose for chemical water treatments to control plant pathogens was in some cases above documented phytotoxicity thresholds, and for most crops and technologies the phytotoxicity thresholds remain unknown. Most efficacy research has been conducted on chlorine (20 articles) or copper (18), but only 0-7 articles were found on other water treatments currently in use, indicating major knowledge gaps in treatment efficacy. Research is needed on control methods for algae and biofilms, in vivo pathogen studies, phytotoxicity thresholds, and the relationship between pathogen inoculum level and disease incidence in irrigation water. Finally, improved overall system design is required for risk management of waterborne microbes in irrigation, including a multiple barrier approach incorporating pre-filtration, multiple treatment stages, and monitoring of water quality.

Typical drinking water bacterial biofilms and their response to different concentrations of chlorination was monitored. The results showed that the four bacteria all formed single biofilms susceptible to sodium hypochlorite. After 30 min disinfection, biomass and cultivability decreased with increasing concentration of disinfectant but then increased in high disinfectant doses. PMA-qPCR results indicated that it resulted in little cellular damage. Flow cytometry analysis showed that with increasing doses of disinfectant, the numbers of clusters increased and the sizes of clusters decreased. Under high disinfectant treatment, EPS was depleted by disinfectant and about 0.5-1 mg/L of residual chlorine seemed to be appropriate for drinking water treatment. This research provides an insight into the EPS protection to biofilms. Resistance of biofilms against high levels of chlorine has implications for the delivery of drinking water.", "label": 1}

Identification of the granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as an indispensable mediator of macrophage maturation and surfactant catabolism was the key discovery leading to the current understanding of the pathogenesis of most forms of PAP. Impaired GM-CSF bioavailability due to anti-GM-CSF autoimmunity is the cause of approximately 90% of adult PAP cases. Abnormal macrophage function due to endogenous or exogenous triggers, GM-CSF receptor defects, and other genetic abnormalities of surfactant production account for the remainder of causes. The usual physiological consequence of PAP is impairment of gas exchange, which can lead to dyspnoea, hypoxaemia, or even respiratory failure and death. Pulmonary fibrosis occurs occasionally in patients with PAP. For patients with moderate to severe disease, whole lung lavage is still the first-line treatment of choice. Supplemental GM-CSF is also useful, but details about indications, choice of agent, and dosing remain unclear. Other therapies, including rituximab, plasmapheresis, and lung transplantation have been described but should be reserved for refractory cases.", "label": 0}
{"id": "4097", "title": "Role of discontinuous chlorination on microbial production by drinking water biofilms", "abstract": "Microbial quality in water distribution systems is strongly affected by the development of microbial biofilms. Production and release of microbial cells by the biofilm affect microbial levels in the water column and in some cases this fact constitutes a public health concern. In this study, we attempt to analyze in which way the existence of different episodes of chlorine depletion affects both biofilm formation and microbial load of an artificial laboratory system. The work was carried out using two parallel packed bed reactors both supplied with running tap water. One of the reactors was used as a control and was permanently exposed to the action of chlorine. In the other reactor, chlorine was neutralized at selected times during the experiment and for periods of variable length. During the experiment the concentration of total and viable cells from the effluent was monitored at the exit of each of the reactors. The data obtained were used to estimate microbial production from the biofilms. As an average, release of microbial cells to the water phase increased tenfold in the absence of chlorine. The results also indicate that disinfectant efficiency against the biofilm was not recovered when chlorine returned to normal levels after each event of chlorine neutralization. Cell viability in the water phase in the presence of chlorine was low at the beginning of the experiment but increased 4 orders of magnitude after five neutralization periods. Therefore, subsequent episodes of chlorine depletion may accelerate the development of microbial communities with reduced susceptibility to disinfection in real drinking water systems.

Experimental studies include the synthesis and characterization of six new and six known pentacene derivatives and a kinetic study of each derivative under identical photooxidative conditions. Structures, HOMO-LUMO energies and associated gaps were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G**//PM3 level while optical and electrochemical HOMO-LUMO gaps were measured experimentally. The combined results provide for the first time a quantitative assessment of HOMO-LUMO gaps and photooxidative resistances for a large series of pentacene derivatives as a function of substituents. The persistence of each pentacene derivative is impacted by a combination of steric resistance and electronic effects as well as the positional location of each substituent. Silylethynyl-substituted pentacenes like TIPS-pentacene possess small HOMO-LUMO gaps but are not the longest lived species under photooxidative conditions, contrary to popular perception. A pentacene derivative with both chlorine substituents in the 2,3,9,10 positions and o-alkylphenyl substituents in the 6,13 positions is longer lived than TIPS-pentacene. Of all the derivatives studied, alkylthio- and arylthio-substituted pentacenes are most resistant to photooxidation, possess relatively small HOMO-LUMO gaps and are highly soluble in a variety of organic solvents.

In this study, a novel setup using UV processing in agitated water was developed to inactivate Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella on blueberries. Blueberries were dip- or spot-inoculated with E. coli or Salmonella. Blueberries inoculated with E. coli were treated for 2 to 10 min with UV directly (dry UV) or immersed in agitated water during UV treatment (wet UV). E. coli was most easily killed on spot-inoculated blueberries with a 5.2-log reduction after 10-min wet UV treatment. Dip-inoculated blueberries were the most difficult to be decontaminated with only 1.6-log reduction after 10-min wet UV treatment. Wet UV treatment generally showed higher efficacies than dry UV treatment, achieving an average of 1.4 log more reduction for spot-inoculated blueberries. For dip-inoculated blueberries, chlorine washing and UV treatments were less effective, achieving <2 log reductions of E. coli. Thus, the efficacy of combinations of wet UV with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), levulinic acid, or chlorine was evaluated. Inoculated blueberries were UV-treated while being immersed in agitated water containing 100 ppm SDS, 0.5% levulinic acid or 10 ppm chlorine. The 3 chemicals did not significantly enhance the wet UV treatment. Findings of this study suggest that UV treatment could be used as an alternative to chlorine washing for blueberries and potentially for other fresh produce.

A 41 kDa glycoprotein was identified in the mouse enterocyte membrane fraction with which the ESP interacted in a GM1-specific manner. The GTPase activity was reduced in enterocytes stimulated with the ESP, resulting in an increase in the level of adenylate cyclase-dependent cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The activity of protein kinase A (PKA) in the enterocytes was also upregulated after ESP treatment. Ultimately, a significant increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and decrease in cytosolic Cl- level were noticed in ESP-stimulated mouse enterocytes.

Although quant. (real-time) reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) is widely used for detecting HuNoVs, it only detects the presence of viral RNA and does not indicate viral infectivity. Human blood group antigens (HBGAs) have been identified as receptors/co-receptors for both HuNoVs and Tulane virus (TV) and are crucial for viral infection. We propose that viral infectivity can be evaluated with a mol. assay based on receptor-captured viruses. In this study, we employed TV as an HuNoV surrogate to validate the HBGA-based capture qRT-PCR method against the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) method. We employed type B HBGA on an immuno-well module to conc. TV, followed by amplification of the captured viral genome by in situ qRT-PCR. We first demonstrated that this in situ capture qRT-PCR (ISC-qRT-PCR) method could effectively conc. and detect TV. We then treated TV under either partial or full inactivation conditions and measured the remaining infectivity by ISC-qRT-PCR and a tissue culture-based amplification method (TCID50). We found that the ISC-qRT-PCR method could be used to evaluate virus inactivation deriving from damage to the capsid and study interactions between the capsid and viral receptor. Heat, chlorine, and ethanol treatment primarily affect the capsid structure, which in turns affects the ability of the capsid to bind to viral receptors. Inactivation of the virus by these methods could be reflected by the ISC-qRT-PCR method and confirmed by TCID50 assay. However, the loss of the infectivity caused by damage to the viral genome (such as that from UV irradn.) could not be effectively reflected by this method. Despite this limitation, the ISC-qRT-PCR provides an alternative approach to det. inactivation of Tulane virus. A particular advantage of the ISC-qRT-PCR method is that it is also a faster and easier method to effectively recover and detect the viruses, as there is no need to ext. viral RNA or to transfer the captured virus from magnetic beads to PCR tubes for further amplification. Therefore, ISC-qRT-PCR can be easily adapted for use in automated systems for multiple samples. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}
{"id": "4585", "title": "Campylobacters as zoonotic pathogens: A food production perspective", "abstract": "Campylobacters remain highly important zoonotic pathogens worldwide which infect an estimated 1% of the population of Western Europe each year. Certain campylobacters are also important in infections of animals, particularly of the reproductive tract, and some are involved in periodontal disease. This paper focuses, however, on the two species which are most important in food-borne infections of humans, Campylobacter (C.) jejuni and C. coli. Infection with these campylobacters is serious in its own right but can also have long-term sequelae such as reactive arthritis and Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. The pathogens are ubiquitous in nature and in domestic animals and, as a consequence, are found frequently in the environment and on many raw foods, of both plant and animal origin and bacterial numbers can be very high on certain key foods like raw poultry meat. Although all commercial poultry species can carry campylobacters, the risk is greater from chicken because of the high levels of consumption. Campylobacters are relatively \u2018new\u2019 zoonotic pathogens as routine culture from clinical specimens only became possible in the late 1970s. As a consequence there is much that still needs to be understood about the behaviour and pathogenicity of these highly important bacteria. In particular, and from a food industry/food safety perspective, it is important to better understand the behaviour of C. jejuni and C. coli in the food production environment, and how this affects their ability to survive certain food production processes. There is a belief that campylobacters are much more sensitive to hostile conditions than either salmonellas or Escherichia coli. Much of data to support this view have been derived from laboratory experiments and may not fully represent the natural situation. Studies are showing that campylobacters may be more robust than previously thought and thus may represent a greater challenge to food safety. We recommend that research is undertaken to better understand how campylobacters behave in the food chain and how responses to relevant conditions affect their ability to survive processing and their virulence. There is also a need to better understand the reasons why campylobacters are capable of frequent change, particularly in the expression of surface antigens.", "label": 1}

Proteins induced in strains JB2 and D1 by growth on 2-chlorobenzoate (2-CBa) were extracted from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Two bands gave significant matches to OhbB and OhbA, which have been reported to be the alpha and beta subunits, respectively, of an ortho-1,2-halobenzoate dioxygenase of P. aeruginosa strain 142 (T. V. Tsoi, E. G. Plotnikova, J. R. Cole, W. F. Guerin, M. Bagdasarian, and J. M. Tiedje, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65:2151-2162, 1999). PCR and Southern hybridization experiments confirmed that ohbAB were present in strain JB2 and were transferred from strain JB2 to strain D1. While the sequences of ohbA from strains JB2, D1, and 142 were identical, the sequences of ohbB from strains JB2 and D1 were identical to each other but differed slightly from that of strain 142. PCR analyses and Southern hybridization analyses indicated that ohbAB were conserved in strains JB2 and D1 and in strain 142 but that the regions adjoining these genes were divergent. Expression of ohbAB in Escherichia coli resulted in conversion of o-chlorobenzoates to the corresponding (chloro)catechols with the following apparent affinity: 2-CBa approximately 2,5-dichlorobenzoate > 2,3,5-trichlorobenzoate > 2,4-dichlorobenzoate. The activity of OhbAB(JB2) appeared to differ from that reported for OhbAB(142) primarily in that a chlorine in the para position posed a greater impediment to catalysis with the former. Hybridization analysis of spontaneous 2-CBa(-) mutants of strains JB2 and D1 verified that ohbAB were lost along with the genes, suggesting that all of the genes may be contained in the same mobile element.

A DNA alkylator (N,N-bis-2-chloroethyl aniline) was linked to a steroid ligand (17?-hyroxy-estra-?4(5),9(10)-3-one) to produce a complex molecule (11?-dichloro) that forms DNA adducts that bind the androgen receptor (AR). We speculated that DNA adducts in an AR-DNA adduct complex would be camouflaged from DNA repair proteins that would otherwise remove the adducts in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, transcription dependent on the AR would be antagonized by AR redistribution to sites distant from AR-driven promoters. The anticancer potential of 11?-dichloro was demonstrated against prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. 11?-dichloro induces a unique pattern of gene disruption, induces apoptosis in apoptosis-resistant cells, and shows promising anticancer activity in animals.", "label": 0}

HAV detection in food is mainly carried out by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). The discrimination of infectious and inactivated viruses remains a key obstacle when using RT-qPCR to quantify enteric viruses in food samples. Initially, viability dyes, propidium monoazide (PMA) and ethidium monoazide (EMA), were evaluated for the detection and quantification of infectious HAV in lettuce wash water. Results showed that PMA combined with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Triton) was the best pretreatment to assess HAV infectivity and completely eliminated the signal of thermally inactivated HAV in lettuce wash water. This procedure was further evaluated in artificially inoculated foods (at concentrations of ca. 6 \u00d7 104, 6 \u00d7 103 and 6 \u00d7 102 TCID50) including lettuce, parsley, spinach, cockles and coquina clams.

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the individual and combined efficacies of germicidal UV light (12.5 to 500 mJ/cm(2)), acidified sodium hypochlorite (ASC; 10 to 200 ppm), and mild heat (40 to 50 degrees C) for decontaminating green onions and baby spinach infected with Escherichia coli O157:H7. Samples were inoculated by spot and dip inoculation methods to mimic surface and infiltrated E. coli O157:H7 contamination, respectively. In green onions and baby spinach, the individual efficacies of UV, ASC, and mild-heat treatments varied based on the produce type and contamination method. Following analysis of the efficacies of the single treatments, a combined treatment with 125 mJ/cm(2) UV and 200 ppm of ASC at 50 degrees C was selected for spot-inoculated green onions, and a combined treatment with 125 mJ/cm(2) UV and 200 ppm of ASC at 20 degrees C was selected for spot- and dip-inoculated baby spinach. While a >5-log reduction was achieved with the combination treatment for spot-inoculated green onions with an initial contamination level of 7.2 log CFU per spot, the same treatment reduced E. coli O157:H7 populations below the detection limit (<1 log) on green onions spot inoculated at a lower contamination level (4.3 log CFU per spot). On spot- and dip-inoculated baby spinach, the combined treatment reduced E. coli O157:H7 populations by 2.8 log CFU per spot and 2.6 log CFU/g, respectively. The combined treatment of 500 mJ/cm(2) UV and 200 ppm of ASC at 50 degrees C selected for the decontamination of dip-inoculated green onions resulted in a 2.2-log CFU/g reduction. These findings suggest that when foodborne pathogens contaminate produce and subsequently infiltrate, attach to, or become localized into protected areas, the individual or combined applications of UV, ASC, and mild-heat treatments have limited decontamination efficacies on both green onions and baby spinach (<3 log). However, treatments combining UV, ASC, and mild heat could be a promising application for reducing pathogen populations (>5 log) on E. coli O157:H7 surface-contaminated green onions.

S. chlorophenolicum appears to have assembled a poorly functioning pathway for degradation of PCP by patching enzymes recruited via two independent horizontal gene transfer events into an existing metabolic pathway. Flux through the pathway is limited by PCP hydroxylase. PCP hydroxylase is a dimeric protein that belongs to the family of flavin-dependent phenol hydroxylases. In the presence of NADPH, PCP hydroxylase converts PCP to tetrachlorobenzoquinone (TCBQ). The kcat for PCP (0.024 s -1) is very low, suggesting that the enzyme is not well evolved for turnover of this substrate. Structure-activity studies reveal that substrate binding and activity are enhanced by a low pKa for the phenolic proton, increased hydrophobicity, and the presence of a substituent ortho to the hydroxyl group of the phenol. PCP hydroxylase exhibits substantial uncoupling; the C4a-hydroxyflavin intermediate, instead of hydroxylating the substrate, can decompose to produce H2O2 in a futile cycle that consumes NADPH. The extent of uncoupling varies from 0 to 100% with different substrates. The extent of uncoupling is increased by the presence of bulky substituents at position 3, 4, or 5 and decreased by the presence of a chlorine in the ortho position. The effectiveness of PCP hydroxylase is additionally hindered by its promiscuous activity with tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ), a downstream metabolite in the degradation pathway. The conversion of TCHQ to TCBQ reverses flux through the pathway. Substantial uncoupling also occurs during the reaction with TCHQ. \u00a9 2012 American Chemical Society.", "label": 0}

Whole lettuce leaves and tomatoes were spot-inoculated with 100 muL of a mixture of 5 strains of E. coli O157:H7. Washing lettuce with SAEO water for 15 s reduced the pathogen by 1.4 to 1.6 log CFU/leaf, but the treatments did not completely inactivate the pathogen in the wash solution. Increasing the washing time to 30 s increased the reductions to 1.7 to 2.3 log CFU/leaf. Sequential washing in SAEO water for 15 s and then chilling in SAEO water for 15 min also increased the reductions to 2.0 to 2.4 log CFU/leaf, and no cell survived in chilling solution after treatment. Washing tomatoes with SAEO water for 8 s reduced E. coli O157:H7 by 5.4 to 6.3 log CFU/tomato. The reductions were increased to 6.6 to 7.6 log CFU/tomato by increasing the washing time to 15 s.

We applied this method in 38 samples of 10 l of water taken from each of the water treatment steps and in 8 samples taken at home (only for Toxoplasma PCR) in Quindio region in Colombia. There were 8 positive samples for Cryptosporidium parvum (21 %), 4 for Cryptosporidium hominis (10.5 %), 27 for Toxoplasma gondii (58.6 %), 2 for Giardia duodenalis assemblage A (5.2 %), and 5 for G. duodenalis assemblage B (13.1 %). By IFAT, 23 % were positive for Giardia and 21 % for Cryptosporidium. An almost perfect agreement was found between IFAT and combined results of PCR, by Kappa composite proportion analysis. PCR positive samples were significantly more frequent in untreated raw water for C. parvum (p = 0.02). High mean of fecal coliforms, high pH values, and low mean of chlorine residuals were strongly correlated with PCR positivity for G. duodenalis assemblage B. High pH value was correlated with PCR positivity for C. parvum. Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences was possible, showing water and human clinical sequences for Toxoplasma within the same phylogenetic group for B1 repeated sequence. PCR assay is complementary to IFAT assay for monitoring of protozoa in raw and drinkable water, enabling species identification and to look for phylogenetic analysis in protozoa from human and environmental sources.", "label": 0}

Historically, most evaluations of the potential risk for biological weaponry have focused on the military, but the recent release of anthrax in the United States demonstrates that civilian populations are also at risk. More likely than not, most bioterrorism events will be of a small scale; however, agents such as Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis could leave hundreds of thousands dead or incapacitated. The impact of the attack will depend on a number of variables, including the agent used, method of dispersal, and the responsiveness of the public health system.

These illnesses are more common in summer. Waterborne illnesses are underreported because most recreational activity occurs in unsupervised venues or on private property, and participants tend to disperse before illness occurs. Symptoms of waterborne illness are primarily gastrointestinal, but upper respiratory and skin manifestations also occur. Gastrointestinal symptoms are usually self-limited, and supportive treatment may be all that is necessary. However, some infections can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Cryptosporidium and Giardia intestinalis are the most common cause of gastrointestinal illness and have partial chlorine resistance. Respiratory infections are typically mild and self-limited. However, if legionnaires' disease develops and is unrecognized, mortality may be as high as 10%. Cellulitis caused by Vibrio vulnificus can result in serious illness, amputation, and death. Early and appropriate antibiotic treatment is important. Chronically ill and immunocompromised persons are at high risk of infection and should be counseled accordingly.", "label": 1}

This disease, transmitted mainly via the fecal-oral route (in water or food), is of major socioeconomic importance globally. The diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis, including the genetic characterization of the different species, genotypes and subgenotypes (population variants) of Cryptosporidium, is crucial to prevention and control, particularly as there is no cost-effective treatment against this disease. Although traditional phenetic techniques have had major deficiencies for the specific diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis, there has been substantial progress in the establishment of molecular tools. In this article, we review key genetic markers used for the specific identification of Cryptosporidium, diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis and analysis of genetic variation in Cryptosporidium populations. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of selected techniques, and emphasize the benefits of utilizing rapid mutation scanning in achieving improved insights into the population genetics and epidemiology of Cryptosporidium.", "label": 0}

We observed that dapsone was a much better inhibitor of the eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) in an assay that measured peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine at pH 5.4. To clarify the specificity and pH-dependence of dapsone inhibition of the purified enzymes under more physiologic conditions, we studied peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of chloride to the antimicrobial and cytotoxic agent hypochlorous acid. Taurine was added as a trap for hypochlorous acid, to prevent inactivation of the enzymes or chlorination of dapsone by hypochlorous acid. Dapsone was much more effective as an inhibitor of both MPO and EPO when chloride rather than tetramethylbenzidine was the substrate. Inhibition of both enzymes was greater at neutral pH than at acid pH (pH7 vs pH5), but EPO was more sensitive to inhibition than MPO regardless of pH. Inhibition was increased by lowering chloride, raising hydrogen peroxide, or lowering the enzyme concentration. Inhibition was accompanied by irreversible loss of enzyme activity, which was correlated with loss of the heme absorption spectrum, indicating chemical modification of the enzyme active site. EPO, but not MPO, was partially protected against inactivation by adding physiologic levels of bromide along with chloride. The results suggest that dapsone could prevent MPO- and EPO-mediated tissue injury at sites where the peroxidase enzymes are secreted and diluted into the neutral pH environment of the tissue interstitial space. Dapsone might not inhibit peroxidase-mediated antimicrobial activity, which occurs at high enzyme concentrations in the acid environment of phagolysosomes.", "label": 0}

However, the mechanism of alachlor carcinogenicity is poorly understood. Alachlor was administered i.p. to male Long-Evans rats for up to 28 days at doses that are carcinogenic in chronic studies in order to study olfactory lesion development and alterations in cell proliferation. Neither treatment-related olfactory mucosal lesions nor regenerative cell proliferation, as assessed with BrdU labeling, was detected. In vitro genotoxicity studies using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 showed that alachlor was non-mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activation. When pre-incubated with an olfactory mucosal S9 activation system, alachlor induced a weak, dose-dependent mutagenic response at 500-1250 micrograms/plate, with toxicity at higher doses. In contrast, an S9 activation system derived from nasal respiratory mucosa, the tissue physically juxtaposed with the olfactory mucosa but reportedly not susceptible to alachlor-induced tumors, did not produce a mutagenic response for alachlor or the positive control. Thus, this result suggested site-specificity of alachlor activation consistent with the target site of carcinogenicity. The mutagenicity of alachlor to Salmonella, in the presence of an olfactory mucosal-activating system, was confirmed by a limited positive response in the mouse lymphoma assay. Here there were increases in small colony mutants (indicative of chromosomal effects) as well as large colony mutants (which reflect gene mutations). This study suggests that target tissue bioactivation of alachlor results in the formation of one or more mutagenic metabolite(s), which may be critical in alachlor-induced nasal tumorigenesis.

Cooperative incubation of bacterial cells, which carry active hlyII gene, and Chara corallina cells caused a decrease in the resting potential (Vm) and plasma membrane resistance (Rm) of algal cells. The efficiency of each strain was commensurable with its ability to produce HlyII. Purified hemolysin II caused a similar effect on Vm and Rm of intact and perfused cells. This protein changed the kinetics and magnitude of transient voltage-dependent calcium and calcium-activated chloride currents owing to the formation of additional Ca2 +-permeable pores in algal cell membrane.

Water quality data were analyzed together with an existing epidemiol. database to investigate links between microbial quality of drinking water, household demographics, health outcomes, socio-economic status, hygiene and sanitation practices. Groundtank households had better quality drinking water than households using storage containers filled from communal tankers. Uncovered storage containers had the poorest microbial water quality among all storage containers. All stored water did not meet drinking water stds., although mains water did. Households with children under 5 years and using open-topped containers had the poorest water quality overall. Households with groundtanks had the best water quality at point-of-use, but did not have the lowest occurrence of health effects. Although groundtanks were supplied together with urine diversion (UD) toilets and hygiene education, groundtank households showed overall poorer hygiene practices than tanker-supplied households, and some groundtank households with UD toilets preferred to continue using open defecation.

We tested the quaternary metal oxide (TiO2-Sb2O5-SnO 2-RuO2) as the anode material in an EC cell for the inactivation of the spores. The presence of chloride ions at low concentrations was found to be critical for the effective inactivation of BT spores. Active chlorine was produced in-situ by anodic oxidation of chloride in the solutions. Local tap water used as a realistic test solution was found to contain average chloride concentrations of 1.2 mM. High concentrations of active chlorine were generated in the range of 0.35 to 0.5 mM (25 to 35 mg/L) to ensure that the high concentrations of spores were inactivated. We showed that the amount of active chlorine produced in the EC cell can be readily controlled by the operating conditions, including potential, flow rate and chloride content. Scanning electron images of the EC treated spores indicate damage to the outer membranes resulting in disruption and leakage of the spore contents.

The evaluation was conducted with a conventional (coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration), demonstration-scale, plant treating 5.5 million-gal-per-day of California State project water (SPW). Treatment plant performance based on effluent turbidity, particle count, and filter run time was evaluated under varying dosages of disinfectants and coagulant (ferric chloride [FeCl3]). Results showed that total trihalomethanes (TTHM) and five regulated haloacetic acids (HAA5) measured after chlorination formed up to 86 ?g/L TTHM at 90th percentile occurrence levels for bromide (Br-) in SPW (0.5 mg/L). However, TTHMs following ozone or ClO2 disinfection were consistently below regulated max. contaminant levels (MCLs). Moderate ozone dose of 2.0 mg/L formed up to 18 ?g/L of bromate (Br-=0.5 mg/L). ClO2 disinfection formed up to 1.5 mg/L chlorite, currently regulated at an MCL of 1.0 mg/L.

METHODS: The pharmacodynamics of midazolam was studied in rats which received a constant rate infusion of the drug for 14 days, resulting in a steady-state concentration of 102 +/- 8 ng x ml(-1). Vehicle treated rats were used as controls. Concentration-EEG effect data were analysed on basis of the operational model of agonism. The results were compared to data obtained in vitro in a brain synaptoneurosomal preparation. RESULTS: The relationship between midazolam concentration and EEG effect was non-linear. In midazolam pre-treated rats the maximum EEG effect was reduced by 51 +/- 23 microV from the original value of 109 +/-15 microV in vehicle treated group. Analysis of this change on basis of the operational model of agonism showed that it can be explained by a change in the parameter tissue maximum (Em) rather than efficacy (tau). In the in vitro studies no changes in density, affinity or functionality of the benzodiazepine receptor were observed. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the observed changes in the concentration-EEG effect relationship of midazolam upon chronic treatment are unrelated to changes in benzodiazepine receptor function.", "label": 0}

At 8 DIM, cows fed HS also tended to have a higher percentage of monocytes involved in oxidative burst and a higher monocyte oxidative burst index compared with LS cows. At 8 DIM, blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) isolated from cows fed monensin during the periparturient period tended to have higher PMN glycogen content compared with control cows. At 40 to 60 DIM, the incidence of cytol. endometritis as diagnosed by uterine cytol. was not affected by dietary treatment. However, at 40 to 60 DIM, cows fed monensin had an increased percentage of Escherichia coli-stimulated PMN, tended to have a greater percentage of monocytes involved in oxidative burst, and tended to have an increased E. coli-stimulated monocyte oxidative burst index. At 40 to 60 DIM, blood PMN isolated from cows fed HS during early lactation had higher PMN glycogen content compared with cows fed LS during early lactation. Overall, results suggest that feeding higher starch diets postpartum and peripartal supplementation with monensin may have some beneficial effects on immune function, although uterine cytol. was not affected by treatment.

Ten grams of lettuce were inoculated with three strains of each pathogens and treated with aerosolized malic acid for 20 min and UV-C for 30 min. After each treatment, lettuce was stored at 5 degrees C for 15 days. Sequential treatment (aerosolized malic acid after UV-C) was the most effective for reducing E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes and resulted in reduction of 2.89, 1.38, and 2.95 log(10) CFU/g after treatment and 3.15, 3.00, and 4.58 log(10) CFU/g after 15 days, respectively. These results suggested that combined treatment with aerosolized malic acid after UV-C can be a useful intervention method for improving the microbial safety of fresh-cut produce. Practical applications The experiment suggested new method on the inactivation of foodborne pathogens on lettuce.

Ballast water has been a principal pathway of non-indigenous species introduction to global ports for much of the 20th century. In an effort to reduce the scale of this pathway, and recognizing forthcoming global regulations that will supplant ballast water exchange (BWE) with ballast water treatment (BWT), we explore whether a combined hybrid treatment of BWE and chlorination (Cl) exceeds individual effects of either BWE or chlorination alone in reducing densities of bacteria, microplankton and macroplankton. 2. Five full-scale trials were conducted on an operational bulk carrier travelling between Canada and Brazil. 3. The hybrid treatment generally had the lowest final densities among all treatments for putative enterococci, Escherichia coli and coliform bacteria, as well as microplankton and macroplankton, with the former two being synergistically lower than individual treatments alone. Microplankton abundance in the hybrid treatment was significantly but antagonistically reduced relative to individual treatments alone. Macroplankton final density was lowest in the hybrid treatment, though the interaction between treatments was not significant. 4. Synthesis and applications. In most cases, the combined hybrid treatment of ballast water exchange (BWE) and chlorination reduced population densities of indicator organisms in ballast water below those proposed by the International Maritime Organization's D-2 performance standards. BWE alone was often ineffective at reducing bacterial and macroplankton densities. Even when performance standards are implemented globally, continued use of BWE could further reduce risk of invasions to freshwater ecosystems that receive ballast water from foreign sources by accentuating the decline in propagule pressure and enhancing demographic constraints for putative invaders.", "label": 1}

Fresh blueberries are among high risk foods assocd. with norovirus related outbreaks. Therefore, it is important to assess intervention strategies to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. The disinfection efficiency of decontamination methods is difficult to evaluate for fruits and vegetables due to an inconsistent degree of contamination and irregular surface characteristics. The inactivation efficiency and mechanism of murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1, a surrogate for HuNoV) was studied on an exptl. prepd. solidified agar matrix (SAM) to simulate blueberries using different wavelengths (A, B, C) of UV light both with and without TiO2 photocatalysis (TP). MNV-1 was inoculated on exterior and interior of SAM and inactivation efficiencies of different treatments were investigated using a no. of assays. Initial inoculum levels of MNV-1 on the SAM surface and interior were 5.2 log PFU/mL. UVC with TiO2 (UVC-TP) achieved the highest level of viral redn. for both externally inoculated and internalized MNV-1. Externally inoculated MNV-1 was reduced to non-detectable levels after UVC-TP treatment for 5 min while there was still a 0.9 log viral titer after UVC alone. For internalized MNV-1, 3.2 log and 2.7 log redns. were obtained with UVC-TP and UVC alone treatments for 10 min, resp. The Weibull model was applied to describe the inactivation behavior of MNV-1, and the model showed a good fit to the data. An excellent correlation between the steady-state concn. of OH radicals ([\u00b7OH]ss) and viral inactivation was quantified using a para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) probe compd., suggesting that OH radicals produced in the UV-TP reaction were the major species for MNV-1 inactivation. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that the structure of viral particles was completely disrupted with UVC-TP and UVC alone. SDS-PAGE anal. showed that the major capsid protein VP1 was degraded after UVC-TP and UVC alone. Real-time RT-qPCR anal. showed that UVC-TP and UVC alone caused a redn. in the level of viral genomic RNA. Propidium monoazide (PMA) pretreatment RT-qPCR anal. showed that UVC-TP caused damage to the viral capsid protein in addn. to viral genomic RNA. UVC both with and without TiO2 was more effective for MNV-1 inactivation than UVB and UVA.

However, some disadvantages exist such as the formation of disinfection byproducts and parasite resistance. Alternative methods for water disinfection are being used often in conjunction with chlorine to address these problems. One of these alternatives is using the soln. generated from the electrolysis of brine, consisting of both the anolyte and catholyte, for the disinfection of drinking water. Although this soln. consists primarily of chlorine, it likely contains numerous other oxidant species generated during the electrolysis process and is often termed a mixed-oxidant soln. (MOS). Not only has MOS been shown to be more effective at the disinfection of drinking water compared to equiv. doses of chlorine, but it also has been shown to have some interesting characteristics. These include the inhibition of biofilm within the pipe system and inactivation Cryptosporidium parvum, a chlorine resistant parasite. However, to date, attempts to identify what species in the MOS is responsible for the enhanced properties have been challenging and unsuccessful.

{"id": "4755", "title": "Resistance responses of microorganisms in food environments", "abstract": "Food borne microorganisms display a broad spectrum of resistance responses to naturally occurring and intentionally added antimicrobial agents. Resistance may be conferred by innate structural features of the bacterial strain such as an impermeable outer membrane or a mechanism for antibiotic-inactivation. Bacteria previously susceptible to an antimicrobial compound can acquire resistance through mutation or through genetic transfer processes such as transformation, transduction, and conjugation. Resistance can also be conferred by biofilm formation on food processing surfaces as an adaptive response to protect colonies from cleaning and sanitation. Resistant pathogens are a global problem, facilitated by international trade of raw and processed foods. Cross resistance between clinical and nonclinical antimicrobials can exist and is of concern. The development of resistant foodborne pathogens has been attributed to increased antibiotic use in hospitals, outpatient facilities, and veterinary applications. Resistant microorganisms can also develop as a result of physical processes used in food preservation, such as acid treatments and irradiation processes. Strategies to effectively counter resistance development include: changing current practices of antibiotic usage, developing new antibiotics, applying hurdle preservation approaches, preventing bacterial adhesion, and utilizing competitive exclusion. This paper presents an overview of problems arising from the development of microbial resistance, and explores possible solutions for detecting and defeating the adaptive changes of microorganisms.", "label": 0}

The aim of this research was to assess the potential for internalization of an enteric pathogen (Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium) in a leafy vegetable (baby spinach) during washing as influenced by three postharvest handling conditions: (i) illumination, (ii) negative temperature differential, and (iii) relative humidity (RH). To compare these potential postharvest handling conditions, leaves were exposed to different levels of illumination (0, 1,000, and 2,000 lx), temperature differential (5, 11, 14, 20, and 26 degrees C), and RH (99, 85, and 74%) for a short time before or during washing. Washing of baby spinach was carried out in water containing green fluorescent protein-tagged Salmonella Typhimurium (6.5 log CFU/ml) at 5 degrees C for 2 min, followed by surface disinfection with chlorine (10,000 mug/ml) for 1 min, two rinses in water for 10 s, and spin drying for 15 s. Internalization was assessed by enumerating the pathogen on Salmonella-Shigella agar and by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Illumination of spinach leaves before and during washing and a negative temperature differential during washing did not significantly (P > 0.05) increase the number of internalized bacteria. However, exposure of leaves to low-RH conditions before washing, which reduced the tissue water content, decreased internalization of Salmonella compared with internalization in baby spinach exposed to high RH (P </= 0.05). Green fluorescent protein-tagged Salmonella Typhimurium was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy at a depth of up to 30 m m beneath the surface of spinach leaves after exposure to a high inoculum level (8 log CFU/ml) for an extended time (2 h).

Microbial and health risks affecting such systems have not been systematically characterized outside outbreak investigations. The objective of the study was to evaluate associations between self-reported gastrointestinal illnesses (GII) and household-level water supply characteristics. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of water quality, water supply characteristics, and GII in 906 households served by 14 small and medium-sized community water supplies in Alabama's underserved Black Belt region. RESULTS: We identified associations between respondent-reported water supply interruption and any symptoms of GII (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.65-5.49), as well as low water pressure and any symptoms of GII (aOR: 4.51, 95% CI = 2.55-7.97).

A quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) method was used to quantify the ARG damage to amp(R) (850 bp) and kan(R) (806 bp) amplicons, both of which are located in the pUC4K plasmid. The plate count and flow cytometry methods were also used to determine the bacterial inactivation parameters, such as culturability and membrane damage, respectively. In the first part of the study, the kinetics of E. coli inactivation and ARG damage were determined in phosphate buffered solutions. The ARG damage occurred much more slowly than E. coli inactivation in all cases. To achieve 4-log reduction of ARG concentration at pH 7, the required chlorine exposure and UV fluence were 33-72 (mg x min)/L for chlorine and 50-130 mJ/cm(2) for UV and UV/H2O2. After increasing pH from 7 to 8, the rates of ARG damage decreased for chlorine, while they did not vary for UV and UV/H2O2. The i-ARGs mostly showed lower rates of damage compared to the e-ARGs due to the protective roles of cellular components against oxidants and UV. The contribution of OH radicals to i-ARG damage was negligible in UV/H2O2 due to significant OH radical scavenging by cellular components. In all cases, the ARG damage rates were similar for amp(R) versus kan(R), except for the chlorination of e-ARGs, in which the damage to amp(R) occurred faster than that to kan(R). Chlorine and UV dose-dependent ARG inactivation levels determined in a wastewater effluent matrix could be reasonably explained by the kinetic data obtained from the phosphate buffered solutions and the expected oxidant (chlorine and OH radicals) demands by water matrix components. These results can be useful in optimizing chlorine and UV-based disinfection systems to achieve ARG inactivation.", "label": 1}

To test its potential for zebra mussel control, we investigated its effects on zebra mussel viability and on contractility of siphon/mantle muscle preparations in vitro. Metaldehyde caused zebra mussel mortality within 48 h at concentrations of approximately 0.1 and 0.2 g litre(-1). The same concentrations of metaldehyde activated a complex, excitatory response in previously quiescent siphon/mantle preparations but did not modify the contractile responses of the preparations to acetylcholine. The relatively low level of toxicity of metaldehyde to zebra mussels, compared to its toxicity to snails and slugs, and the difficulty of applying this relatively insoluble molluscicide in the aqueous environment suggest that metaldehyde would not be an effective zebra mussel control agent.

{"id": "503", "title": "Sensitivity to commercial disinfectants, and the occurrence of plasmids within various Listeria monocytogenes genotypes isolated from poultry products and the poultry processing environment", "abstract": "The European Suspension Test was used to assess the relative resistance of 19 individual Listeria monocytogenes genotypes, isolated from the poultry processing environment, to three commercially used disinfectants employed in the plant at the time of their isolation. To establish the relative resistance between the strains, the concentration of each disinfectant was reduced until inter-strain variation became apparent. For Darasan 214 and 7058, variation was detected at 0.1% and 0.5% v/v, respectively, while Daraclean 7361 had to be reduced to only 2.5% v/v. At these concentrations, the mean microbiocidal effect (ME) of each disinfectant ranged between 4.3 and 3.1 log(10) reduction in cfu ml(-1). Significant differences between the strains were obtained with respect to their resistance to the disinfectants employed (P < 0.01), but the overall log(10) reduction for genotypes 'A(1)' and 'A(2)', which were found to persist in the poultry processing environment, were not found to be significantly different from the genotypes which had been isolated on a more sporadic basis (P > 0.05). The L. monocytogenes strains fell into four groups with respect to incidence and size of plasmids isolated. The first group contained strains which carried two plasmids (5 and 40 MDa) and the other three (groups 2, 3 and 4) comprised strains which carried a single plasmid (14, 47 and 52 MDa, respectively). There was no correlation between persistent and sporadic strains with respect to incidence and size of plasmids isolated. Moreover, the strains which carried no plasmids were found to be as resistant to the disinfectants as those which did carry plasmids, suggesting that the plasmids isolated did not confer resistance of L. monocytogenes planktonic cells to the disinfectants tested. Therefore, it is unlikely that the strains which had been found to persist in the poultry processing environment did so by means of plasmid-mediated resistance to the commercial disinfectants used.", "label": 0}
{"id": "194", "title": "Enhanced inactivation of Salmonella and Pseudomonas biofilms on stainless steel by use of T-128, a fresh-produce washing aid, in chlorinated wash solutions", "abstract": "The effect of the washing aid T-128 (generally recognized as safe [GRAS] formulation, composed mainly of phosphoric acid and propylene glycol) on inactivation of Salmonella and Pseudomonas populations in biofilms on stainless steel was evaluated under conditions of increasing organic matter loads in chlorinated wash solutions dominated by hypochlorous acid. Biofilms were formed statically on stainless steel coupons suspended in 2% lettuce extract after inoculation with Salmonella enterica serovar Thompson or Newport or with Pseudomonas fluorescens. Coupons with biofilms were washed in chlorine solutions (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 mg/liter at pH 6.5, 5.0 and 2.9), with or without T-128, and with increasing loads of organic matter (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1.0% lettuce extract). Cell populations on coupons were dispersed using intermittent, pulsed ultrasonication and vortexing and enumerated by colony counts on XLT-4 or Pseudomonas agars. Cell responses to fluorescent viability staining of biofilm treatment washing solutions were examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results showed that 0.1% T-128 (without chlorine) reduced P. fluorescens biofilm populations by 2.5 log(10) units but did not reduce Salmonella populations. For both Salmonella and Pseudomonas, the sanitizing effect of free chlorine (1.0 to 5.0 mg/liter) was enhanced (P < 0.05) when it was combined with T-128. Application of T-128 decreased the free chlorine depletion rate caused by increasing organic matter in wash waters and significantly (P < 0.05) augmented inactivation of bacteria in biofilms compared to treatments without T-128. Image analysis of surfaces stained with SYTO and propidium iodide corroborate the cultural assay results showing that T-128 can aid in reducing pathogen viability in biofilms and thus can aid in sanitizing stainless steel contact surfaces during processing of fresh-cut produce.", "label": 1}
{"id": "5690", "title": "Selection and evaluation of new antagonists for their efficacy against postharvest brown rot of peaches", "abstract": "During the growing seasons 2007 and 2008, 210 isolates of yeasts or yeast-like fungi were obtained from the carposphere of temperate fruit collected from organic orchards in Northern Italy. Through six rounds of in vivo screening, three isolates showing the highest biocontrol efficacy against Monilinia laxa on peaches were selected. By using molecular and morphological tools, the strain AP6 was identified as Pseudozyma fusiformata, the strain AP47 as Metschnikowia sp., and the strain PL5 as Aureobasidium pullulans. This research represents the first evidence about the potential use of P. fusiformata to control postharvest diseases of fruit. By co-culturing in vitro M. laxa in the presence of the three antagonists, neither the inactivated cells nor the culture filtrate of the three isolates had any significant effect on spore germination or germ tube elongation, allowing exclusion of the production of secreted toxic metabolites. The antagonistic activity of A. pullulans PL5 and P. fusiformata AP6 was dependent on the cell concentration. Metschnikowia sp. AP47 significantly inhibited spore germination at the three concentrations tested (106 cells/mL, 107 cells/mL, and 108 cells/mL). The efficacy of the three strains was tested on peaches stored at three different temperatures, and their effectiveness was higher at 1 \u00b0C than at 8 \u00b0C or 20 \u00b0C. In trials carried out in semi-commercial conditions with peaches inoculated by spraying 105 spores/mL of M. laxa and stored for 21 d at 1 \u00b0C and 96% RH, a cell concentration effect on the control of brown rot incidence was observed. AP6 and PL5 showed no significant differences in efficacy when applied at 1 \u00d7 108 cells/mL or at 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL, indicating that they could be used at a lower concentration in potential biofungicide formulations. Finally, in an experiment in semi-commercial conditions on fruit not inoculated with the pathogen with 21 d storage at 1 \u00b0C and 96% RH, the evaluation of postharvest quality parameters, including firmness, total soluble solids, ascorbic acid content, and titratable acidity, showed that none of the three screened antagonists impaired peach quality, when applied before storage. The present study identified three antagonistic microorganisms with potential exploitation as active ingredients for the development of products for postharvest control of brown rot on peaches.", "label": 0}

Spores of nonvirulent Bacillus anthracis strains 7702, ANR-1, and 9131 were mixed with water, flour paste, whole milk, or egg yolk emulsion and dried onto stainless-steel carriers. The carriers were exposed to various concentrations of peroxyacetic acid, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), or hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) for 10 min at 10, 20, or 30 degrees C, after which time the survivors were quantified. The relationship between peroxyacetic acid concentration, H(2)O(2) concentration, and spore inactivation followed a sigmoid curve that was accurately described using a four-parameter logistic model. At 20 degrees C, the minimum concentrations of peroxyacetic acid, H(2)O(2), and NaOCl (as total available chlorine) predicted to inactivate 6 log(10) CFU of B. anthracis spores with no food residue present were 1.05, 23.0, and 0.78%, respectively. At 10 degrees C, sodium hypochlorite at 5% total available chlorine did not inactivate more than 4 log(10) CFU. The presence of the food residues had only a minimal effect on peroxyacetic acid and H(2)O(2) sporicidal efficacy, but the efficacy of sodium hypochlorite was markedly inhibited by whole-milk and egg yolk residues. Sodium hypochlorite at 5% total available chlorine provided no greater than a 2-log(10) CFU reduction when spores were in the presence of egg yolk residue. This research provides new information regarding the usefulness of peroxygen biocides for B. anthracis spore inactivation when food residue is present. This work also provides guidance for adjusting decontamination procedures for food-soiled and cold surfaces.", "label": 1}
{"id": "1429", "title": "Effects of water matrix on virus inactivation using common virucidal techniques for condensate urine disinfection", "abstract": "Three common virucidal techniques (chlorine, UV and UV/TiO2) were applied to inactivate virus (MS2 and Phi X174) in condensate water after the evaporation of source-separated urine for reclaimed water. The inactivation efficiencies were compared with the results of previous studies, with the emphasis on the analysis of water matrix effects. Results showed that all virus inactivation in condensate water were lower than the control (in sterilized DI water). As for UV/TiO2 disinfection, both nitrate and ammonia nitrogen could promote slightly viral inactivation, while the inhibition by urea was dominant. Similarly, ammonia nitrogen had greater impacts on chlorine disinfection than urea and nitrate. In contrast, all water matrices (urea, nitrate and ammonia nitrogen) had little influence on UV disinfection. Based on the findings in this study, UV disinfection could be recommended for disinfecting the reclaimed water from the evaporation of source-separated urine.", "label": 1}

The enzyme purified from recombinant Escherichia coli had a molecular mass of about 35 kDa on SDS-PAGE and only required NADPH as an electron donor. The K(m) value of PsCR for ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate was 4.9 mg/mL and the corresponding V(max) was 337 micromol/mg protein/min. The catalytic efficiency value was the highest ever reported for reductases from yeasts. Moreover, PsCR exhibited a medium-range substrate spectrum toward various keto and aldehyde compounds, i.e., ethyl-3-oxobutanoate with a chlorine substitution at the 2 or 4-position, or alpha,beta-diketones. In addition, the activity of the enzyme was strongly inhibited by SDS and beta-mercaptoethanol, but not by ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid.", "label": 0}

These polyphenols can interact with chlorine or nitrite to yield new derivatives. Generally, these new products possess more mutagenic potential than their original compounds. Furthermore, the mutagenicity of these polyphenols and their derivatives can be dramatically reduced by rodent liver microsomal enzymes (S9). The mutagenicity of polyphenols is in this order: hydroquinone > 1,2,4-benzenetriol > pyrogallol, while catechol, resorcinol and phloroglucinol are non-mutagenic. The ultimate product of chlorination or nitrosation of hydroquinone has been identified to be p-benzoquinone. The formation of active oxygen species including superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by polyphenols has been demonstrated and this may contribute partly to the molecular mechanisms of polyphenol mutagenicity.", "label": 0}
{"id": "7927", "title": "Photocatalytic disinfection of water polluted by pseudomonas aeruginosa", "abstract": "Photocatalysis by titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a water treatment method. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a microorganism resistant to chlorine and UV-C irradiation. TiO2 photocatalytic technology can destroy bacteria, which are resistant to oxidative destruction of cell membrane caused by sole UV irradiation. This study aims to investigate the total mineralization of the bacterium (P. aeruginosa) to the extent of death and cell-mass destruction using TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation process. In this work the effects of parameters such as amount of TiO2, irradiation time, initial concentration of bacterium, presence of ascorbic acid and effect of cell wall on removal of P. aeruginosa were studied. The data, which were obtained in this study, showed that the optimum concentration of TiO2 was 325 ppm. Also at the initial concentration of TiO2 equal to 325 ppm and initial microorganism MPN / 100 ml equal to 300 and after 75 min UV irradiation time, P. aeruginosa removal efficiency was 94.3%. Removal efficiency of P. aeruginosa in the absence of TiO2 or UV irradiation was very low. Decreasing the concentration of microorganisms increased its removal efficiency. Removal efficiency of spheroplast cells was more than intact cells of P. aeruginosa, which shows the important role of cell wall on cell resistance against chemical agents. Ascorbic acid had inhibitory effect on this process.", "label": 0}
{"id": "4015", "title": "Electron microscopic investigation of the bactericidal action of electrochemical disinfection in comparison with chlorination, ozonation and Fenton reaction", "abstract": "Laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the mechanisms of electrochemical (EC) disinfection of artificial wastewater contaminated by Escherichia coli culture. Comparative disinfection tests with chlorine, ozone and hydroxyl (OH?) radicals produced by the Fenton reaction were also conducted. It was demonstrated that the EC process was highly effective for wastewater disinfection. Investigation with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed different appearances of damage to in the surface morphology and structure of the cells after different forms of disinfection. Substantial leakage of intracellular materials was found for the E. coli cells after EC disinfection, which was also observed for the cells treated by the Fenton reaction. However, such cell lysis was noticeable to a less extent for the ozonated cells and hardly noticeable for the chlorinated cells. Electron microscopic examination suggested that the cells were likely inactivated during the EC process by the chemical products with an oxidising power similar to that of hydroxyl radicals and much stronger than that of chlorine. The SEM results support the hypothesis that the predominant killing action of EC disinfection is provided by high-energy intermediate EC products. Therefore, in addition to electro-chlorination, the great capacity of EC disinfection may be attributable to the generation of short-lived germicidal agents, such as free radicals.", "label": 1}

A new disinfection method was studied where there no THM is formed, and where chloramine synthesized in seawater is effectively used as a biocide. At the seawater intake, NH4Cl is injected and NaOCl soln. is added at optimal dosing conditions to produce monochloramine, the best disinfectant among several chloramines, at a rate >90%. From seawater desalination test results, it was confirmed that there were no THM in chloramine-disinfected seawater nor in RO permeate water after secondary Cl disinfection. This new chloramine disinfection method is worthy of note since it will be most useful in strict drinking water quality control. [on SciFinder(R)]", "label": 1}

Twelve out of the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity using two different screening protocols; namely, the formalin-induced paw edema and the turpentine oil-induced granuloma pouch bioassays, using diclofenac Na as a reference standard. The ulcerogenic effects and acute toxicity (ALD50) values of these compounds were also determined. Meanwhile, the analgesic activity of the same compounds was evaluated using the rat tail withdrawal technique. Additionally, the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity. In general, compounds belonging to the thiazolylantipyrine series exhibited better biological activities than their thiadiazolyl structure variants. Collectively, compounds 6, 10, 26, and 27 proved to display distinctive anti-inflammatory and analgesic profiles with a fast onset of action. All of the tested compounds revealed super GI safety profile and are well tolerated by the experimental animals with high safety margin (ALD50 &gt; 3.0 g/kg).

We have searched the medical literature to review the many aspects of the problem and the opinions of various authors. The increasing importance of allergic diseases and their relationship to sinus disease have been evaluated through a review of relevant literature. The poorly understood variations of the presentation of sinusitis and its signs and symptoms in the pediatric age group have been reviewed. Recommendations concerning the method, duration, and timing of the therapeutic intervention or interventions are summarized. The natural course of pediatric sinusitis in association with related respiratory tract diseases is discussed. Allergies and viral upper respiratory infections are among the most common predisposing factors of sinus disease. Every child with sinusitis is a candidate for an allergy evaluation.

We assessed the effect of such prophylaxis on morbidity, mortality, CD4-cell count, and viral load among people with HIV infection living in rural Uganda, an area with high rates of bacterial resistance to co-trimoxazole. Methods Between April, 2001, and March, 2003, we enrolled, and followed up with weekly home visits, 509 individuals with HIV-1 infection and their 1522 HIV-negative household members. After 5 months of follow-up, HIV-positive participants were offered daily co-trimoxazole prophylaxis (800 mg trimethoprim, 160 mg sulphamethoxazole) and followed up for a further 1\u00b75 years. We assessed rates of malaria, diarrhoea, hospital admission, and death. Findings Co-trimoxazole was well tolerated with rare (&lt;2% per person-year) adverse reactions. Even though rates of resistance in diarrhoeal pathogens were high (76%), co-trimoxazole prophylaxis was associated with a 46% reduction in mortality (hazard ratio 0\u00b754 [95% CI 0\u00b735\u20130\u00b784], p=0\u00b7006) and lower rates of malaria (multivariate incidence rate ratio 0\u00b728 [0\u00b719\u20130\u00b740], p&lt;0\u00b70001), diarrhoea (0\u00b765 [0\u00b753\u20130\u00b781], p&lt;0\u00b70001), and hospital admission (0\u00b769 [0\u00b748\u20130\u00b798], p=0\u00b704). The annual rate of decline in CD4-cell count was less during prophylaxis than before (77 vs 203 cells per ?L, p&lt;0\u00b70001), and the annual rate of increase in viral load was lower (0\u00b708 vs 0\u00b790 log10 copies per mL, p=0\u00b701).
